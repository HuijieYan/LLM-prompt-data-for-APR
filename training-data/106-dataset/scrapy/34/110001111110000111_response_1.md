The error occurs in the `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond` test case when checking the `D.fields` attribute. The fields are expected to be merged from classes B and C, but instead, it seems like the `fields` attribute is being overridden.

The potential error location is within the `ItemMeta` class where the `__new__` method is defined.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is not correctly merging the `fields` attribute from the base classes. Instead, it is overriding the `fields` attribute when creating a new class.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__new__` method to correctly merge the `fields` attribute from the base classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    fields.update(attrs.get('fields', {}))
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected method, the `fields` attribute will be correctly merged from the base classes, and the test case should pass without errors.
