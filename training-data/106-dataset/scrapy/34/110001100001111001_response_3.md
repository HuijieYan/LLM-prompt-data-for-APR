The problem with the given code is that it seems to be an overridden `__new__` method for a metaclass. The intention of this method is to filter out the Field instances from the provided attributes and store them in a dictionary named `fields`. However, it seems to have multiple issues causing the function to return incorrect values.

It seems that the original intention was to create a new class that is a subclass of the original class and start accessing its attributes in order to filter them. However, the code inside the loop for `dir(_class)` is attempting to access attributes directly from the original class, which may cause issues.

In order to fix the issue, we can make changes to the traversal of class attributes and create a new class with filtered attributes.

Based on this analysis, the corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {name: attr for name, attr in attrs.items() if isinstance(attr, Field)}
    new_attrs = {name: attr for name, attr in attrs.items() if name not in fields}

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
