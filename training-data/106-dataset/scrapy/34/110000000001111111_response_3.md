The bug in the provided code is that the function `__new__` is not correctly merging the fields from the base classes. Instead, it is overriding the fields, leading to potential key errors.

The issue appears to be with the following block of code:
```python
new_attrs['fields'] = fields
new_attrs['_class'] = _class
return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

The `new_attrs['fields']` is being assigned the `fields` dictionary, which is only including the fields from the current class and not the inherited fields from the base classes.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to correctly merge the fields from the base classes and the current class. This can be done by iterating through the base classes and merging their fields into the `fields` dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        for n in dir(base):
            v = getattr(base, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v

    fields.update({n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)})
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected code, the `fields` dictionary will now correctly merge the fields from the base classes and the current class, ensuring that there are no overrides and potential key errors.
