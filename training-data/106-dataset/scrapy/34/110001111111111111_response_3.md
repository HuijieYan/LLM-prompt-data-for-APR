The bug is likely located in the section where the `fields` dictionary is being constructed. It seems that the `fields` dictionary is being overwritten instead of merged when new bases are being added.

The bug occurs because the code overwrites the `fields` dictionary when merging bases. This causes the new fields to replace the old ones instead of being merged into a single dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should merge the `fields` dictionaries from the different bases instead of overwriting them. We can do this by updating the `fields` dictionary with the fields from the current class and its bases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    fields.update(attrs.get('fields', {}))

    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this correction, the `fields` dictionary will be merged from the bases and the current class, preventing the overwriting issue and fixing the bug.
