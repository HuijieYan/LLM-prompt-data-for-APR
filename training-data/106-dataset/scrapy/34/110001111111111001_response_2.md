The error occurs because the fields dictionary is not being populated correctly in the function, resulting in missing fields in the final output.

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates over the attributes of the class and populates the `fields` variable.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly populating the `fields` dictionary. This is due to the incorrect use of `new_attrs` as the return value instead of constructing new bases for the class.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly populate the `fields` dictionary and return a new class with the correct attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    new_attrs.update(fields)
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
