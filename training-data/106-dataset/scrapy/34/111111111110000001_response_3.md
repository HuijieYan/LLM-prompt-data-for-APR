The error message is indicating that the `D.fields` dictionary is not as expected. It seems that the `fields` dictionary is not being constructed properly within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class.

The potential error in the code is that the `fields` dictionary is not being updated correctly with the expected values for each class. The current implementation is not correctly handling the multiple inheritance and is not merging the fields from parent classes as expected.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class is not collecting the `fields` from the parent classes (`A`, `B`, `C`) in the correct manner, causing discrepancies in the final `fields` dictionary for the `D` and `E` classes.

To fix this, the `__new__` method needs to be updated to correctly handle multiple inheritance and merge the fields from the parent classes. Also, the `new_attrs` needs to be updated properly with the correct fields.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in reversed(new_bases):
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code appropriately collects the `fields` from the parent classes and updates the `new_attrs` with the correct fields into the final class. This should resolve the issue.
