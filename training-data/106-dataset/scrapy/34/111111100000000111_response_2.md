The bug in the provided code is that the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class is not merging the `fields` attribute, instead, it is overriding it in the new_attrs dictionary.

The reason behind this bug is that in the `__new__` method, the `fields` dictionary is being overwritten in the `new_attrs` dictionary. This leads to the loss of any existing `fields` attributes in the `attrs` dictionary.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `__new__` method to correctly merge the `fields` attribute:

```python
# fixed __new__ method
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:  # merge fields from bases
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n, v in attrs.items():  # merge fields from attrs
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields  # store merged fields in new_attrs
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This modified `__new__` method correctly merges the `fields` attribute from the base classes and the `attrs` dictionary, and then stores the merged fields in the `new_attrs` dictionary. This should fix the bug where the fields were being overridden instead of merged.
