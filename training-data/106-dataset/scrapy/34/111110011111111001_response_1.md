The error occurs in the comparison of the `D.fields` attribute in the test function. The expected fields include the 'update' field, which is missing from the actual fields.

The bug occurs in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The method is incorrectly handling the inheritance of fields, resulting in missing fields in the final class definition.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic in the `__new__` method to properly handle the inheritance of fields from the base classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            for field_name, field_value in base.fields.items():
                fields[field_name] = field_value
    for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(attr_value, Field):
            fields[attr_name] = attr_value
        else:
            new_attrs[attr_name] = attr_value

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the updated `__new__` method, we loop through the base classes to collect all the fields and then add the fields from the current class. We also keep track of non-field attributes in `new_attrs`. Finally, we update `new_attrs` with the combined fields and return the new class. This corrected logic ensures that fields are properly inherited and retained in the final class definition.
