Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the implementation of the __new__ method in the provided code. It looks like the __new__ method is not correctly merging the fields which is causing it to override the existing fields.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because the implementation of the __new__ method is not correctly merging the fields. Instead of merging the fields, it overrides the existing fields which causes the key error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to create a new dictionary that combines the fields from the current class and the base classes.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_34/scrapy/item.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    # Merge fields from base classes
    fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    # Add fields from current class
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

The corrected code first creates a new dictionary 'fields' by merging the fields from the base classes. It then adds the fields from the current class to the 'fields' dictionary. Finally, it updates the 'attrs' dictionary with the merged fields and returns the updated 'attrs'.
