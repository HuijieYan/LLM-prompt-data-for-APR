Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The method is supposed to merge the fields from the base classes, but instead, it overrides them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is happening because the `__new__` method is not correctly merging the fields from the base classes. Instead, it is simply overriding the fields from the immediate base class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to properly merge the fields from all base classes. This can be achieved by iterating through all base classes and merging their fields into a new dictionary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __new__ method
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for base in new_bases:
            if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
                fields.update(base.fields)
        for n in attrs:
            v = attrs[n]
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
With this corrected code, the `__new__` method will properly merge the fields from all base classes instead of overriding them. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
