The buggy function is `__new__` and it seems that the issue lies within the last portion where a new instance of `ItemMeta` is being created and returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the original code is not correctly handling the attributes and fields when creating the new instance of `ItemMeta`. It is also not fully considering the inheritance and attributes of the base classes.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the inheritance and attributes from the base classes and ensure that the fields are properly included. Also, the new instance of `ItemMeta` should have the correct attributes and fields.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    fields = {}
    
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(attr_value, Field):
            fields[attr_name] = attr_value
        else:
            new_attrs[attr_name] = attr_value
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, (Item,), new_attrs)
    
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, (Item,), new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, we properly handle the inheritance by updating the `fields` dictionary with fields from the base classes. Then, we iterate through the `attrs` and add them to the `new_attrs` if they are not fields. Finally, we set the `fields` and `_class` attributes in the `new_attrs` and create a new instance of `ItemMeta` using these updated attributes.
