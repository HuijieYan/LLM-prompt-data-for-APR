Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the way the `fields` dictionary is being constructed in the function. It looks like the current implementation overrides the `fields` dictionary instead of merging it, leading to a key error.

Reasons behind the bug:
The current implementation of the function constructs a new `fields` dictionary within a loop, but instead of merging it with the existing `fields` dictionary, it overrides it. This leads to the loss of existing fields and causes a key error when trying to access them later.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `fields` dictionary is being constructed. Instead of overriding it within the loop, we should merge the new fields with the existing ones.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
