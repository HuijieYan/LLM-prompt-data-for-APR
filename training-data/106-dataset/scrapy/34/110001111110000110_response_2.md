# Corrected function/source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_34/scrapy/item.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        for field, value in getattr(base, 'fields', {}).items():
            fields.setdefault(field, value)
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)

```

The issue was caused by the function overriding fields instead of merging them. The corrected function will merge the fields from the base classes before adding the new fields, ensuring that they are not overridden.
