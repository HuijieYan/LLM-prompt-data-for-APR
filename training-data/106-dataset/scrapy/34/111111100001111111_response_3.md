The error occurs because the function is simply overwriting the `fields` in the `attrs` dictionary instead of merging it with the existing `fields`. This causes the fields to be overridden in some cases, leading to key errors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to merge the `fields` with the existing `attrs['fields']` instead of overwriting it.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    for n in attrs:
        if n in fields:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = {**getattr(attrs, 'fields', {}), **fields}
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, I modified the function to merge the `fields` with the existing `attrs['fields']` using dictionary unpacking `{**getattr(attrs, 'fields', {}), **fields}`. This ensures that the fields are merged instead of being overridden.

This should resolve the issue of the function overriding fields instead of merging them, as described in the bug report.
