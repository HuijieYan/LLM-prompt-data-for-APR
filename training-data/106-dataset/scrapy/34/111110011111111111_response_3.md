The test case `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond` creates a class `D` by inheriting from classes `B` and `C`, and then checks the fields of class `D`. The error message indicates that the fields of class `D` are being overridden instead of merged, leading to a key error.

The potential error location seems to be in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class, where the fields of the classes are not being merged properly.

The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class overrides the fields of the inherited classes instead of merging them. As a result, the merged fields are not being correctly represented in the `D` class, leading to the key error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should merge the fields of the inherited classes rather than overriding them. A parameter, which is currently represented as `fields`, should be updated appropriately to ensure that the fields are merged correctly.

The corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class is as follows:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected implementation, the `fields` are merged by iterating through the bases and updating the `fields` dict with the fields from each base. Then, the `new_attrs` are updated with the merged `fields` before returning the new attributes. This should ensure that the fields are correctly merged when creating the class.
