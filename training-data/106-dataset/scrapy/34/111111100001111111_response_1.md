The bug occurs because the buggy function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class is overwriting the `fields` attribute instead of merging it with the existing `fields` attribute. This causes key errors when trying to access the `fields` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `fields` from the new class should be merged with the existing `fields` attribute. Additionally, the `attrs` should be updated with the merged `fields` and the `_class`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = {**fields, **attrs.pop('fields', {})}  # Merge fields with existing attrs
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, bases, new_attrs)  # Update with merged fields and _class
```

With this corrected code, the `fields` from the new class are merged with the existing `fields` attribute, and the `attrs` are updated with the merged `fields` and the `_class`. This should fix the bug and prevent key errors when accessing the `fields` attribute.
