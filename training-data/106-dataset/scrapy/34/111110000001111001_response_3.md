The bug in the provided code is within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The bug is related to the construction of the new class that inherits from the `ItemMeta` class. The logic inside the for loop that iterates over the attributes of the new class and checks for instances of the `Field` class is incorrect. It should be done over the `attrs` parameter instead of the `_class` parameter.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __new__ method
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(attrs):
            v = getattr(attrs, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over the `attrs` parameter received by the `__new__` method, and we check for instances of the `Field` class and other attributes using the `dir()` function. This ensures that we correctly gather the fields and their values for the new class.
