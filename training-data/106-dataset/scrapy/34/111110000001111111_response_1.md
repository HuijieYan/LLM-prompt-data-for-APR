This buggy function is supposed to merge the fields from the base classes with the current class's fields, but it is instead overriding the fields. This is causing issues when the same field names exist in multiple base classes.

The issue occurs because the function only considers the fields from the current class and does not merge them with the fields from the base classes.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the base classes and merge their fields with the fields from the current class. It should also update the 'fields' attribute in the new_attrs dictionary with the merged fields.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

    merged_fields = {}
    for base_class in bases:
        if hasattr(base_class, 'fields'):
            merged_fields.update(base_class.fields)
    merged_fields.update({name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field)})

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = merged_fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
