The error message from the test function shows that the `D.fields` value is not equal to the expected value. This indicates that the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is not generating the correct `fields` attribute for the `D` class, which causes the test to fail.

The issue is likely located in the part of the `__new__` method where the `fields` dictionary is being constructed. It seems that the code is not correctly accumulating the `fields` attributes from the base classes, and the result is incorrect when multiple inheritance is involved.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the `fields` attribute is being built within the `__new__` method. We can iterate over the base classes and merge their `fields` dictionaries into a single dictionary for the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, we accumulate the `fields` dictionaries from the base classes into a single dictionary and then update it with any `fields` attributes defined in the current class. This ensures that the `fields` attribute is correctly inherited and merged when using multiple inheritance.
