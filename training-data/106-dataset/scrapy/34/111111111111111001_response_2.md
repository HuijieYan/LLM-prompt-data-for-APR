The error occurs in the comparison `self.assertEqual(D.fields, {'save': {'default': 'C'}, 'load': {'default': 'D'}, 'update': {'default': 'D'}})` inside the test function. The fields attribute of class D is not containing the expected values, which leads to the assertion error.

The bug is located in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The current implementation is incorrect as it does not properly handle the inheritance and combination of fields from different base classes.

The bug occurs because the code only handles fields from the immediate class and does not consider the fields from the base classes correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to properly handle the fields from the base classes and combine them into the new class' fields.

Below is the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_base_fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            new_base_fields.update(base.fields)
    new_fields = {**new_base_fields, **attrs.get('fields', {})}

    new_attrs = {**attrs, 'fields': new_fields}
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected method, it properly combines the fields from the base classes and the current class into the new class' fields and returns the expected result for the test case.
