The issue with the provided function is that it is overriding the 'fields' attribute in the new_attrs dictionary, instead of merging it with the existing 'fields' attribute. This results in the loss of any fields defined in the base classes.

To fix this issue, we need to merge the 'fields' attribute from the base classes with the 'fields' attribute in the attrs dictionary before constructing the new_attrs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
