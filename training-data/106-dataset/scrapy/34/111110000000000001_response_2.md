The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect usage of the `super` function, and the incorrect return statement at the end of the function. 

The bug occurs because the `super` function is called with the original class_name, bases, and attrs, instead of the modified ones. This means that the previous class is being created instead of the modified one.

To fix this bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
