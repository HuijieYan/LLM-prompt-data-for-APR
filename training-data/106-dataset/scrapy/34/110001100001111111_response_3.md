The bug in the provided function lies in the line where the 'ItemMeta' class is instantiated using the '__new__' method. Instead of merging the 'fields' in the 'attrs' dictionary, the function is currently overriding the 'fields' in 'new_attrs'. This results in the loss of existing fields and only the latest one being retained.

The reason behind this bug is that the function incorrectly overwrites the 'fields' in 'attrs' with the 'fields' from the newly created class '_class'. This causes the loss of existing fields in 'attrs' during the merge process.

To fix this bug, the function should merge the 'fields' from the newly created class '_class' with the existing 'fields' in 'attrs' while creating the 'new_attrs' dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    fields.update(attrs.get('fields', {}))  # Merge existing fields with new fields
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the 'fields' from the 'attrs' dictionary are merged with the fields extracted from the '_class', and then added to the 'new_attrs' dictionary. This ensures that the existing fields are retained and merged with the new fields, addressing the bug.
