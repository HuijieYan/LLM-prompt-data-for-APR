The issue in the buggy function is that the return value is not being correctly constructed. The function is trying to create a new class based on the input parameters and attributes. However, the logic for constructing the new class using the `__new__` method is incorrect, leading to incorrect attributes in the generated class.

To fix this issue, the logic for constructing the new class needs to be modified. The fields and attributes should be correctly passed to the new class without losing any information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    
    for n in dir(attrs):
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            new_attrs[n] = v
    
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['_class'] = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
    
    return new_attrs['_class']
```

In this corrected code, the logic has been changed to correctly extract the fields and update the attributes. The class is then created using these updated attributes and is returned as the result. This should fix the issues with creating the new class and preserve all the necessary attribute information.
