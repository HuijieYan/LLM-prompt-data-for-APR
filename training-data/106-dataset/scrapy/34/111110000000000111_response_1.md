The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it overrides the 'fields' attribute instead of merging it with the existing 'fields' attribute.

The bug occurred because the function was not properly merging the 'fields' attribute, leading to it being overridden instead of combined with the existing 'fields' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly merge the 'fields' attribute with the existing 'fields' attribute, instead of overriding it. We can achieve this by updating the 'new_attrs' dictionary to include both the existing 'fields' attribute and the new 'fields' attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    if '_class' in attrs:
        new_attrs['_class'] = attrs['_class']

    new_attrs['fields'] = {**getattr(_class, 'fields', {}), **fields}
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we're using the dictionary unpacking operator to merge the existing 'fields' attribute with the new 'fields' attribute, ensuring that the 'fields' attribute is correctly merged instead of overridden.
