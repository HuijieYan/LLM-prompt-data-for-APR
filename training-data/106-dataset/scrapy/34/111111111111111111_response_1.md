The problem seems to be occurring in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The current implementation is overriding the `fields` attribute instead of merging it. This is causing issues when the class inherits from multiple parent classes with different `fields` attributes.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__new__` method to merge the `fields` attributes instead of overriding them. We can achieve this by updating the `fields` attribute with the values from the parent classes before returning the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this implementation, the `fields` attribute will be merged from all the parent classes before creating the new class, ensuring that no data is overridden. This should fix the issue with the test case failing and provide the expected behavior for multiple inheritance with different `fields` attributes.
