The error occurs in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The function is supposed to merge the fields from all parent classes, but it is currently overriding the fields instead.

The reason behind this bug is that the `__new__` method is creating a new `new_attrs` dictionary, but then it is overriding the entire `fields` entry in this dictionary with the `fields` dictionary from the current class.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__new__` method to merge the `fields` dictionaries from all the parent classes, instead of overriding them.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    # Merge fields from all parent classes
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            fields.update(getattr(base._class, 'fields', {}))

    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected implementation will merge the `fields` dictionaries from all parent classes, as expected, and resolve the issue described in the error message.
