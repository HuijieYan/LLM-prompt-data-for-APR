Potential Error:
The error in the given code lies in the use of the `__new__` method. The code attempts to modify the attributes and bases of the class in the `__new__` method, but it does not handle the modification correctly. Additionally, the return statement of the `__new__` method is incorrect.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is not correctly modifying the bases and attributes of the class, and the return statement is not providing the correct result.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly modify the bases and attributes of the class within the `__new__` method.
2. Implement a correct return statement that reflects the modified class.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field)}
    new_attrs = {name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if name not in fields}
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, new_attrs)
```
