The error message is indicating that the `ItemMeta` is overriding fields instead of merging them. This means that when a class inherits from multiple base classes, the fields from the base classes are not being properly merged.

The potential error location within the `ItemMeta` function seems to be in the section where it creates `new_attrs` and updates the `fields` and `_class` attributes. The current implementation is not correctly merging the fields from the base classes.

The bug occurs because the `new_attrs` dictionary is being created to store the attributes of the new class, and the `fields` dictionary is being updated with the fields from the current class only, not from its base classes. This results in the overriding of fields instead of merging them.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to iterate through the base classes and merge their fields with the `fields` dictionary, before updating the `new_attrs` dictionary. Then, use the merged `fields` dictionary to update the `new_attrs['fields']`. Also, make sure to update the `new_attrs` dictionary with the attributes from the current class, before calling the superclass's `__new__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `ItemMeta` function:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    merged_fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            merged_fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            merged_fields[n] = v
    new_attrs['fields'] = merged_fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
With these changes, the `fields` from all the base classes will be properly merged into the `merged_fields` dictionary, and then used to update the `new_attrs['fields']`. This should ensure that the fields are merged instead of being overridden, fixing the issue described in the GitHub report.
