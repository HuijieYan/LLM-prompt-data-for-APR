Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the logic for constructing the `new_attrs` dictionary within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not correctly filtering and constructing the `fields` and `new_attrs` dictionaries when iterating through the attributes of the `_class`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of using a loop to iterate over the attributes of `_class`, a more efficient approach would be to directly access the `__dict__` attribute of the `_class` and filter the attributes based on whether they are instances of the `Field` class.
2. Secondly, the construction of the `fields` should be based on the filtered attributes, and the `new_attrs` dictionary can be directly updated accordingly.

Corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {name: value for name, value in _class.__dict__.items() if isinstance(value, Field)}
    new_attrs = {name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if name in dir(_class)}

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
