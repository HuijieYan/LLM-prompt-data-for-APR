The error message "TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str" indicates that the function `startswith` expects the argument to be of type bytes or a tuple of bytes, not a string.

The potential error location within the `_parse_sitemap` function is the line `if line.lstrip().startswith('Sitemap:')` because it's trying to compare a string ('Sitemap:') with a bytes object returned by `lstrip()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that in Python 3, the response body is returned as bytes, not as a string. When the `lstrip()` function is called on the response body, it returns a bytes object, and then `startswith` is called with a string argument, which causes the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `startswith` is called with a bytes object instead of a string. One approach is to encode the string 'Sitemap:' to bytes using the `encode()` function before using it with `startswith`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s", {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
