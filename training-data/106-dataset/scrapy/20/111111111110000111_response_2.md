The error is occurring in the function `_parse_sitemap` of the SitemapSpider class, specifically in the line `for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):`. The error message indicates that the `startswith` function is expecting bytes or a tuple of bytes, not a string, which suggests that the function `sitemap_urls_from_robots` is expecting bytes as input, but receiving a string instead.

The reason behind this bug is likely due to changes in Python 3.x, where strings and bytes are handled differently. It's possible that the `response.body` is returning a string, while `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function is expecting bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input to `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function is in the correct format. If `response.body` is a string, we need to encode it to bytes before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body.encode('utf-8')):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

With this correction, the input to `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function is encoded to bytes before being processed, resolving the error.
