The buggy function is intended to parse a sitemap, and in particular, it should handle the case when the response is a robots.txt file. It appears to be correctly identifying the sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file, but the problem may be with how it processes those URLs.

The bug seems to be in the recursive call to `_parse_sitemap` when handling sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file. The function should be yielding a `Request` to `_parse_sitemap`, but it is doing so without considering the result of the recursive call. This could lead to an infinite loop if not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should ensure that the URLs obtained from robots.txt are not processed again, and also handle the case when a sitemap URL from robots.txt points to another robots.txt file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.text):  # Use response.text to get the content
            if not url.endswith('/robots.txt'):  # Avoid infinite loop by skipping robots.txt URLs
                yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if the retrieved URL from robots.txt is another robots.txt file. If it is, we skip it. Also, we replaced `response.body` with `response.text` to get the content.

These modifications should prevent any infinite loops and handle the parsing of sitemaps from robots.txt files appropriately.
