The error appears to be occurring in the function `_parse_sitemap` of the `SitemapSpider` class. The error message, `TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str`, indicates that the `startswith` method is being called with a string argument, while it should be bytes or a tuple of bytes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the use of the `response.body` attribute. When extracting URLs from the `robots.txt` file, it's important to ensure that the text is in bytes format, not a string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `response.body` is used, it returns the content of the response in bytes format. However, when processing the lines using `line.lstrip().startswith('Sitemap:')`, it's treating the strings as Unicode, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `response.body` should be decoded to a string using the appropriate encoding. Then, when processing the lines, the `startswith` method should be called with bytes or a tuple of bytes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.text.encode('utf-8')):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In this corrected code, `response.text` is encoded to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding and passed to `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function to extract URLs. This approach ensures that the comparison and operations in the subsequent processing are done using bytes, preventing the TypeError that was previously occurring.
