The error occurs when the test function `test_get_sitemap_urls_from_robotstxt` is run. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, where it checks if a line from the robots.txt file starts with 'Sitemap:'. This check is raising a `TypeError` because the function is expecting `bytes` as the first argument, but it is receiving a `str` object instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to compare a `bytes` object with a `str` object when checking the start of the line in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

To fix this bug, the `robots_text` in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function should be decoded to a string using the appropriate encoding. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        robots_text = response.body.decode('utf-8')  # decode the bytes to a string
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(robots_text):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        ...
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

After making this change, the `TypeError` should be resolved, and the function should work correctly.
