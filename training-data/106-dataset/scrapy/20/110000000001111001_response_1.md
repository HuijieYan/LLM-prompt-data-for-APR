The potential error in the code is that the function is not properly handling the case when `response.url` ends with '/robots.txt'. The code should iterate through the sitemap URLs obtained from the robots.txt file and then parse each sitemap URL recursively. It can be assumed that the bug is related to the handling of the sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file.

The bug occurs because when the response URL ends with '/robots.txt', the function should be iterating over the sitemap URLs obtained from the robots.txt file and then recursively parsing each sitemap URL. However, the bug in the current code prevents proper parsing of the sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file.

To fix the bug, the function should properly iterate over the sitemap URLs obtained from the robots.txt file, and then recursively parse each sitemap URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.linkextractors import SitemapLinkExtractor
from scrapy.spiders import SitemapSpider
import logging

class CustomSitemapSpider(SitemapSpider):
    name = 'custom_sitemap_spider'

    def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
        if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
            sitemap_urls = sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.text)  # Assuming sitemap_urls_from_robots is a custom function
            for url in sitemap_urls:
                yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        else:
            sitemap_links = SitemapLinkExtractor().extract_links(response)
            for link in sitemap_links:
                yield Request(link.url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
``` 

In this corrected code, the `_parse_sitemap` function handles the case when `response.url` ends with '/robots.txt' by first extracting the sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file and then recursively parsing each sitemap URL. When `response.url` does not end with '/robots.txt', the function extracts the sitemap links from the response and recursively parses each sitemap link.
