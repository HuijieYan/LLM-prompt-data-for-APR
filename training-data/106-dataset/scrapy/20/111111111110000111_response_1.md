The error occurs in the `_parse_sitemap` function of the `SitemapSpider` class from the `sitemap.py` file. The error is because the `robots_text` variable is of type bytes, and the `startswith` method is being called with a string argument.

The reason behind the bug is that in Python 3, the `startswith` method expects its argument to be of type bytes when the string it is being called on is of type bytes. This is causing a `TypeError` in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `robots_text` variable is converted to a string before calling the `startswith` method. This can be achieved by decoding the `robots_text` to a string using the appropriate encoding method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body.decode('utf-8')):  # decoding the bytes to string
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

By decoding the `robots_text` to a string, we ensure that the `startswith` method is called with the correct type, resolving the `TypeError` and fixing the bug.
