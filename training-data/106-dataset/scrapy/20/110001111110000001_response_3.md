1. The test case is trying to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt using the `_parse_sitemap` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the `startswith` method, which suggests that there might be an issue with the data type being used in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

2. The potential error location is likely within the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

3. The error occurs because the `robots_text` is of type `bytes` (indicated by the `b` prefix in front of the string literals), and the `startswith` method is being called with a string literal ('Sitemap:'). This results in a `TypeError` because the `startswith` method expects bytes or a tuple of bytes, not a string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the string we're comparing with using `startswith` is also encoded as bytes, or we can decode the `robots_text` to a string before performing the string comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith(b'/robots.txt'):  # Ensure `robots.txt` is treated as bytes
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
