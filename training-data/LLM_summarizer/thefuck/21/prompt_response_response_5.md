The issue with the provided `match` function is that it attempts to split the `command.script` without first checking if there are enough elements to access the desired index. This results in an IndexError when the script contains only 'git' without any subsequent arguments.

To fix this bug, the function should first split the script and then check if the length of the split is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the comparison is only made if there is a second word in the script, preventing any index out of range errors. The corrected function should now work as intended for the given input parameters and variable values, resolving the bug and allowing the `git_fix_stash` rule to function properly.
