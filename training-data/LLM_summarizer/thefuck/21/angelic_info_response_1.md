The given function is intended to take in a command and check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. 

However, there are several issues in the code.
1. The function is supposed to access the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object, but the original code references undefined variables `command.script` and `command.stderr`.
2. The logic is also incorrect as it will raise an error if either `script` or `stderr` is empty.

To fix these issues, we need to access the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object correctly, and also handle the case when they may be empty.

Here is the corrected function code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code correctly accesses the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object and also handles the case when the `script` is empty. It first checks if the `script` contains at least two words, and then checks the second word for 'stash'. Finally, it checks if 'usage:' is in the `stderr` attribute. This code should now satisfy the expected behavior and pass the specified test cases.
