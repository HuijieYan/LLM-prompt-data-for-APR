The function is designed to take an input parameter called `command` and check if the `command.script` contains the word 'stash' and the `command.stderr` contains the phrase 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

Based on the provided code, the function looks for the word 'stash' in `command.script` and the phrase 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. If both are present, it should return `True`.

However, the function is currently failing its test cases.

To understand why the function is failing, let's analyze the behavior of the function based on the given inputs and expected outputs.

Given input:
- `command.script`: `'git'`
- `command`: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=usage: git stash list [<options>]   or: git stash show [<stash>]   or: git stash drop [-q`
- `command.stderr`: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'`

Expected output:
The expected behavior of the function, given the input values, is that it should return `False`. This is because the word 'stash' does not appear in the `command.script` and the phrase 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

Upon revisiting the source code, it appears that the code is checking for the word 'stash' in the wrong place. It should be checking for 'stash' in `command.stderr` and 'usage:' in `command.script`.

The corrected code should look like this:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.stderr
            and 'usage:' in command.script)
```

By swapping the conditions, the function now correctly matches the expected behavior. The word 'stash' is checked in `command.stderr`, and 'usage:' is checked in `command.script`.

This correction should ensure that the function returns the expected output based on the specified conditions and inputs.
