## Summary:
The issue is related to a failure in the `git_fix_stash` rule of `thefuck` when the script is just `git`. The bug causes a `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the `git_fix_stash` rule is unable to handle the situation when the script is just `git`.

This issue prevents the proper execution of the `git_fix_stash` rule, impacting the functionality and effectiveness of the `thefuck` tool in scenarios where the script is solely `git`.

The specific error is traced back to the `git_fix_stash.py` file, specifically in the `match` function, where the `split()` method is performed on the `command.script` and ultimately leads to a list index out of range.

The bug affects the core functionality of the `git_fix_stash` rule, thereby impeding the seamless usage of `thefuck` in scenarios involving the `git` command without any additional arguments.

Resolving this bug is crucial to ensure uninterrupted and efficient usage of the `thefuck` tool, especially in scenarios where the `git` command is used alone or without any arguments.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate the root cause of the `IndexError` occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.
2. Analyze the behavior of the `split()` method on the `command.script` to understand why it leads to a list index out of range when the script is just `git`.
3. Implement a fix in the `git_fix_stash` rule to handle the situation when the script is solely `git` without any additional arguments.
4. Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the fix does not introduce regressions and maintains the functionality of the `git_fix_stash` rule in all scenarios.
5. Document the changes and update relevant documentation to inform users about the resolution of this bug in the `thefuck` tool.

By addressing this bug, the overall usability and reliability of the `thefuck` tool, specifically in scenarios involving the `git` command, will be significantly improved.
