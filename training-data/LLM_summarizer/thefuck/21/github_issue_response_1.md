## Summary of the GitHub Issue

The issue describes a bug where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just "git". The error manifests as an IndexError due to the list index being out of range.

The error is triggered when the `git_fix_stash` rule attempts to match a command that only contains "git" without any additional arguments. The specific traceback indicates that the failure occurs at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

This bug is hindering the proper functioning of the `git_fix_stash` rule within the `thefuck` tool, which is designed to correct user mistakes in the command line. The bug prevents the rule from executing as expected, causing potential inconvenience and inefficiency for users relying on this functionality.

The bug appears to stem from a specific condition that the `git_fix_stash` rule is not handling correctly, leading to the IndexError. Understanding and addressing this underlying condition will be crucial in resolving the issue and ensuring the proper functioning of the rule.

The comprehensive understanding of this bug will enable developers to effectively pinpoint and rectify the underlying issue, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the debugging process.
