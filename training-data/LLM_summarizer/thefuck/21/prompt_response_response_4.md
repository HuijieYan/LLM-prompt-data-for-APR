The bug in the provided function `match` is due to the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which attempts to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This leads to an IndexError when the command script is just "git" without any additional arguments.

To address this bug, we need to modify the function to first split the command script and then check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
from thefuck.shells import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command: Command) -> bool:
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison is only made if there is a second word in the script, thus avoiding any index out of range errors. With this change, the function should work correctly for the given input parameters and variable values.
