Based on the analysis of the bug and the provided information, the buggy function is failing due to an IndexError caused by attempting to access the second element of a list obtained from splitting the command script. The function is intended to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the usage message is present in the command's stderr.

The correction involves checking the length of the split script before attempting to access its elements. By ensuring that the script contains at least two elements, the IndexError can be avoided.

Here is the corrected version of the function that resolves the bug:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revision handles the potential IndexError by first checking if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This fix ensures that the function operates correctly for a wider range of input scenarios, addressing the bug identified in the `git_fix_stash` rule.
