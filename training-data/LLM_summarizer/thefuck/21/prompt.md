Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py` in the project.
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message reveals that the failed test case is `test_not_match` from the file `test_git_fix_stash.py` in the project, and the failure originates from a specific line in the `match` function.

The relevant portion of the buggy function is the `match` function itself, which is decorated with `@git_support`. The code inside the `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash', and if the keyword 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. The error message explicitly states that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` within the `match` function. This information indicates that the `command.script` does not contain at least two words, and therefore, the attempt to access the second word using `split()[1]` is causing the `IndexError`.

Looking at the test function `test_not_match`, an instance of `Command` is created with the command 'git' and the `stderr` is set to some value. Since the `match` function is being called with this `Command` instance, it's important to understand that the `command` object being passed should meet the conditions being checked inside the `match` function.

Upon examining the `match` function and the error message, it is clear that the error is due to the assumption that `command.script` contains at least two words. However, the `command.script` in the failed test case does not meet this assumption, leading to the `IndexError`.

In order to resolve this issue, the `match` function needs to be modified to handle cases where there are not enough words in `command.script`. This can be achieved by first checking that the split array has sufficient length before accessing its elements.

In summary, the root cause of the failure is the `IndexError` due to the `command.script` not having enough words. The fix involves modifying the `match` function to correctly handle cases where the split array may not contain enough elements.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Observations:
- The input parameter `command.script` is the string `'git'`.
- The input parameter `command` is an instance of the `Command` class with the `script` attribute set to `'git'`, an empty `stdout`, and `stderr` containing the usage message.
- The input parameter `command.stderr` is the string `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'`.

At the moment before the function returns, the variable `splited_script` is assigned the value `['git']` indicating that the script parameter was split into a list.

Looking at the function code, the problematic line is:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The issue:
1. The function is assuming that splitting `command.script` results in multiple elements. However, in this case, `command.script` only has one element, so accessing index 1 will result in an IndexError.

Suggested fix:
1. Check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before accessing index 1.
2. Handle cases where there may not be a valid index 1 element after splitting `command.script`.

Here's the revised code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revised code checks the length of the split script and then performs the comparison, addressing the issue observed in the buggy test case.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The given function is intended to take in a command and check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. 

However, there are several issues in the code.
1. The function is supposed to access the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object, but the original code references undefined variables `command.script` and `command.stderr`.
2. The logic is also incorrect as it will raise an error if either `script` or `stderr` is empty.

To fix these issues, we need to access the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object correctly, and also handle the case when they may be empty.

Here is the corrected function code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code correctly accesses the `script` and `stderr` attributes of the `command` object and also handles the case when the `script` is empty. It first checks if the `script` contains at least two words, and then checks the second word for 'stash'. Finally, it checks if 'usage:' is in the `stderr` attribute. This code should now satisfy the expected behavior and pass the specified test cases.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

## Summary:
The issue is related to a failure in the `git_fix_stash` rule of `thefuck` when the script is just `git`. The bug causes a `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicating that the `git_fix_stash` rule is unable to handle the situation when the script is just `git`.

This issue prevents the proper execution of the `git_fix_stash` rule, impacting the functionality and effectiveness of the `thefuck` tool in scenarios where the script is solely `git`.

The specific error is traced back to the `git_fix_stash.py` file, specifically in the `match` function, where the `split()` method is performed on the `command.script` and ultimately leads to a list index out of range.

The bug affects the core functionality of the `git_fix_stash` rule, thereby impeding the seamless usage of `thefuck` in scenarios involving the `git` command without any additional arguments.

Resolving this bug is crucial to ensure uninterrupted and efficient usage of the `thefuck` tool, especially in scenarios where the `git` command is used alone or without any arguments.

## Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate the root cause of the `IndexError` occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.
2. Analyze the behavior of the `split()` method on the `command.script` to understand why it leads to a list index out of range when the script is just `git`.
3. Implement a fix in the `git_fix_stash` rule to handle the situation when the script is solely `git` without any additional arguments.
4. Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the fix does not introduce regressions and maintains the functionality of the `git_fix_stash` rule in all scenarios.
5. Document the changes and update relevant documentation to inform users about the resolution of this bug in the `thefuck` tool.

By addressing this bug, the overall usability and reliability of the `thefuck` tool, specifically in scenarios involving the `git` command, will be significantly improved.
