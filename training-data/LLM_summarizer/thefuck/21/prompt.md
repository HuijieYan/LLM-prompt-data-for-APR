Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py` in the project.
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test function `test_not_match` is supposed to check that the `match` function does not return `True` when a specific command is executed. In this case, it is expected that when the command "git" is passed with a specific `stderr` parameter, the `match` function should return `False`. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurred in the `match` function at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, specifically at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This line attempts to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then checks whether the second element is 'stash' and whether 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

The error message provides more context by showing the actual `command` being passed to the `match` function, and it includes the `stderr` content, which is a multiline string that resembles the output of the `git stash` command.

The error is due to the `command.script.split()` failing to produce at least two elements, leading to the `IndexError`. This indicates that the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to perform the split operation and access the second element. Consequently, this highlights an issue with the `Command` object or how it is constructed.

To resolve the issue, the `Command` object and its usage need to be examined to ensure that it is being created correctly and that the `command.script` contains the expected content when used as input for the `match` function. Additionally, the logic of the `match` function might need to be adjusted to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain the expected elements.

In conclusion, the error message and the test function code provide essential information about the nature and location of the bug. They highlight the specific line causing the `IndexError` and provide the `command` object being used in the failed test case, which is crucial for diagnosing and debugging the issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Upon reviewing the provided code and the runtime values and types for the input parameters and key variables, it seems that the function is intended to check whether the command script is related to "stash" and whether the usage message is present in the command's stderr.

However, there are some issues with the current implementation. The main problem is with the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The split function on `command.script` returns a list, and accessing the element at index 1 might not always be valid. If the script is only 'git' without a subsequent word, this comparison will raise an error.

Looking at the values and types of the variables during the runtime of the buggy case 1:
- `command.script` has a value of `'git'` and type `str`.
- `command` is an instance of the `Command` class, with `script` equal to `'git'`, `stdout` empty, and `stderr` containing the usage message related to "stash".
- `command.stderr` contains the usage message related to "stash" and has a value of `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'` and type `str`.

It becomes evident that the current implementation of the function would throw an error when trying to split `command.script`. This error is likely leading to the function not working as expected. 

To fix this, the function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. The corrected code could be as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This change ensures that the comparison is only made if there is a second word in the script, thus avoiding any index out of range errors. With this correction, the function should work correctly for the given input parameters and variable values.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The match function takes an input parameter, command, and checks if the second word in the script attribute of the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr attribute of the command object. If both conditions are met, the function returns True. If either of the conditions is not met, the function returns False.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

## Summary of the GitHub Issue

The issue describes a bug where the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just "git". The error manifests as an IndexError due to the list index being out of range.

The error is triggered when the `git_fix_stash` rule attempts to match a command that only contains "git" without any additional arguments. The specific traceback indicates that the failure occurs at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

This bug is hindering the proper functioning of the `git_fix_stash` rule within the `thefuck` tool, which is designed to correct user mistakes in the command line. The bug prevents the rule from executing as expected, causing potential inconvenience and inefficiency for users relying on this functionality.

The bug appears to stem from a specific condition that the `git_fix_stash` rule is not handling correctly, leading to the IndexError. Understanding and addressing this underlying condition will be crucial in resolving the issue and ensuring the proper functioning of the rule.

The comprehensive understanding of this bug will enable developers to effectively pinpoint and rectify the underlying issue, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the debugging process.
