The revised function that resolves the bug is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This revised function includes a check for the length of the split command before attempting to access index 1, preventing a list index out of range error. The function now correctly handles the scenario where the user enters just 'git' as a command, ensuring that it returns the appropriate boolean value based on the specified conditions.
