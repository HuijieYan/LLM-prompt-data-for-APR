The buggy function attempts to split the command script and check if the second word is 'stash', which leads to an IndexError when the script is only 'git' without any subsequent word. This occurs due to the assumption that the script will always contain at least two words. 

To fix the bug, we should first check the length of the split script and then proceed with the comparison. Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By introducing the check for the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we ensure that the comparison is safe from causing an IndexError. This correction addresses the bug and allows the function to work as intended.
