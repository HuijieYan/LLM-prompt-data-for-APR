Observations:
- The input parameter `command.script` is the string `'git'`.
- The input parameter `command` is an instance of the `Command` class with the `script` attribute set to `'git'`, an empty `stdout`, and `stderr` containing the usage message.
- The input parameter `command.stderr` is the string `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'`.

At the moment before the function returns, the variable `splited_script` is assigned the value `['git']` indicating that the script parameter was split into a list.

Looking at the function code, the problematic line is:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The issue:
1. The function is assuming that splitting `command.script` results in multiple elements. However, in this case, `command.script` only has one element, so accessing index 1 will result in an IndexError.

Suggested fix:
1. Check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before accessing index 1.
2. Handle cases where there may not be a valid index 1 element after splitting `command.script`.

Here's the revised code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revised code checks the length of the split script and then performs the comparison, addressing the issue observed in the buggy test case.
