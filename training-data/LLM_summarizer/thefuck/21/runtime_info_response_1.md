The function `match` takes in a parameter `command` and specifically checks if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

From the expected case 1, we see that:
- `command.script` is 'git'
- `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage: git stash list [<options>]' and 'usage: git stash show [<stash>]' and 'usage: git stash drop [-q'

Based on this information, the expected output for the given case would be True, as it satisfies both conditions in the function.

We need to check the value of `command.script.split()[1]` and `'usage:' in command.stderr` at the time of function's return to understand why this test case is failing.

Assuming that the function is returning False for this particular test case, the possible reasons might be:
1. The value of `command.script.split()[1]` is not 'stash'
2. 'usage:' is not present in `command.stderr`

To debug this, we need to print the value of `command.script.split()[1]` and check if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr` at the time of function's return.

We can add debug prints to the code to print the values of `command.script.split()[1]` and 'usage:' in `command.stderr` and run the test case again to capture the updated values.

Once we have the updated values, we can compare them with the expected output and deduce the exact reason for the failure.

By doing this, we can pinpoint the exact condition that is not being met and make the necessary changes to fix the function.
