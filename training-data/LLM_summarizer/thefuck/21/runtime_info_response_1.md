Upon reviewing the provided code and the runtime values and types for the input parameters and key variables, it seems that the function is intended to check whether the command script is related to "stash" and whether the usage message is present in the command's stderr.

However, there are some issues with the current implementation. The main problem is with the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The split function on `command.script` returns a list, and accessing the element at index 1 might not always be valid. If the script is only 'git' without a subsequent word, this comparison will raise an error.

Looking at the values and types of the variables during the runtime of the buggy case 1:
- `command.script` has a value of `'git'` and type `str`.
- `command` is an instance of the `Command` class, with `script` equal to `'git'`, `stdout` empty, and `stderr` containing the usage message related to "stash".
- `command.stderr` contains the usage message related to "stash" and has a value of `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'` and type `str`.

It becomes evident that the current implementation of the function would throw an error when trying to split `command.script`. This error is likely leading to the function not working as expected. 

To fix this, the function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. The corrected code could be as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This change ensures that the comparison is only made if there is a second word in the script, thus avoiding any index out of range errors. With this correction, the function should work correctly for the given input parameters and variable values.
