Based on the provided information, the buggy function fails to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to perform the split operation and access the second element, leading to an IndexError. This poses a problem with the comparison `command.script.split()[1]` when the script is just "git".

To address this issue, the function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This ensures that the comparison is only made if there is a second word in the script, avoiding any index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version of the function first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. It resolves the issue of IndexError and ensures that the function works correctly for the given input parameters and variable values.

Please replace the buggy function with this corrected code to resolve the issue and ensure proper functionality.
