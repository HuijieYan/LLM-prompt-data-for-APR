The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This line attempts to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then checks whether the second element is 'stash' and whether 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

The error occurs because the `command.script` does not contain enough elements to perform the split operation and access the second element. This leads to the IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
