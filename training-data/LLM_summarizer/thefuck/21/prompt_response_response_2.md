```python
from thefuck.rules.git_fix_stash import match as git_fix_stash_match
from thefuck.shells import Command

def test_not_match():
    assert not git_fix_stash_match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```

Upon reviewing the given test function and the associated error message, it is evident that the bug lies within the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurs at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file when attempting to access the second element of the split `command.script`. 

The error occurs because the `command.script` might not contain enough elements to perform the split operation and access the second element, leading to the IndexError. This indicates an issue with the construction of the `Command` object or how it is being utilized.

To resolve the bug, the match function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function works correctly for different inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
