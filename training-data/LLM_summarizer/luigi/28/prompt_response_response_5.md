Based on the analysis of the provided function, test cases, and the GitHub issue related to the bug, it is evident that the buggy behavior is primarily related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The logic of the `table_exists` function should be adjusted to handle case insensitivity for table names. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle multi-line outputs appropriately, ensuring that it accurately determines the existence of tables and partitions based on the full content of `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

    # The rest of the class implementation...
```

In the code above:
- In the case where `partition` is None, instead of checking if the table name is in the `stdout`, the corrected approach compares the lowercase version of the table name with each line of the `stdout` after splitting it by lines. This ensures that case sensitivity is handled appropriately.
- When `partition` is not None, the function simply returns the boolean result of whether `stdout` is empty or not, avoiding issues related to multi-line outputs.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function now properly handles case insensitivity and multi-line `stdout`, addressing the reported issues.

Please integrate this corrected version of the function into the appropriate module in the project, ensuring that it effectively resolves the bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. Thorough testing should be conducted to validate the fix and ensure its compatibility with the existing codebase. If deemed appropriate, the proposed changes can then be included in a pull request to address the bug as per the GitHub issue description.
