Based on the analysis, it is evident that the issue lies in the logic of the `table_exists` function, specifically in how it handles the output of the Hive commands when checking for table or partition existence. The function's behavior is affected by case sensitivity, causing it to return incorrect values in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. Additionally, the function should correctly handle multi-line output so that it accurately determines the existence of tables and partitions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the modified code:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, the `stdout` is split into individual table names, and then a case-insensitive comparison is made to check for the existence of the table.
- For the case where `partition` is provided, the function simply checks if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating the existence of partitions.

This revised function should correctly handle table and partition existence checks, taking into account case insensitivity and multi-line output from the Hive commands. The corrected logic should address the bug and align with the expected behavior specified by the test cases.

Once the function is updated, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness and reliability in determining the existence of tables and partitions.

This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue related to case sensitivity and incorrect return values.
