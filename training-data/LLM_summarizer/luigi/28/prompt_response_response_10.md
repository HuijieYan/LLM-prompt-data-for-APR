Based on the analysis of the test cases, error messages, runtime variables, and expected parameters and return values, it is evident that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable, leading to erroneous evaluations and return values. Specifically, the function fails to handle multi-line outputs and does not account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To address this bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Revise the conditional checks to handle multi-line outputs appropriately and update the logic to accurately determine the existence of tables or partitions based on the full content of the `stdout`. This will ensure that the function does not make incorrect evaluations based on partial content of the output.
2. Implement case insensitivity by comparing the lowercase versions of the table name or partition with the lowercase `stdout`. This will ensure that the function handles table names with different cases in a consistent manner, as suggested in the GitHub issue related to this bug.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function along with the necessary modifications to address the identified issues:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            if stdout:
                return table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected code:
1. For the case of no partition, the function now runs the Hive command `use {database}; show tables;` to obtain the list of tables. It then checks if the lowercase version of the input `table` is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout` obtained from the command. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table.
2. For the case of a specified partition, the function uses the `show partitions` Hive command to obtain the partitions for the specified table and database, as before. The logic for handling the `stdout` in this case remains unchanged.

By implementing these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function resolves the identified issues related to case sensitivity and incorrect evaluations, and it aligns with the proposed solution for the bug as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, addressing the identified bug and restoring the expected behavior of the method.
