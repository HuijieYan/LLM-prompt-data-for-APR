From the provided buggy function code, it seems that there are a couple of issues that could be causing the test function `test_apacheclient_table_exists` to fail:

1. The conditional check in the buggy `table_exists` function is not correctly evaluating the result of the partition check, especially when `partition` is not `None`.
2. There may be a problem with case sensitivity when checking for table existence.

For the first issue, we'll focus on the part of the `table_exists` function that handles the `partition` case. It appears that the conditional check related to `partition` is not properly evaluating the command's output to determine if the table exists or not.

```python
if partition is None:
    # ...
else:
    stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    # ...
```

The key point here is to understand why the condition where `partition is not None` would return `False` even when a valid table exists. We need to carefully examine this conditional logic to identify any potential logic errors or inconsistencies.

The second issue points to possible case sensitivity issues. Therefore, we should analyze the code related to case sensitivity checks in the test function as well as the `table_exists` function to ensure consistency in handling table names.

Looking at the error message, it's clear that the failure occurred in the test function `test_apacheclient_table_exists`:

```
E       AssertionError: False is not true
```

This assertion error indicates that the expected result was `True`, but the actual result was `False`. This could be due to either the partition logic or the case sensitivity issue mentioned earlier.

To address these problems, it is important to carefully review the conditional checks and logic in the `table_exists` function, especially focusing on the `partition` handling and case sensitivity concerns. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function for any other potential issues.

By meticulously examining these sections of code and thoroughly understanding the error messages, we can systematically diagnose and resolve the errors within the buggy function.
