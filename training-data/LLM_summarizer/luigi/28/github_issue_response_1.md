Summary:
The issue is related to the case sensitivity of the table_exists function in the luigi package's hive module. When checking for the existence of tables, the function is case sensitive, causing tests to fail when tables are defined with capitalized names but returned as lower case by Hive. This issue did not exist in older versions of the package, which checked for specific strings in the stdout. The proposed solution is to make the table_exists function case insensitive by comparing the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name. The contributor is willing to supply a pull request to fix the issue.

Insights:
1. The issue is specific to the case sensitivity of table names when using the table_exists function.
2. The proposed solution involves checking the lowercase version of the table name against the stdout to avoid case sensitivity issues.
3. The contributor is willing to provide a pull request to address the bug.

Impact:
The bug impacts the reliability of table existence checks when dealing with tables with capitalized names. It affects the efficiency of testing and can lead to failed tests due to case sensitivity issues.

Action:
Review the proposed solution and consider the pull request to make the table_exists function case insensitive. Test the fix thoroughly to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing new bugs.
