The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the case sensitivity of table name comparisons, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

The root cause of the issue lies in the comparison logic within the `table_exists` function. The function's logic for determining the existence of a table is not robust and does not account for different cases, especially for partitioned tables where the presence of partitions is mistakenly used as an indicator of the table's existence. Additionally, the function uses case-sensitive comparisons, which results in incorrect results when dealing with table names that differ only in case.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to handle cases for both non-partitioned and partitioned tables. For non-partitioned tables, the function should explicitly check for the presence of the table name in the "stdout" output while also allowing for case-insensitive comparisons. For partitioned tables, it should check for the presence of specific partitions corresponding to the "partition" parameter in addition to the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
        return any(t.lower() == table_lower for t in stdout.split())  # Check for table existence using case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

In the corrected code:
1. For non-partitioned tables, the function retrieves the list of tables using `show tables` and then performs a case-insensitive comparison to check for the existence of the specified table name.
2. For partitioned tables, the function checks for the presence of specific partitions corresponding to the "partition" parameter as before, with no change in logic for this scenario.

This corrected code addresses the case sensitivity issue and provides a more reliable way of determining whether a table exists in the specified database, thereby resolving the bug.
