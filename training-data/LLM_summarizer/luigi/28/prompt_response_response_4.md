Based on the analysis, it is evident that the bug in the table_exists function is causing incorrect return values, particularly in scenarios where the stdout contains multi-line output. Additionally, the function fails the test case involving case insensitivity of table names, indicating an issue with how the function handles string comparisons.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. When checking for table existence, convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
2. For partition existence checks, handle multi-line outputs appropriately to accurately determine the existence of partitions.
3. Update the function's logic to ensure that it correctly identifies the presence of tables or partitions based on the complete content of the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. For the table existence check, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
2. For partition existence, the function simply checks if the stdout is empty, indicating the absence of partitions.

These changes ensure that the table existence check is case-insensitive, and the function correctly handles both single-line and multi-line outputs to determine the existence of tables and partitions. This revised function can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
