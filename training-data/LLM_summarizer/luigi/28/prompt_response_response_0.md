Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided information, it is clear that the function `table_exists` has issues with determining the existence of tables, especially when dealing with case sensitivity and partitioned tables. The problematic portions of the function include the conditional checks based on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, leading to incorrect results and failed test cases. Additionally, the function does not account for case insensitivity when comparing table names, which further exacerbates the issue.

To resolve the bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Modify the code to handle case insensitivity when comparing table names in the `stdout` variable.
2. Refactor the conditional checks to ensure that the function accurately determines the existence of tables, especially in partitioned scenarios.

Based on these considerations, the revised version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    lowercase_table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case insensitivity
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return lowercase_table in stdout.lower()  # Check for table existence case insensitively
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

In this revised version, the function now converts the table name to lowercase for case insensitivity and uses the `in` operator to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, the conditional checks have been simplified to focus on the presence of non-empty `stdout` for partitioned tables.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should accurately determine the existence of tables and address the identified bugs. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issues related to case sensitivity and partitioned table checking.
