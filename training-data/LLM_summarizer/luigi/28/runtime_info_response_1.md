The `table_exists` function seems to be a method of a class, as seen in the variable logs that have `self` as one of the input parameters. The purpose of the function is to return a boolean value based on whether a table or partition exists in the database. 

Looking at the function code, we can see that the function checks if `partition` is `None` and then performs operations accordingly. Let's break down the faulty logic based on the input and output data.

### Buggy case 1 
- In this test case, the `stdout` variable has the value `'OK'`. 
- According to the code, it seems that the function is using the Hive command to show tables like `{table}` in the specified database. The code then returns whether the `table` is in the output.
- The code execution seems correct for this test case as the value `table in stdout` would return `True` if `table` is in `stdout`. 

### Buggy case 2 
- In this test case, the `stdout` variable has the value `'OK\nmytable'`. 
- This seems to be incorrect because in this case, the function logic would always return `True` for the given input parameters since the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` would evaluate to `True` due to the truthy value of `stdout`.
- It's possible that the function is not handling multi-line output as expected, causing the incorrect return value.

### Buggy case 3 
- In this test case, the function is dealing with a partition check since `partition` parameter is not `None`.
- The `stdout` variable contains the value `'day=2013-06-28/hour=3\nday=2013-06-28/hour=4\nday=2013-07-07/hour=2\n'`.
- The function should return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, which is correct based on the code. So, the function logic seems to be correct in this case.

### Buggy case 4 
- This test case is similar to Buggy case 1, with a different type of `self` parameter.
- The `stdout` variable has the value `'OK'`, and the function logic should correctly return `True` based on the code.

### Buggy case 5 
- This test case is similar to Buggy case 2, with a different type of `self` parameter.
- The `stdout` variable has the value `'OK\nmytable'`. As mentioned earlier, this case will always return `True` due to the truthy value of `stdout`, which seems incorrect based on the input parameters.

### Buggy case 6 
- This test case is similar to Buggy case 3, with a different type of `self` parameter.
- The `stdout` variable contains the value `'day=2013-06-28/hour=3\nday=2013-06-28/hour=4\nday=2013-07-07/hour=2\n'`, and according to the code, the function should return `True` which appears to be correct.

Upon examining the cases, it appears that the issue lies in how the function handles the `stdout` variable, particularly when it contains multiple lines of output. It seems that the function does not discriminate between different lines of output when determining whether a table or partition exists based on the command's response.

To fix this issue, the function should parse the `stdout` for both cases (table existence and partition existence) appropriately by considering each line separately. An adjustment to the logic is required to accurately reflect the existence of the table or partition based on the full content of `stdout`.

Additional care should be taken to ensure that the function correctly handles the output in all possible scenarios, including multi-line outputs and edge cases.
