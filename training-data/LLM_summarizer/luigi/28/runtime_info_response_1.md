Based on the provided function code and the expected input and output variable values, let's break down each test case to identify the potential issues:

### Test Case 1:
#### Input:
- database: `'default'`
- table: `'mytable'`
- self: `<luigi.contrib.hive.HiveCommandClient object at 0x10efed370>`

#### Expected stdout:
- `'OK'`

#### Analysis:
In the first test case, the function should execute the `show tables like` command in the specified database and check if the table exists in the output. The expected stdout is `'OK'`. However, the function may not be returning the expected value. It's important to note that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not provided in the source code, so its behavior and return values are unknown.

### Test Case 2:
#### Input:
- database: `'default'`
- table: `'MyTable'`
- self: `<luigi.contrib.hive.HiveCommandClient object at 0x10efed370>`

#### Expected stdout:
- `'OK\nmytable'`

#### Analysis:
Similar to test case 1, this test aims to verify the existence of the `'MyTable'` in the specified database. The expected stdout is `'OK\nmytable'`, indicating that the table exists. However, the function might not be returning the correct value based on the command execution and output.

### Test Case 3:
#### Input:
- database: `'default'`
- table: `'mytable'`
- self: `<luigi.contrib.hive.ApacheHiveCommandClient object at 0x10e7eb520>`

#### Expected stdout:
- `'OK'`

#### Analysis:
In this case, the function is called with a different type of `self` object, specifically an `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object. The expected output is `'OK'`, suggesting that the table should exist in the specified database. However, if the function is unable to handle the different type of `self` object, it may not return the expected value.

### Test Case 4:
#### Input:
- database: `'default'`
- table: `'MyTable'`
- self: `<luigi.contrib.hive.ApacheHiveCommandClient object at 0x10e7eb520>`

#### Expected stdout:
- `'OK\nmytable'`

#### Analysis:
Similar to test case 3, this test case involves the `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object as `self`. The expected stdout is `'OK\nmytable'`, indicating that the table exists. However, if the function is not handling the different `self` object correctly, it may not return the expected value.

### Possible Issues:
1. The function may not be handling different types of `self` objects (`HiveCommandClient` vs. `ApacheHiveCommandClient`) correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function behavior and its output processing are critical for determining the existence of the table, and any issues within it could lead to incorrect function returns.

To address the issues mentioned above, it's crucial to investigate how the `run_hive_cmd` function is implemented and ensure that the function can handle different types of `self` objects appropriately. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the command generation and execution in the `table_exists` function to align with the expected behavior. Finally, thorough testing with different input values and types of `self` objects is essential to validate the function's correctness and identify any potential edge cases.
