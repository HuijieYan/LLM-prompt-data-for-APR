Based on the analysis of the test cases and the observed errors, the bug in the `table_exists` function is primarily related to its case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables. The function needs to be made case insensitive to accurately determine the existence of tables with different case representations.

To fix the bug:
1. The `table_exists` function should be modified to handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output.
2. The `stdout` should be converted to lowercase for comparison to ensure that case sensitivity does not affect the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the revised version, the output `stdout` is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and the table name is also converted to lowercase for comparison. This ensures that the function is now case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table.

This corrected code addresses the bug by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report and aligning the function's behavior with the expected results in the test cases. This revised function can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
