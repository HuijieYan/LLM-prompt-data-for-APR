Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function seems to stem from the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, the function's logic for determining the existence of a table in partitioned databases is not robust. To address these issues, the following corrective measures can be taken:

1. Update the comparison logic to be case insensitive, allowing the function to accurately identify the existence of tables regardless of the letter case.
2. Separate the handling of non-partitioned and partitioned tables, ensuring that the function appropriately checks for the presence of the table and its partitions.

Taking into account the suggested approaches, a revised version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... other methods ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".
                                  format(database, table, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty

    # ... other methods ...
```

In this revised version:
- The comparison logic has been simplified to check for the existence of the table or its partitions by directly evaluating the truthiness of the `stdout` output.
- The underlying checks for the existence of the table and its partitions have been adjusted to provide accurate and reliable results.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should correctly identify the existence of tables and their corresponding partitions, addressing the issues observed in the buggy function.
