Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from its incorrect evaluation of the output `stdout` when checking for the existence of a table. The issue specifically involves case sensitivity, which causes tests to fail when tables are defined with capitalized names but returned as lower case by Hive. This bug impacts the reliability of table existence checks, leading to failed tests and inefficiency in testing.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle case sensitivity correctly. When checking for the existence of a table, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output `stdout` to avoid case sensitivity issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the bug and makes it case insensitive:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the revised function, the comparison of table names and `stdout` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.

This fix ensures that the `table_exists` function behaves as intended and addresses the case sensitivity issue identified in the GitHub issue. The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, resolving the bug and improving the reliability of table existence checks.
