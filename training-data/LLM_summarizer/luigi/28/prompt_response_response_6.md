Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function stems from its case-sensitive comparison of table names within the `stdout` output. It fails to account for variations in capitalization, leading to incorrect results and failed test cases.

To address this issue, the function must be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table within the `stdout` output.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())  # Case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

In this corrected version:
- For non-partitioned tables, the `stdout` output is split into individual table names, and a case-insensitive comparison is performed to check if the specified table exists within the list of tables.
- For partitioned tables, the function simply checks for the presence of output in the `stdout`, as the partition details are not directly related to the existence of the table.

By implementing these adjustments, the `table_exists` function now conducts case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence, ensuring more accurate and reliable results.

Please replace the buggy `table_exists` function with the corrected version provided above to resolve the identified bug.
