Based on the analysis and the provided information, it's evident that the bug in the `table_exists` function is primarily due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables. The function does not handle case insensitivity as required, leading to failed tests when expecting case-insensitive table existence checks.

To fix the bug, the function's logic should be adjusted to perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence. Additionally, the condition for checking the existence of the table based on `stdout` should be refined to accurately evaluate the presence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected and updated version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Using case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return stdout.strip() != ""

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the corrected function:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, the comparison of `stdout` and the table name is made case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function uses `strip` to check if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating the existence of partitions.

By making these adjustments, the function now properly handles case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables and partitions, addressing the bug identified in the test cases. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
