Based on the analysis of the test cases, error messages, runtime variables, expected parameters, return values, and the GitHub issue related to the bug, the following steps should be taken to address the bug in the `table_exists` function:

1. The test cases reveal that the `table_exists` function fails to accurately determine the existence of tables, especially when dealing with case-insensitive table names and partitioned tables.

2. The potential error location within the function lies in the conditional checks that determine the return value based on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable. The function does not handle case insensitivity and does not account for the presence of specific table or partition names within the `stdout` output.

3. The bug occurs due to the function's reliance on the truthiness of `stdout` and the neglect of case insensitivity when checking for table or partition names.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle case insensitivity when comparing table names and to account for the existence of specific partitions for partitioned tables.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        table_exists = any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        return table_exists
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- For non-partitioned tables, the `show tables` query is executed, and the presence of the table is checked by comparing the lowercase version of table names in the `stdout` output.
- For partitioned tables, the `show partitions` query is executed with the specific partition filter defined by the `partition` parameter, and the function checks the truthiness of the `stdout`.

By implementing these adjustments, the `table_exists` function should correctly determine the existence of tables, accounting for case insensitivity and partition specifications. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
