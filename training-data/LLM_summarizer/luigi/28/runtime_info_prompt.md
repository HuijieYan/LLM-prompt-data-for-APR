You're provided with the source code of a function that's not working as expected, along with the values of variables captured during its execution. Imagine you're in the middle of debugging, where you've got logs of both the input and output variables' values. These logs come from test cases that didn't pass, showing the types and values of the input parameters as well as the values and types of key variables at the moment the function returns. If an input parameter's value isn't mentioned in the output, you can assume it stayed the same throughout the function's execution. However, be aware that some of these output values may be incorrect.

Your mission is to dive deep into these details, linking the observed variable values with the function's code to pinpoint why these tests are failing. By closely examining and referencing specific parts of the buggy code and the variable logs, you'll need to piece together a clear, detailed narrative. This analysis is key to understanding what's going wrong and how to fix it.

We're looking for a thorough and insightful exploration. This process will aid in developing a more effective and informed approach to debugging.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
database, value: `'default'`, type: `str`

table, value: `'mytable'`, type: `str`

self, value: `<luigi.contrib.hive.HiveCommandClient object at 0x10efed370>`, type: `HiveCommandClient`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
stdout, expected value: `'OK'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 2
### Input parameter value and type
database, value: `'default'`, type: `str`

table, value: `'MyTable'`, type: `str`

self, value: `<luigi.contrib.hive.HiveCommandClient object at 0x10efed370>`, type: `HiveCommandClient`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
stdout, expected value: `'OK\nmytable'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 3
### Input parameter value and type
database, value: `'default'`, type: `str`

table, value: `'mytable'`, type: `str`

self, value: `<luigi.contrib.hive.ApacheHiveCommandClient object at 0x10e7eb520>`, type: `ApacheHiveCommandClient`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
stdout, expected value: `'OK'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 4
### Input parameter value and type
database, value: `'default'`, type: `str`

table, value: `'MyTable'`, type: `str`

self, value: `<luigi.contrib.hive.ApacheHiveCommandClient object at 0x10e7eb520>`, type: `ApacheHiveCommandClient`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
stdout, expected value: `'OK\nmytable'`, type: `str`
