Based on the analysis, the bug is located in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The method incorrectly returns `True` for case insensitive table name checks, leading to failed test cases.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` output. As a result, when the table name does not match the case of the `stdout` output, the method incorrectly returns `True`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase or uppercase and then comparing them.

Below is the corrected code for the `table_exists` method that addresses the bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of table names in the `stdout` output is performed in a case-insensitive manner using `lower()` to convert both strings to lowercase for comparison.

This corrected code ensures that the `table_exists` method handles case insensitivity for table name checks, resolving the bug identified in the test cases. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
