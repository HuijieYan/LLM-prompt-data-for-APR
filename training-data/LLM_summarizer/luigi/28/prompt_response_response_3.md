Based on the analysis of the provided information, the main issue with the `table_exists` method is its reliance on the truthiness of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of a table. Additionally, the function does not handle case sensitivity issues properly, leading to incorrect results when checking for the existence of tables with capitalized names.

To address this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to handle case insensitivity and explicitly check for the presence of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the revised version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the revised table_exists function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This revised version addresses the bug by performing a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output. In the case where `partition` is provided, the function checks for the presence of partitions in the output.

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine the existence of a table, including cases where the table name's letter case may vary. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
