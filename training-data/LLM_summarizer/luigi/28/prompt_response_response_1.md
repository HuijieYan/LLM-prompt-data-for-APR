Based on the analysis and insights provided, the buggy function `table_exists` needs to be fixed to address the case sensitivity issue and improve the reliability of table existence checking, especially for tables with capitalized names and partitioned tables.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the identified issues:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this fixed version, the `table_exists` function has been modified to address the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. 

For non-partitioned tables, the function runs a query to show all tables in the database and compares the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of each table in the `stdout` using a generator expression and the `any` function.

For partitioned tables, the function checks for the presence of partitions in the stdout and returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

This approach ensures that the `table_exists` function correctly identifies the existence of tables, regardless of the letter case used and provides consistent and reliable results. 

This corrected code can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function, resolving the identified issues and improving the overall functionality of the `table_exists` method.
