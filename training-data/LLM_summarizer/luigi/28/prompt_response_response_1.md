Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the related information, it is evident that the bug in the `table_exists` function is primarily related to the incorrect evaluation of the output (`stdout`) from Hive commands. The function is returning `True` in cases where it should return `False`, particularly when dealing with multi-line outputs or when performing case-insensitive checks for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function's logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the output from Hive commands and to perform case-insensitive comparisons, if required.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

In the corrected version:
1. For the case where `partition` is `None`, the function runs a Hive command to show all tables in the specified database and then checks if the lowercase version of the input table name exists in the output. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

2. For the case where `partition` is provided, the function runs a Hive command to show the partitions for the specified table and database, and then returns `True` if the output is non-empty, indicating that partitions exist.

This correction addresses the bug by handling the output from Hive commands appropriately and making the table existence check case-insensitive, as required.

Please integrate this corrected function into the existing codebase to resolve the bug related to table existence checks in the luigi package's hive module.
