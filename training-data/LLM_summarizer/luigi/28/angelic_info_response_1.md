Based on the provided function code and expected return values for different test cases, it is clear that the function `table_exists` is designed to check for the existence of a table in a specific database using Hive commands.

The function takes three input parameters: `table`, `database`, and `partition`. If `partition` is not provided (i.e., it is None), the function runs a Hive command to show the tables in the specified database that match the input table name. If `partition` is provided, the function shows the partitions for the specified table and database using the `show partitions` Hive command.

The function then captures the output of the Hive command (referred to as `stdout`) and checks for the existence of the table or partitions based on the received output. If the command execution is successful and the table (in the case of no partition) or partitions (in the case of a partition) are found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

In summary, the core logic of the function involves running Hive commands to show tables or partitions based on the input parameters, capturing the output of these commands, and returning `True` if the table or partitions exist and `False` if they do not.

It is also worth noting that the function relies on an external function (not provided) called `run_hive_cmd` to execute the Hive commands and capture their outputs.

The different test cases provided include different combinations of input parameters and their expected outputs, which help in understanding the behavior of the function under various scenarios.
