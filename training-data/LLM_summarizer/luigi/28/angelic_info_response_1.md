Upon initial inspection of the `table_exists` function, it seems to have a conditional check to determine whether to run a particular query based on whether the `partition` parameter is provided. If `partition` is None, it executes a `show tables` query; otherwise, it executes a `show partitions` query using the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issues related to the failed test cases can be identified by examining the behavior of the function in each scenario.

### Analysis of Expected Case 1
In this case, the `table_exists` function is expected to use the database 'default' and then execute the query 'show tables like "mytable"'. The expected output value of `stdout` is 'OK'.

Potential issue:
- The function returns `stdout and table in stdout`. This means that the function will return `True` only if `stdout` is not an empty string and `table` is within the `stdout` string.
- The expected output 'OK' does not directly indicate that the table name 'mytable' is present in the `stdout` string. Therefore, the function may not return the expected value.

### Analysis of Expected Case 2
Similar to Case 1, this case also uses the database 'default' and table 'MyTable'. The expected output value of `stdout` is 'OK\nmytable'.

Potential issue:
- As mentioned in Case 1, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly evaluate if 'MyTable' is in the `stdout` string.
- The expected `stdout` value 'OK\nmytable' might not match the actual output due to the condition checking.

### Analysis of Expected Case 3
In this case, the `table_exists` function is expected to use the database 'default' and then execute the query 'show tables like "mytable"'. The expected output value of `stdout` is 'OK'.

Potential issue:
- Similar to the issues in Case 1, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly evaluate if 'mytable' is in the `stdout` string.

### Analysis of Expected Case 4
Similar to Case 3, this case also uses the database 'default' and table 'MyTable'. The expected output value of `stdout` is 'OK\nmytable'.

Potential issue:
- Similar to the issues in Case 2, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly evaluate if 'MyTable' is in the `stdout` string.

### Proposed Code Adjustment
To address the issues identified in the analysis, the code segment `return stdout and table in stdout` should be modified to directly check if the exact table name exists in the `stdout` string. Alternatively, it can be adjusted to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of the specific contents of `stdout`.

Here's a proposed adjustment to the code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

In summary, the proposed adjustment simplifies the return logic to focus solely on the presence of a non-empty `stdout` rather than specific string content. This should align better with the expected behavior in the provided test cases.
