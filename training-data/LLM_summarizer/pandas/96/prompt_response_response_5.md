Based on the provided analysis and the given function, the potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the conditional logic related to adjustments by business days and remaining business hours. The calculations for `bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` variables seem to be producing unexpected results, leading to the function's failure in multiple test cases.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug may include incorrect conditional logic and inaccurate calculations within the function. The business day adjustments and remaining business hour calculations might not be accurately reflecting the intended behavior, leading to discrepancies in the output results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing and revising the conditional logic related to adjustments by business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensuring that the calculations for `bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` are aligned with the expected behavior based on the input parameters.
3. Conducting thorough testing with various input scenarios to validate the corrected function.

Here is the revised version of the function that addresses the identified issues and incorporates the suggested approaches:

```python

    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the revised function may need additional testing and validation to ensure its correctness.
