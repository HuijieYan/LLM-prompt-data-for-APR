The test functions are located in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file. The specific test function that resulted in a failure is named `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. This test function creates a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, sets the starting time to "15:00", and the holiday to "2020-11-26". It then creates a date range starting from "2020-11-25 15:00" and generates 4 periods with the created frequency. The resulting date range is then compared against the expected date range to check for equality using `tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)`.

The error message indicates an issue related to frequency validation. The `_validate_frequency` method is called with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, and it throws a `ValueError` due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The failing test function and the associated error message provide valuable information about the issue. The error occurred while attempting to create a `DatetimeIndex` with a specific frequency, and the failure is attributed to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This information points to a problem within the logic for deriving and applying frequencies or time ranges, specifically when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

To diagnose and resolve the problem, the `apply` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class needs to be carefully examined and tested to understand its behavior when applied to different types of dates and times. The workaround might include debugging the calculation of business hours and business days, adjustments, and comparisons in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class to ensure that the correct frequencies and time spans are identified and applied accurately.

Understanding the usage of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and its correct application is critically important for debugging the failure identified in the test and error message. By dissecting the relevant parts of the `apply` function and considering the implications of the failure and error message, a targeted analysis and debugging effort can be initiated to correct the underlying issue.
