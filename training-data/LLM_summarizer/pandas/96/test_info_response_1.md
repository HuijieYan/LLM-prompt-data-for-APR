From the provided information, it's evident that there is a bug in the implementation of the `apply` function. It seems that the error message is directly related to the faulty behavior of the `apply` function. Also, the corresponding test function, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, provides specific input and expected output related to the bug. By analyzing the functioning of the `apply` function together with the error message, more insights can be derived to understand and troubleshoot the problem comprehensively.

Test Function:
The `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test function validates the functionality of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in its output when used with the `pd.date_range` function. The expected result after calling `pd.date_range` is compared against the actual result using `tm.assert_index_equal`.

Specifically, the test uses the `CustomBusinessHour` to define a custom business hour frequency (e.g., start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"]), and then uses `pd.date_range` to generate a date range. The expected result asserts that the date range generated should conform to the specified frequency, with specific business hours and consideration for holidays.

Error Message:
The error message appears to be a failure in the validation of a frequency against a Datetime Array/Index or Timedelta Array/Index. The stack trace shows that an issue arises in a method `_validate_frequency` within the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message provided details about the frequencies and inferred frequencies but primarily points to an inconsistency or discrepancy related to the specified frequency "CBH".

Analysis of Defective Functionality:
The primary faulty behavior in the `apply` function is due to the interpretation of the frequency and how it is subsequently validated. A further inspection of the `apply` function shows that the logic of adjusting business hours within the date and time object potentially conflicts with the definition and adherence to a specific frequency. This could lead to the discrepancy encountered during frequency validation.

The error message traces back to the validation of frequency, and the raised `ValueError` within the `_validate_frequency` is consistent with this conflict. It is evident that the `apply` method, when dealing with custom business hours and holidays, appears to be miscalculating or incorrectly adjusting the business hours within the given frequency. This inconsistency is further supported by the fact that the given frequency, "CBH", seems to be incompatible or unaligned with the inferred frequency from the passed values.

Temporally Speaking:
It looks like the bug surfaces when business hours interact with the precise timing of the holidays and the handling of business hours on different days. The adjust and replace operations seem to disrupt the expected frequency intervals, potentially causing the misalignment detected during the frequency validation process.

Conclusion:
In summary, the embodiment of the `apply` function appears to be flawed in handling business hours, especially when specifying custom business hours and holidays. This leads to an inconsistency in a given frequency and its alignment with the actual frequency inferred from the passed values. Solving the bug would require revisiting the adjustment and replacement of business hours, ensuring that it aligns with the defined frequency, and comparing that the generated date range adheres to the expected frequency. By resolving this behavior within the `apply` function, the error should be effectively resolved.
