The `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function calls the `pd.date_range` method to create a sequence of dates using a custom business hour frequency. However, the error message indicates that there is a failure in validating the frequency, leading to a `ValueError` being raised.

The specific test function code doesn't seem to contain an issue, as it simply calls the `pd.date_range` method to produce a result which aligns with the expected values.

Upon analyzing the `ValueError` raised, it is apparent that the failure is related to frequency validation. Given that the error message highlights that "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH", it appears that the issue might be within the frequency validation logic in the `pd.date_range` function or one of the related parent classes.

The `pd.date_range` method utilizes the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, which has also been specified in the error message.

Following the error message traceback, we see that the issue is within the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. It seems that the `inferred` frequency is `None`, and this is causing the `ValueError` to be raised when the inferred frequency doesn't conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

In conclusion, the root cause of the error is related to frequency validation, specifically within the `_validate_frequency` method. Further investigation into the implementation of the frequency validation logic is required in order to diagnose and resolve the error.
