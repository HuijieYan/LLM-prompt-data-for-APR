Summary:
The bug described results in unexpected behavior when using the `pd.date_range` function in Pandas. Specifically, when the `pd.date_range` function is used with periods and a custom business hour frequency that includes a holiday, it produces more than the specified number of periods. This issue is demonstrated with the provided code snippet, where the presence of a holiday leads to an output with more periods than expected.

The user notes that when they replace the `periods` parameter with the corresponding end date, the `pd.date_range` function works as expected. However, the observed behavior with the `periods` parameter and holidays remains problematic and unexpected.

The user seeks assistance in understanding why the `pd.date_range` function exhibits this unexpected behavior when holidays are included. By addressing this issue, it would enhance the reliability and accuracy of the `pd.date_range` function in scenarios involving custom business hours and holidays.

Ultimately, rectifying this bug would contribute to the overall robustness and functionality of the Pandas library, ensuring that the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function aligns with user expectations and requirements.
