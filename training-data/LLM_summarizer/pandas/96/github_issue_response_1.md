Summary:
The issue reports a specific problem with using the `pd.date_range` function in Pandas. When attempting to generate a date range with a specified start time, a number of periods, and a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays, the output unexpectedly produces more than the specified number of periods.

The user provides two examples to illustrate the issue: one without holidays, which works as expected, and another with holidays, which results in more periods than specified. The user then mentions that replacing the `periods` parameter with the corresponding end date produces the desired result, indicating that the issue specifically relates to the use of `periods`.

The user expresses uncertainty about the cause of this unexpected behavior and requests assistance in understanding and resolving the issue with the `pd.date_range` function.

In conclusion, the issue relates to the inconsistency in the `pd.date_range` function's behavior when using the `periods` parameter and adding holidays, leading to more periods than expected. Addressing this issue will require a comprehensive examination of the function's handling of holidays and periods to ensure the generation of accurate date ranges.
