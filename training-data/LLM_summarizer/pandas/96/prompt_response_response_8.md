Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the runtime variables, it seems that the main issues arise from the way the adjustments are made to the `other` timestamp based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The adjustments and comparisons in the function do not seem to handle all scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect output values. Additionally, the conditional checks and adjustments related to the value of `n` might not be working as intended, especially when `n` is positive or negative.

To address the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Review the business hour logic to ensure that comparisons and adjustments are made correctly according to the specified business hours.
2. Pay close attention to the conditional checks and adjustments related to the value of `n` to ensure accurate adjustments to the `other` timestamp.
3. Implement additional logging or debug statements to review the conditional checks being used for the adjustment logic to identify specific scenarios where the adjustments are not working as expected.
4. Test the function with various input timestamps and values of `n` to cover a wide range of scenarios.
5. Refactor the adjustment logic to comprehensively handle all scenarios, including positive and negative values of `n`.

Here is the revised version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = min(self._get_closing_time(next_open) - other, bhour_remain)
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = next_open
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = min(next_open - other, bhour_remain)
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(next_open - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised function addresses the issues identified and should provide the expected behavior when used in conjunction with the `pd.date_range` function.
