Based on the runtime variables and the provided test case, there seem to be potential issues with the calculations in the `apply` function. Here are the identified problems and the potential approaches for fixing them:

### Identified Issues:
1. Inconsistent values for the `bd`, `bhour_remain`, and `bhour` variables in multiple test cases.
2. Unexpected behavior in the conditional logic related to adjustments by business days and remaining business hours.

### Potential Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and refactor the conditional logic for adjustments by business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate calculations.
2. Validate the handling of input parameters and their influence on the internal calculations.
3. Conduct additional test cases to verify the correctness of the fixed function.

### Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):

                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )

                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:

                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0

        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the identified issues by improving the conditional logic for adjustments by business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, it aims to ensure accurate calculations and proper handling of input parameters. Further testing is recommended to validate the functionality of the corrected function.
