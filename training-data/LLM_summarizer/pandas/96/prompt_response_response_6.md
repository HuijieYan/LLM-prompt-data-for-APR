Based on the analysis of the test case and error message, it appears that the issue is related to the logic within the `apply` function itself. The function contains multiple conditional branches that handle adjustments for business days and business hours, which seem to be producing unexpected results.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the inaccurate calculations in the function, particularly related to the adjustment by business days (`bd` variable), remaining business hours (`bhour_remain` variable), and business hours interval (`bhour` variable).

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to review and refactor the conditional logic within the function, especially the sections responsible for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, validating the calculations and ensuring they align with the expected behavior is crucial.

Here is the corrected and revised version of the `apply` function, addressing the bug by refactoring the conditional logic and adjusting the business days and remaining business hours calculations:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The revised `apply` function includes modified conditional logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure more accurate calculations and proper handling of edge cases. This revised version aims to address the bug while aligning the function's behavior with the expected outcomes.
