Upon reviewing the test function `test_comment_in_decorator` in `tests/test_black.py`, the error message located at line 633 asserts that the `assertFormatEqual` method failed. Specifically, the call to `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)` results in an `AssertionError` because the expected and actual outputs do not match.

Comparing the expected and actual outputs, the error message highlights the differences between the two outputs: 
- The expected output is: `@pro[13 chars]: X\n@property\n# TODO: Y\n# TODO: Z\n@propert[21 chars]ss\n`
- The actual output is: `@pro[13 chars]: X\n\n\n@property\n# TODO: Y\n# TODO: Z\n\n\n[29 chars]ss\n`

The differences between the two outputs are particularly found in the formatting of comments and newlines. The expected output contains certain comments and additional newlines that are not present in the actual output, which results in the assertion failure.

From this, it can be inferred that there is an issue with the implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, as it is responsible for adding or removing newlines based on certain conditions. Specifically, the discrepancies in formatting between the expected and actual outputs indicate that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may not be handling newlines or comments correctly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

In order to diagnose and resolve the errors within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, further examination and debugging of the relevant parts of the function - particularly those related to handling comments and newlines - is necessary. By pinpointing the specific conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that are responsible for the formatting differences, a more accurate diagnosis and resolution of the bugs can be achieved.
