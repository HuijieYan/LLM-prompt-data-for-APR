Summary:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `Line` object and returns a tuple of two integers. It begins by setting `max_allowed` to 1 and then potentially updates it to 2 based on the `depth` property of the `current_line`. Next, it processes the `leaves` property of the `current_line` and adjusts the `before` variable accordingly. Then, it checks various conditions related to the type of the current line (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`) as well as the relationship with the `previous_line` and updates the return values accordingly. Additionally, it manipulates the `self.previous_defs` list based on the `depth` property and updates it under certain conditions. The analysis of the expected variable values and types before function return across different test cases provides valuable insights into the function's behavior and logic, shedding light on its potential issues and discrepancies.
