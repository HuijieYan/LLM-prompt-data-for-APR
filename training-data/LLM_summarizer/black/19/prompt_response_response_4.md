In the provided corrected version of the function, the issues with incorrect newline calculations and conditions related to decorators, imports, and yield are addressed. The logic for adjusting `before` and `newlines` based on different conditions and attribute values has been improved to align with the expected behavior indicated by the test cases.

The correction includes adjustments to the code blocks that handle decorators, imports, and yield statements, making sure that the calculations and return values are in line with the expected outputs. Furthermore, the management of the `self.previous_defs` attribute has been revised to ensure its proper functioning within the function.

The revised function aims to resolve the discrepancies observed in the test cases and error messages by providing accurate calculations and return values based on the specified conditions.

It's important to note that thorough testing should be conducted to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the corrections made to the function. Additionally, further adjustments may be required based on additional test cases or edge cases that need to be considered.
