The potential error location within the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` can be traced to the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable and the manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list. Both of these aspects contribute to the observed discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs in the test cases, leading to the assertion failures.

The occurrence of the bug is primarily due to the incorrect assignment of the `max_allowed` variable based on the conditions related to the `current_line.depth` and `current_line.is_decorator`. Additionally, the manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list does not align with the expected behavior in certain cases, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug in the function, the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable should be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure that it correctly reflects the expected behavior based on the `current_line` properties. Similarly, the code for manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list should be revised to ensure that the correct values are appended and removed based on the specified conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function includes updated conditional logic for `max_allowed` based on the specified conditions, as well as revised code for manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list. These changes are intended to address the identified issues and align the function's behavior with the expected outputs.
