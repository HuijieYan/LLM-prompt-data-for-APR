The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic and calculations related to decorators, as indicated by the test case failure and the error messages. The function is intended to determine the number of newlines to be inserted before or after a given line, based on various attributes of the line. The discrepancy between the expected and actual output suggests that the logic for handling decorators and the calculation of newlines is not functioning as expected.

The Bug:
The bug in the problematic function appears to be the incorrect handling of newlines within decorators, resulting in additional newlines being present in the actual formatted output compared to the expected output. Additionally, the management of `before` and `self.previous_defs` seems to lead to erroneous return values, as indicated by the test case failure.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Thoroughly review and potentially revise the conditional logic within the problematic function to ensure accurate handling of decorators and the calculation of newlines.

2. Verify the management of `before` and `self.previous_defs`, as their interactions with the conditional logic might be impacting the return values.

3. Ensure that the modifications to `first_leaf.prefix` have the intended effect on the `before` variable, and that the state of `self.previous_defs` stack is correctly managed to avoid unexpected changes.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
