The potential error location within the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` lies in the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth` property, as well as the manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list.

The inconsistent behavior observed in the test cases and the error message can be attributed to the following reasons:
1. Incorrect conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth`.
2. Flawed manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list, leading to incorrect values being appended or removed under certain conditions.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly revised to ensure that it correctly reflects the expected behavior based on the `current_line.depth`. Additionally, the code for manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list should be examined and corrected to ensure that the list is updated with the appropriate values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that resolves the identified issues and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The revised function corrects the conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` and ensures that the `self.previous_defs` list is manipulated correctly based on the specified conditions. This corrected version resolves the identified issues and ensures the expected behavior of the function.
