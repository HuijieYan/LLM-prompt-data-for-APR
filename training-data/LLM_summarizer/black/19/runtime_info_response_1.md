Based on the provided code and the variable runtime values and types, we can deduce the cause of the failures in the test cases.

In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic is intended to analyze the input `current_line` to determine the number of newlines to be inserted before it, as well as any additional demands for empty lines or indentation adjustments. 

Looking at the first failure case, where `current_line.leaves` contains `Leaf(AT, '@')` and `Leaf(NAME, 'property')`, the function is intended to classify this as a decorator and return 0 newlines before the line. However, the actual return value is `(2, 0)`. This implies that there is an issue with the evaluation of the rules related to decorators and the calculation of the newlines.

In analyzing the code, we note that there are multiple conditions based on `current_line` attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, and so on. It seems that the logic for deducing the number of newlines and indentation adjustments based on these attributes might be flawed, leading to incorrect return values.

Moreover, there's an issue with the `first_leaf.prefix` modification. When the leaf prefix is being reset to an empty string (`''`), this doesn't seem to be affecting the `before` variable as expected.

In cases where `self.previous_defs` is being modified, such as in the seventh failure case, the behavior of updating this attribute and applying the corresponding changes to `before` is not clear. It seems that the `self.previous_defs` stack is not being managed correctly.

Further analysis is required to understand the interactions of these attributes with the conditional logic and their effects on the return values. Corrections to the conditional logic and possibly the management of `before` and `self.previous_defs` are likely needed to rectify the issues observed in the test cases.
