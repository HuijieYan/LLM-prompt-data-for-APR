Based on the provided code and the error messages from the test cases, it seems that the issue lies within the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, particularly in the sections related to the handling of decorators and the calculation of newlines. The incorrect handling of these aspects is leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs of the test cases.

The potential reasons behind the bug include:
1. Incorrect conditional logic for determining the number of newlines before and after decorators.
2. Flawed management of the `before` variable and its interaction with different conditional branches.
3. Inconsistent handling of `self.previous_defs` stack and its impact on the calculation of newlines.
4. Unintended consequences of modifying the `first_leaf.prefix` attribute.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic based on different attributes of `current_line` should be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure accurate determination of empty line insertions before and after decorators. Additionally, the management of `before` and `self.previous_defs` should be revised to address any inconsistencies in their usage.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is as follows:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ...  (other class members and methods)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected code, adjustments have been made to the conditional logic related to decorators, the management of `before`, and the handling of `self.previous_defs` to ensure that the function accurately determines the number of newlines to be inserted before and after specific line types. These modifications address the identified potential sources of the bug and aim to produce the expected outputs for the test cases.
