Based on the given analysis, the bug occurs in the conditional logic for the assignment of the `max_allowed` variable and the manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The incorrect values for `max_allowed` and the erroneous manipulation of `self.previous_defs` lead to the discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs, resulting in assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` based on the `current_line.depth` and the manipulation of `self.previous_defs` need to be revised to ensure correct behavior and handling of different line properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0 or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The revised version of the function includes corrected conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` based on the properties of the `current_line`, as well as appropriate manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list. This fix addresses the issues identified in the buggy cases and ensures the correct behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
