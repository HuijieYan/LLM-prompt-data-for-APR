Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the test cases, it is evident that the issue lies within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function's logic related to decorators and their handling of newlines. The function currently produces incorrect outputs, leading to failures in the test cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic and calculations that determine the number of newlines to be inserted before and after decorators. This includes the handling of `current_line.is_decorator` and its impact on the return values, as well as the management of `before` and `self.previous_defs`.

The bug occurs due to incorrect conditional logic and calculations related to decorators within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This results in the incorrect determination of the number of newlines to be inserted, leading to formatting discrepancies observed in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review and revise the conditional logic and calculations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that pertain to decorators. Ensure correctness in determining the number of newlines before and after decorators.
2. Validate the impact of attributes like `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.depth`, and `self.previous_defs` on the return values, and adjust the handling as necessary.
3. Implement comprehensive test cases targeting the behavior of decorators and their impact on formatting to validate the corrections made to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the revised function, the conditional logic and calculations related to decorators have been adjusted to ensure the correct determination of newlines before and after decorators. Further, the handling of `before` and `self.previous_defs` has been updated to align with the expected behavior.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the formatting discrepancies observed in the test cases.
