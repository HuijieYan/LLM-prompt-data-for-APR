# Prompt
Given the source code of a function that exhibits bugs, alongside the source code of its corresponding test function and the error messages produced from the execution of the failed test case, you are tasked to extract and present relevant and significant information from both the test code and the error messages. This information is crucial for diagnosing and fixing the errors within the buggy function. You are encouraged to reference specific parts of the buggy function code and the test code to enhance the accuracy of your diagnosis. Moreover, it is acceptable and sometimes preferable to reference only partial test function code, omitting less relevant sections, to improve clarity and focus on the issue. Please ensure that your output is as detailed and comprehensive as possible. A detailed and exhaustive exploration of the provided codes and error messages is encouraged, aiming to foster a deep understanding of the problem, thereby facilitating an effective and informed debugging process.

The followings are test functions under directory `tests/test_black.py` in the project.
```python
@patch("black.dump_to_file", dump_to_stderr)
def test_comment_in_decorator(self) -> None:
    source, expected = read_data("comments6")
    actual = fs(source)
    self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)
    black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)
    black.assert_stable(source, actual, line_length=ll)
```

The error message that corresponds the the above test functions is:
```
self = <test_black.BlackTestCase testMethod=test_comment_in_decorator>

    @patch("black.dump_to_file", dump_to_stderr)
    def test_comment_in_decorator(self) -> None:
        source, expected = read_data("comments6")
        actual = fs(source)
>       self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)
