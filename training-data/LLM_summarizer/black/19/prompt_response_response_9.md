Based on the analysis provided, it appears that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of decorators and the calculation of newlines. The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in determining the number of newlines and indentation adjustments before and after decorators, resulting in formatting discrepancies observed in the test cases.

The potential error locations within the problematic function are:
1. Incorrect logic for determining the number of newlines and indentation adjustments before and after decorators.
2. Flawed calculation of newlines and indentation adjustments based on the attributes of `current_line`.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug include:
- Misinterpretation of decorator-related conditions and incorrect handling of newlines.
- Inaccurate calculation of newlines and indentation adjustments based on the attributes of `current_line`.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Review and revise the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function related to decorators, ensuring accurate determination of the number of newlines and indentation adjustments.
2. Correct the calculation of newlines and indentation adjustments based on the attributes of `current_line`, ensuring that the expected formatting is achieved.
3. Thoroughly examine the interactions of attributes and conditional logic, making necessary adjustments to ensure correct determination of newlines and indentation adjustments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Please note that the corrected code includes adjustments to the conditions and calculations for determining newlines and indentation adjustments, particularly related to decorators and other attributes of `current_line`.
