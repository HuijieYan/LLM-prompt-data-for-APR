Based on the analysis of the test case and the errors observed, it appears that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect assignment of the `max_allowed` variable based on conditional logic. Additionally, there are issues with appending the correct values to the `self.previous_defs` list in certain cases.

The specific buggy cases identified:
1. Incorrect assignment of `max_allowed` when `current_line.depth == 0` and `current_line.is_decorator` is True.
2. Issues with updating `max_allowed` and appending values to `self.previous_defs` under certain conditions.

To address these issues, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Revise the conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` based on the `current_line.depth` and `current_line.is_decorator` properties to ensure correct assignment of values.
2. Review the conditional logic for appending values to `self.previous_defs` and update it to handle the conditions properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that resolves the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional logic for updating `max_allowed` and appending values to `self.previous_defs` has been revised to address the identified issues. The corrected logic ensures that the `max_allowed` variable is assigned the correct value based on the specified conditions, and the handling of `self.previous_defs` is updated to handle the conditions appropriately. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
