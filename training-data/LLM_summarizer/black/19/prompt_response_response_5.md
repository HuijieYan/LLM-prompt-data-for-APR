The identified potential error locations within the problematic function are as follows:

1. The conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth` is flawed, leading to incorrect assignments.
2. The manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list is not accurately executed under certain conditions, resulting in incorrect updates to the list.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to the incorrect conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable and the flawed manipulation of the `self.previous_defs` list. These issues lead to incorrect assignments and updates, causing discrepancies in the function's behavior and output.

To address these issues, the following approaches can be taken for fixing the bug:

1. Correct the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth` to ensure accurate assignments.
2. Review and revise the code responsible for manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list to accurately update the list under all relevant conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(0)  # Append 0 to self.previous_defs
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable and manipulating the `self.previous_defs` list has been reviewed and revised to address the identified issues. These corrections aim to ensure accurate assignments and updates, resulting in a more reliable behavior of the function. This revised version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function to resolve the identified issues.
