Based on the test cases and error message, there seems to be an issue with the calculation of newlines and indentation adjustments within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, particularly in the context of decorators. The error may be due to incorrect handling of conditions and calculations related to decorators, resulting in the insertion of additional empty lines in the actual output compared to the expected output.

To address the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that pertains to decorators should be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure the expected formatting is achieved. Additionally, the management of variables such as `before` and `self.previous_defs` should be closely examined to rectify any inconsistencies in their handling and impact on the return values.

Upon thorough analysis, it is apparent that the issue lies within the conditional logic and variable management related to decorators, newlines, and indentation adjustments. Correcting these aspects of the function's implementation should lead to the resolution of the bugs and alignment with the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the problematic `_maybe_empty_lines` function, including the necessary adjustments based on the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == self.previous_defs[-1] else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, newlines, and indentation adjustments has been revised to ensure the expected output is achieved, addressing the identified issues and bugs. The adjustments made should resolve the inconsistencies observed in the test cases and align the function's behavior with the expected outcomes.
