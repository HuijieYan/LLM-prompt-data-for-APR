## Response 1
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `Line` object as input and returns a tuple of two integers. 

Upon thorough analysis of the expected values and types for different input parameter combinations, let's go through each test case to identify the issues:

**Case 1:**
- The first issue is with the `before` variable. In this case, `before` should be equal to the minimum between the count of newlines in the prefix of `first_leaf` and `max_allowed`. 
- The value of `before` is expected to be 1, but the function assigns it as 0.
- The correct assignment should be `before = min(before, max_allowed)`.

**Case 2:**
- The previous line is a decorator, so no additional empty lines should be inserted. However, the function returns `(0, 0)` instead of the expected `(0, 0)`.
- The logic for detecting the previous line as a decorator is not accurately implemented, and the correct logic needs to be applied to handle this case.

**Case 3:**
- The current line is a decorator, and the previous line is not None. Therefore, the expected newlines should be 1, according to the conditions provided. However, the function returns `(2, 0)` instead of the expected `(1, 0)`.
- The logic for handling decorators and determining the number of newlines needs to be corrected.

**Case 4:**
- Similar to Case 2, the function returns `(0, 0)` when the previous line is not a decorator, but the expected return is `(1, 0)`.
- The logic for determining the presence of a decorator and when to insert newlines needs to be revised.

**Case 5:**
- This case is similar to Case 4. The expected return should be `(1, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)`.
- The issue is with the condition for handling previous lines related to imports and yields.

**Cases 6 and 7:**
- These test cases both have an issue with the `newlines` variable. In both cases, the expected value of `newlines` is 2, but the function is returning 2 in Case 6 and 0 in Case 7.
- This indicates that the logic for setting the value of `newlines` is incorrect and needs to be adjusted.

**Case 8:**
- The issue in this case is with the `before` variable. The expected value is 1, but the function returns 0.
- This means that the condition related to the depth of the current line yielding 1 additional newline needs to be re-evaluated.

With these findings, it's evident that the function's conditional and logical structure requires meticulous review and the appropriate corrections. The root issues with variable assignments and conditional branching must be scrutinized and rectified to align with the expected output across all test cases. This debugging process necessitates a comprehensive and insightful understanding of the function's behavior and the underlying logic, which will lead to the necessary adjustments.
