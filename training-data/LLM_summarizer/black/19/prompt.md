The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/test_black.py` in the project.
```python
@patch("black.dump_to_file", dump_to_stderr)
def test_comment_in_decorator(self) -> None:
    source, expected = read_data("comments6")
    actual = fs(source)
    self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)
    black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)
    black.assert_stable(source, actual, line_length=ll)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
Upon reviewing the test function `test_comment_in_decorator` in `tests/test_black.py`, the error message located at line 633 asserts that the `assertFormatEqual` method failed. Specifically, the call to `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)` results in an `AssertionError` because the expected and actual outputs do not match.

Comparing the expected and actual outputs, the error message highlights the differences between the two outputs: 
- The expected output is: `@pro[13 chars]: X\n@property\n# TODO: Y\n# TODO: Z\n@propert[21 chars]ss\n`
- The actual output is: `@pro[13 chars]: X\n\n\n@property\n# TODO: Y\n# TODO: Z\n\n\n[29 chars]ss\n`

The differences between the two outputs are particularly found in the formatting of comments and newlines. The expected output contains certain comments and additional newlines that are not present in the actual output, which results in the assertion failure.

From this, it can be inferred that there is an issue with the implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, as it is responsible for adding or removing newlines based on certain conditions. Specifically, the discrepancies in formatting between the expected and actual outputs indicate that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may not be handling newlines or comments correctly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

In order to diagnose and resolve the errors within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, further examination and debugging of the relevant parts of the function - particularly those related to handling comments and newlines - is necessary. By pinpointing the specific conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that are responsible for the formatting differences, a more accurate diagnosis and resolution of the bugs can be achieved.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided source code and the detailed inspection of the input parameters and variable runtime values in different buggy cases, several issues have been identified. Let's go through each buggy case one by one:

Buggy case 1:
- The current_line.depth is 0, and current_line.is_decorator is True. The function should update max_allowed to 2 and set before to 0.
- The variable before is correctly set to 0, but max_allowed is not being correctly updated. This indicates an issue with the conditional logic in the function that assigns values to max_allowed.

Buggy case 2:
- Similar to Buggy case 1, the current_line.depth is 0, and current_line.is_decorator is False. The function should again update max_allowed to 2 and set before to 0.
- Once again, max_allowed is not being correctly updated, indicating a problem with the conditional logic for max_allowed assignment.

Buggy case 3:
- In this case, the issue with max_allowed assignment persists as the behavior is similar to the previous cases.

Buggy case 4:
- The issue with max_allowed persists in this case as well, indicating a consistent problem in the conditional logic for max_allowed assignment.

Buggy case 5:
- The case remains the same as before, with an incorrect assignment for max_allowed.

Buggy case 6:
- Like the previous cases, the same issue with max_allowed assignment persists.

Buggy case 7:
- This case introduces a new issue related to self.previous_defs. The function should be appending 0 to self.previous_defs, but the appended value is incorrectly set as an empty list.

Buggy case 8:
- In this case, the function should update max_allowed to 1 and set before to 0, considering the depth and self.previous_defs values. Additionally, max_allowed should be reduced by 1 when the depth is not 0.
- However, max_allowed is incorrectly set to 1 instead of 2, and the conditional logic for this behavior appears to be flawed.

Based on the pattern in the buggy cases, it's apparent that there are issues with how the max_allowed variable is being assigned a value based on conditional logic related to the current_line.depth and current_line.is_decorator. Additionally, there is an issue with appending the correct values to the self.previous_defs list in certain cases.

In conclusion, to address the issues identified in the buggy cases, the conditional logic for assigning values to max_allowed needs to be thoroughly reviewed and possibly revised. Additionally, the code for updating the self.previous_defs list should be examined and corrected as well. These changes should rectify the faulty behavior observed in the test cases.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Summary:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `Line` object and returns a tuple of two integers. It begins by setting `max_allowed` to 1 and then potentially updates it to 2 based on the `depth` property of the `current_line`. Next, it processes the `leaves` property of the `current_line` and adjusts the `before` variable accordingly. Then, it checks various conditions related to the type of the current line (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`) as well as the relationship with the `previous_line` and updates the return values accordingly. Additionally, it manipulates the `self.previous_defs` list based on the `depth` property and updates it under certain conditions. The analysis of the expected variable values and types before function return across different test cases provides valuable insights into the function's behavior and logic, shedding light on its potential issues and discrepancies.
