The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the `current_line.depth` and `current_line.is_decorator`. Additionally, there are issues with appending the correct values to the `self.previous_defs` list in certain cases.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Incorrect conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable, which leads to incorrect handling of newlines before and after the current line.
2. Flawed logic for appending values to the `self.previous_defs` list, which disrupts the correct handling of empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and revise the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable to ensure that it accurately reflects the desired behavior based on the `current_line.depth` and `current_line.is_decorator`.
2. Carefully examine the code for appending values to the `self.previous_defs` list and correct the logic to accurately maintain the state of previous definitions within the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 or current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code addresses the conditional logic for updating the `max_allowed` variable and ensures accurate handling of newlines before and after the current line. It also revises the logic for appending values to the `self.previous_defs` list to maintain the correct state of previous definitions within the function. The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
