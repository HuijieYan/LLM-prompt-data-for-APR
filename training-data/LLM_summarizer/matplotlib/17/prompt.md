Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_colorbar.py` in the project.
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not
    # overflow ``int16(20000) - int16(-20000)`` or
    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim

@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not
    # overflow ``int16(20000) - int16(-20000)`` or
    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test functions `test_colorbar_int` are designed to check if we cast to float early enough to prevent overflow for integer inputs. This test creates a 2D array of integers and then assigns the result of converting each integer to type `int16` into the variable `im`. The subsequent execution of `fig.colorbar(im)` leads to the error. The failed test case reports a RuntimeWarning: "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" and confirms that the buggy function that needs to be diagnosed is `nonsingular`.

Analyzing the specific failed test case with the given error message reveals that the values `vmin` and `vmax` are set to -32768 and 0, respectively. The `nonsingular` function calculates the `maxabsvalue` using the formula max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) and proceeds to raise a RuntimeWarning related to an overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

The critical information for diagnosing the issue lies in the `nonsingular` function code and the specifics of the error message. The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a given range to avoid singularities. It should return the endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary. According to the error message, there is an overflow encountered in the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. We need to carefully diagnose this overflow and correct it.

Upon careful inspection of the `nonsingular` function, it becomes evident that the variable `maxabsvalue` is being calculated using a formula that involves the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, and this is where the issue arises. For very large integer values, absolute function may cause an overflow in negative numbers.

Thus, a possible solution would be to ensure that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating point numbers before applying the absolute function. By converting the input parameters to floating point before taking their absolute value, the risk of encountering an overflow in operations involving potentially large integer values can be mitigated. Additionally, further diagnostics and testing with large integer values should be undertaken to validate the fix and ensure that the updated `nonsingular` function effectively avoids the overflow condition reported in the failed test case.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the provided variable logs, we can identify specific reasons why the tests are failing.

In the first buggy case, the input parameters have values of vmin = 0 and vmax = 1. The initial values of vmin and vmax are integers. However, when the function returns, the values are changed to float. This is due to the automatic type conversion that occurs when performing arithmetic operations with different types. The values are converted to float before the function returns, which is expected behavior in Python.

The variable swapped remains False, indicating that the if condition checking for vmax < vmin did not trigger. The maxabsvalue is correctly calculated as 1.0, which indicates that the conditions didn't match the threshold for the subsequent block of code to execute. It suggests that the problem lies with the conditions in the subsequent if-elif blocks.

In the second case, the input parameters have values of vmin = -0.5 and vmax = 1.5, both of type float. On returning, the swapped variable remains False, and the maxabsvalue is correctly calculated as 1.5. This indicates that the problem is not with the initial sanity check and swapping of values.

The third case is particularly interesting because it involves swapping vmin and vmax due to vmin > vmax. However, despite swapping being performed correctly, the subsequent checks fail to modify the endpoints as intended. The maxabsvalue here is correctly calculated as 0.5, indicating that the conditions within the if-elif blocks should have been triggered, but something is causing them to fail in this scenario.

In the fourth case, the function is returning the expected values of -0.001 and 0.001 due to the input parameters being infinite. This behavior is consistent with the behavior specified in the function's documentation. Therefore, this is not a buggy behavior, but the test was likely expecting different results.

Cases five, six, seven, and eight exhibit similar behavior to the first two cases, indicating an issue with the conditional checks and subsequent calculations inside the function.

Upon analyzing the function and the variable logs, it becomes clear that the issue lies with the conditional checks and calculations within the if-elif blocks. The conditional logic and mathematical operations within those blocks are not handling the input parameters and conditions correctly, leading to the function not behaving as expected and failing the test cases. This suggests that there may be logical errors in these blocks that need to be carefully examined and fixed.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the `nonsingular` function, the goal is to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes the initial endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, as well as other optional parameters such as `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`.

The function first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not a finite number, and if so, it returns the values `-expander` and `expander`. If `vmax` is less than `vmin`, the function swaps their values and keeps a record of this in the `swapped` variable.

The maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` is calculated and stored in the `maxabsvalue` variable. It then checks if this value is less than a threshold based on `tiny`, and if so, it expands the interval by setting `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than the maximum absolute value times `tiny`, the function further expands the interval, unless both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero, in which case it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the endpoints were swapped initially and the `increasing` flag is false, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax` again.

Based on the expected return values in the test cases, it is evident that the function should correctly handle different scenarios of input parameters and satisfy the expected variable values before returning.
