When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The main bug in the provided `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of the input values when the range becomes small and creates conditions leading to singularities. The `nonsingular` function has a set of parameters including `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The error messages indicate that there is a RuntimeWarning, specifically a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute," which occurs when calculating the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`.

The error messages also provide specific calls to the `nonsingular` function along with the input values and other relevant parameters. In this case, the input values are `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0`, and other parameters include `expander = 0.1`, `tiny = 1e-15`, and `increasing = True`.

Looking at the `nonsingular` function, the problem stems from the line:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

This line is trying to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` in order to determine if the range is too small and requires adjustment. However, for large negative integer values like `-32768`, the `abs` function encounters overflow issues, resulting in the observed RuntimeWarning.

In order to resolve this issue, the `abs` function needs to be updated to accommodate such large negative values and avoid the overflow. A potential solution could involve introducing an alternative approach to calculate the maximum absolute value without encountering overflow problems.

The error messages also indicate the specific conditions that led to the RuntimeWarning, and the inputs associated with the problematic call are provided. Understanding this context can help in devising an appropriate solution to fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

From the given variable runtime values and the type of inputs, it seems that the function "nonsingular" is not handling the cases correctly. Let's analyze each of the buggy cases one by one:

### Buggy Case 1:
In this case, the input values are 0 and 1 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The function should return these values as the range is not too small. However, the output values are 0.0 and 1.0 instead of 0 and 1, which seems correct. However, the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1.0 instead of 1, which indicates that the condition for the "maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny" might be triggering an incorrect update.

### Buggy Case 2:
The input values are -0.5 and 1.5 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output should remain the same as the range is not too small. The output values are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 1.5, suggesting that the condition for the range being small might be improperly applied here.

### Buggy Case 3:
In this case, the input values are 0.5 and -0.5 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The values are swapped, and the output values -0.5 and 0.5 are correct. The "swapped" variable is true, and the "maxabsvalue" is 0.5, indicating that the swapping logic and maxabsvalue calculation are working as expected.

### Buggy Case 4:
The input values are -inf and inf for vmin and vmax, respectively. The correct output for this case should be -0.001 and 0.001 as one of the input values is infinite. The function is returning the correct values in this case.

### Buggy Case 5:
The input integer values are -20000 and 20000 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 20000, which seems to be correct.

### Buggy Case 6:
The input float values are -20000.0 and 20000.0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 20000.0, which seems to be correct.

### Buggy Case 7:
The input integer values are -32768 and 0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 32768, indicating that the maxabsvalue calculation looks correct.

### Buggy Case 8:
The input float values are -32768.0 and 0.0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 32768, suggesting that these values are computed correctly.

After analyzing the variable runtime values and the type inside the buggy function, it seems that the conditions and calculations for small ranges (as defined by the variable 'tiny' and max absolute value) might not be correctly applied. The logic to check if the range is too small and the subsequent expansion might be the cause of the bug. Additional tests and in-depth checking of the conditional logic within the function will help pinpoint the exact issue.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function provided, `nonsingular`, is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. It accepts several input parameters, including `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The function then performs a series of calculations and condition checks to manipulate the input `vmin` and `vmax` as described and returns the modified values.

Based on the expected return values for different test cases, as well as the input and expected output values, we can analyze the function's code to identify issues and make corrections as necessary.

1. **Expected Return Values for Case 1**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: 0 (int)
     - `vmax`: 1 (int)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `swapped`: False (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 1 (int)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 1, we can follow the logic of each conditional block within the `nonsingular` function:
   
   - The initial condition checks for non-finite values of `vmin` and `vmax`, returning `-expander` and `expander` if either or both are not finite.
   - Following this, the function proceeds to check if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. 
   - After the above checks, the function calculates the `maxabsvalue` and performs additional checks based on the calculated values.
   - The `swapped` variable seems to be set based on whether `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped during the process.
   - Given that `vmin` and `vmax` in this case have valid finite values, it's expected that the function doesn't return the values `-expander` and `expander`, as both `vmin` and `vmax` are also finite and non-zero.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 1:
   - Based on the expected variable values, the function should return `vmin` and `vmax` themselves, not the `-expander` and `expander`.
   - Verify the logic for the conditional checks and calculations to ensure that the function returns the expected values.

2. **Expected Return Values for Case 2**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: -0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: 1.5 (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `swapped`: False (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 1.5 (float)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 2:
   
   - Similar to the analysis of case 1, the function should not return `-expander` and `expander`, but rather the modified `vmin` and `vmax` values.
   - The `maxabsvalue` in this case is expected to be 1.5.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 2:
   - Review the calculation and conditional sections to ensure that the function correctly returns the modified `vmin` and `vmax` instead of `-expander` and `expander`.

3. **Expected Return Values for Case 3**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: 0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: -0.5 (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `vmin`: -0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: 0.5 (float)
     - `swapped`: True (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 0.5 (float)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 3:
   
   - The expected `maxabsvalue` is 0.5, and the `swapped` variable is expected to be True in this case, indicating that `vmin` and `vmax` were swapped.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 3:
   - Validate the swapping logic and calculate the actual values based on the condition checks.

4. **Expected Return Values for Case 4**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: -inf (float)
     - `vmax`: inf (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)

   For this particular case, since both `vmin` and `vmax` are non-finite (either infinity or -infinity), the function should return the values `-expander` and `expander` according to the initial condition check.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 4:
   - Check the condition to ensure that it correctly handles non-finite values and returns `-expander` and `expander` as expected.

In general, the corrective actions involve adjusting the logic of the function based on the expected results to ensure that it behaves as intended for the specified test cases. Considerations should be made to address the conditions related to the input and expected variable values, ensuring that the modifications to the `vmin` and `vmax` values are performed correctly.

After identifying the necessary corrective actions, the updated function code can be tested to confirm that it meets the specified conditions and correctly returns the expected output for each test case.
