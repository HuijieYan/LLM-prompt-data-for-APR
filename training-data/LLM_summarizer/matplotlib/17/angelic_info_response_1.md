In the `nonsingular` function, the goal is to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes the initial endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, as well as other optional parameters such as `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`.

The function first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not a finite number, and if so, it returns the values `-expander` and `expander`. If `vmax` is less than `vmin`, the function swaps their values and keeps a record of this in the `swapped` variable.

The maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` is calculated and stored in the `maxabsvalue` variable. It then checks if this value is less than a threshold based on `tiny`, and if so, it expands the interval by setting `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than the maximum absolute value times `tiny`, the function further expands the interval, unless both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero, in which case it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the endpoints were swapped initially and the `increasing` flag is false, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax` again.

Based on the expected return values in the test cases, it is evident that the function should correctly handle different scenarios of input parameters and satisfy the expected variable values before returning.
