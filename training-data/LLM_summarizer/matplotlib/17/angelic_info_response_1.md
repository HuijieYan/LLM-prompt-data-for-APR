The function provided, `nonsingular`, is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. It accepts several input parameters, including `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The function then performs a series of calculations and condition checks to manipulate the input `vmin` and `vmax` as described and returns the modified values.

Based on the expected return values for different test cases, as well as the input and expected output values, we can analyze the function's code to identify issues and make corrections as necessary.

1. **Expected Return Values for Case 1**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: 0 (int)
     - `vmax`: 1 (int)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `swapped`: False (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 1 (int)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 1, we can follow the logic of each conditional block within the `nonsingular` function:
   
   - The initial condition checks for non-finite values of `vmin` and `vmax`, returning `-expander` and `expander` if either or both are not finite.
   - Following this, the function proceeds to check if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. 
   - After the above checks, the function calculates the `maxabsvalue` and performs additional checks based on the calculated values.
   - The `swapped` variable seems to be set based on whether `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped during the process.
   - Given that `vmin` and `vmax` in this case have valid finite values, it's expected that the function doesn't return the values `-expander` and `expander`, as both `vmin` and `vmax` are also finite and non-zero.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 1:
   - Based on the expected variable values, the function should return `vmin` and `vmax` themselves, not the `-expander` and `expander`.
   - Verify the logic for the conditional checks and calculations to ensure that the function returns the expected values.

2. **Expected Return Values for Case 2**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: -0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: 1.5 (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `swapped`: False (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 1.5 (float)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 2:
   
   - Similar to the analysis of case 1, the function should not return `-expander` and `expander`, but rather the modified `vmin` and `vmax` values.
   - The `maxabsvalue` in this case is expected to be 1.5.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 2:
   - Review the calculation and conditional sections to ensure that the function correctly returns the modified `vmin` and `vmax` instead of `-expander` and `expander`.

3. **Expected Return Values for Case 3**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: 0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: -0.5 (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)
   - Expected Variable Values:
     - `vmin`: -0.5 (float)
     - `vmax`: 0.5 (float)
     - `swapped`: True (bool)
     - `maxabsvalue`: 0.5 (float)

   When analyzing the code in relation to the expected return values for case 3:
   
   - The expected `maxabsvalue` is 0.5, and the `swapped` variable is expected to be True in this case, indicating that `vmin` and `vmax` were swapped.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 3:
   - Validate the swapping logic and calculate the actual values based on the condition checks.

4. **Expected Return Values for Case 4**:
   - Input Parameters:
     - `vmin`: -inf (float)
     - `vmax`: inf (float)
     - `expander`: 0.05 (float)
     - `tiny`: 1e-15 (float)
     - `increasing`: True (bool)

   For this particular case, since both `vmin` and `vmax` are non-finite (either infinity or -infinity), the function should return the values `-expander` and `expander` according to the initial condition check.

   **Corrective Actions** for case 4:
   - Check the condition to ensure that it correctly handles non-finite values and returns `-expander` and `expander` as expected.

In general, the corrective actions involve adjusting the logic of the function based on the expected results to ensure that it behaves as intended for the specified test cases. Considerations should be made to address the conditions related to the input and expected variable values, ensuring that the modifications to the `vmin` and `vmax` values are performed correctly.

After identifying the necessary corrective actions, the updated function code can be tested to confirm that it meets the specified conditions and correctly returns the expected output for each test case.
