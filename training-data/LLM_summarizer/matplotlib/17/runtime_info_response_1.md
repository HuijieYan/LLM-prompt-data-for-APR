From the given variable runtime values and the type of inputs, it seems that the function "nonsingular" is not handling the cases correctly. Let's analyze each of the buggy cases one by one:

### Buggy Case 1:
In this case, the input values are 0 and 1 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The function should return these values as the range is not too small. However, the output values are 0.0 and 1.0 instead of 0 and 1, which seems correct. However, the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1.0 instead of 1, which indicates that the condition for the "maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny" might be triggering an incorrect update.

### Buggy Case 2:
The input values are -0.5 and 1.5 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output should remain the same as the range is not too small. The output values are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 1.5, suggesting that the condition for the range being small might be improperly applied here.

### Buggy Case 3:
In this case, the input values are 0.5 and -0.5 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The values are swapped, and the output values -0.5 and 0.5 are correct. The "swapped" variable is true, and the "maxabsvalue" is 0.5, indicating that the swapping logic and maxabsvalue calculation are working as expected.

### Buggy Case 4:
The input values are -inf and inf for vmin and vmax, respectively. The correct output for this case should be -0.001 and 0.001 as one of the input values is infinite. The function is returning the correct values in this case.

### Buggy Case 5:
The input integer values are -20000 and 20000 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 20000, which seems to be correct.

### Buggy Case 6:
The input float values are -20000.0 and 20000.0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 20000.0, which seems to be correct.

### Buggy Case 7:
The input integer values are -32768 and 0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 32768, indicating that the maxabsvalue calculation looks correct.

### Buggy Case 8:
The input float values are -32768.0 and 0.0 for vmin and vmax, respectively. The output values for this case are not mentioned, but the "swapped" variable is false and the "maxabsvalue" is 32768, suggesting that these values are computed correctly.

After analyzing the variable runtime values and the type inside the buggy function, it seems that the conditions and calculations for small ranges (as defined by the variable 'tiny' and max absolute value) might not be correctly applied. The logic to check if the range is too small and the subsequent expansion might be the cause of the bug. Additional tests and in-depth checking of the conditional logic within the function will help pinpoint the exact issue.
