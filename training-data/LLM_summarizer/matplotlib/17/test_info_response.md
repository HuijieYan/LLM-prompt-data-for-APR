The test functions `test_colorbar_int()` involve the testing of color bar generation within the testing module `test_colorbar.py`. The functions are parametrized with different sets of clim values, which are then used to assert that the vmin and vmax values of the color bar match the given clim values. 

The error message that pertains to this particular test case is indicating an overflow problem. Specifically, it points to an issue within the internal implementation of a function used to ensure that the vmin and vmax values of the color bar do not lead to singularities. The runtime warning indicates that an overflow was encountered when processing the scalar absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The test code itself seems to implement the generation of a color bar using `clim` values and then checks if the vmin and vmax of the color bar match the ones provided. It indirectly utilizes the testing framework's `assert` method, expecting the condition `(im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim` to be met.

The source of the issue is most likely the transformation of integer `clim` values to a numpy data type in the following line of the test code:
```python
im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
```

After transforming the `clim` values, the `imshow` function is likely to be generating the overflow in the underlying code. This subsequently results in the error during the `fig.colorbar(im)` function call inside the test function.

To fix the issue, one potential solution would be to convert the input clim parameters to a different datatype that will not overflow when processed by internal functions. Another potential solution is to modify the internal implementation to ensure that overflow scenarios are handled in a more graceful manner, ensuring that the operations do not lead to runtime warnings or terminated processes.
