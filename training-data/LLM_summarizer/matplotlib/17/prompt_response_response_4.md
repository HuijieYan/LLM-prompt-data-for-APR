Based on the analysis of the test case and its relationship with the error message, it is evident that the bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of the maximum absolute value. The bug occurs specifically when the input values are large negative integers, causing overflow issues when calculating the absolute value.

The potential error location within the function is identified as the line:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```
This line of code is responsible for calculating the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`, leading to overflow issues when dealing with large negative numbers.

The bug occurs because the current approach to calculating the maximum absolute value using the `abs` function is not suitable for handling large negative integers, resulting in the overflow error.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to implement an alternative method to calculate the maximum absolute value without encountering overflow problems. One potential solution is to use conditional checks to compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` without directly calculating the maximum. This approach can help avoid overflow issues and ensure the correct determination of the maximum absolute value.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.abs(vmin) < np.abs(vmax):
        maxabsvalue = np.abs(vmax)
    else:
        maxabsvalue = np.abs(vmin)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
The revised function addresses the bug by using conditional checks to compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` to determine the maximum absolute value, avoiding overflow issues. This ensures that the function correctly calculates and returns the modified endpoints without encountering the previous bug.
