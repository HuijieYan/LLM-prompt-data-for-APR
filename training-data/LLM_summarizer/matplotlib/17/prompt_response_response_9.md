Based on the provided information and analysis, it is clear that the issue lies within the conditional checks and calculations inside the `nonsingular` function. The specific problem causing the failed test cases and error messages is related to the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, which can lead to an overflow when dealing with very large integer values.

To fix this bug, it is crucial to ensure that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating-point numbers before applying the absolute function. By converting the input parameters to floating point before taking their absolute value, the risk of encountering an overflow in operations involving potentially large integer values can be mitigated.

Based on this approach, the revised version of the `nonsingular` function to resolve the bug is provided below:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the revised function, both `vmin` and `vmax` are explicitly converted to float using the `float()` function before any arithmetic or conditional operations are applied. This ensures that the calculations involving the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax are performed on floating-point numbers, preventing potential overflow issues when dealing with large integer values.

The revised `nonsingular` function now addresses the bug and should provide correct and consistent behavior when handling different input scenarios, as well as satisfy the expected values in the test cases.
