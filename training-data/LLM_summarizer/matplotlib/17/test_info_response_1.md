The test functions `test_colorbar_int` are designed to check if we cast to float early enough to prevent overflow for integer inputs. This test creates a 2D array of integers and then assigns the result of converting each integer to type `int16` into the variable `im`. The subsequent execution of `fig.colorbar(im)` leads to the error. The failed test case reports a RuntimeWarning: "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" and confirms that the buggy function that needs to be diagnosed is `nonsingular`.

Analyzing the specific failed test case with the given error message reveals that the values `vmin` and `vmax` are set to -32768 and 0, respectively. The `nonsingular` function calculates the `maxabsvalue` using the formula max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) and proceeds to raise a RuntimeWarning related to an overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

The critical information for diagnosing the issue lies in the `nonsingular` function code and the specifics of the error message. The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a given range to avoid singularities. It should return the endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary. According to the error message, there is an overflow encountered in the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. We need to carefully diagnose this overflow and correct it.

Upon careful inspection of the `nonsingular` function, it becomes evident that the variable `maxabsvalue` is being calculated using a formula that involves the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, and this is where the issue arises. For very large integer values, absolute function may cause an overflow in negative numbers.

Thus, a possible solution would be to ensure that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating point numbers before applying the absolute function. By converting the input parameters to floating point before taking their absolute value, the risk of encountering an overflow in operations involving potentially large integer values can be mitigated. Additionally, further diagnostics and testing with large integer values should be undertaken to validate the fix and ensure that the updated `nonsingular` function effectively avoids the overflow condition reported in the failed test case.
