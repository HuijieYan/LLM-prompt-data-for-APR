The main bug in the provided `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of the input values when the range becomes small and creates conditions leading to singularities. The `nonsingular` function has a set of parameters including `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The error messages indicate that there is a RuntimeWarning, specifically a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute," which occurs when calculating the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`.

The error messages also provide specific calls to the `nonsingular` function along with the input values and other relevant parameters. In this case, the input values are `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0`, and other parameters include `expander = 0.1`, `tiny = 1e-15`, and `increasing = True`.

Looking at the `nonsingular` function, the problem stems from the line:
```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

This line is trying to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` in order to determine if the range is too small and requires adjustment. However, for large negative integer values like `-32768`, the `abs` function encounters overflow issues, resulting in the observed RuntimeWarning.

In order to resolve this issue, the `abs` function needs to be updated to accommodate such large negative values and avoid the overflow. A potential solution could involve introducing an alternative approach to calculate the maximum absolute value without encountering overflow problems.

The error messages also indicate the specific conditions that led to the RuntimeWarning, and the inputs associated with the problematic call are provided. Understanding this context can help in devising an appropriate solution to fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function.
