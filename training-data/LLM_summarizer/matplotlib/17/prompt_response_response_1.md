The bug in the provided `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculation of the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`, particularly when dealing with large negative integer values. The use of the `abs` function to calculate `maxabsvalue` is triggering overflow issues, resulting in a RuntimeWarning.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the calculation for `maxabsvalue` needs to be adjusted to handle the potential overflow when dealing with large negative values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use conditional statements to compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` without directly using the `abs` function. This can help in avoiding the overflow issues that arise when dealing with large negative values.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = vmin if vmin >= 0 else -vmin
    abs_vmax = vmax if vmax >= 0 else -vmax

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs_vmin
            vmax += expander*abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are calculated using conditional statements to handle potential overflow issues with large negative values. This helps to resolve the bug related to the occurrence of the RuntimeWarning.

By incorporating the suggested adjustments, the corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy version to ensure that the function performs as intended without triggering overflow issues.
