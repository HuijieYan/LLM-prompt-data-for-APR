Based on the analysis of the error message and the buggy function, it is evident that the issue lies in the calculation of the maximum absolute value `maxabsvalue` using integer input parameters in the `nonsingular` function. The use of the `max` and `abs` functions with integer inputs can lead to an overflow condition, which triggers the reported error message. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating point numbers before calculating their absolute value.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that resolves the issue by explicitly converting the input parameters to floating point numbers before performing the absolute value calculation:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    # Convert vmin and vmax to float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version of the function, we explicitly convert `vmin` and `vmax` to floating point numbers using the `float` function before calculating their absolute values. This ensures that the calculation of `maxabsvalue` does not encounter an overflow condition when dealing with potentially large integer values, thereby resolving the bug. The modified function address the issue identified in the analysis and should prevent the reported RuntimeWarning related to an overflow encountered in scalar absolute.
