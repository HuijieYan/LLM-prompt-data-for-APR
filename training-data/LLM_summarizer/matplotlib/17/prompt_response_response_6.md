The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of the input values when the range becomes small and creates conditions leading to singularities. The `abs` function encounters overflow issues for large negative integer values, resulting in a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute." This occurs during the calculation of the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix this bug, the calculation of the maximum absolute value needs to be updated to accommodate large negative values and avoid overflow problems. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `np.maximum` function to calculate the maximum absolute value, which should handle the overflow issue for large negative values.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This revised version addresses the issue by using `np.maximum` to calculate the maximum absolute value, avoiding overflow problems for large negative values. It also correctly handles the conditions for adjusting the range when it becomes too small, as specified in the original function's documentation. This corrected version should now resolve the bug and ensure proper handling of the endpoint values to avoid singularities.
