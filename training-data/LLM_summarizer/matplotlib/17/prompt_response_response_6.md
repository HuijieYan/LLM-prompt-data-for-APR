Based on the provided buggy function and the failed test case, the issue appears to be related to the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, which leads to an overflow when dealing with large integer values. The function `nonsingular` aims to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, but the incorrect handling of the absolute value calculation causes the function to produce unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating point numbers before applying the absolute function. This will prevent the overflow issue when dealing with large integer values and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With this in mind, the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function is provided below:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # Convert to float before calculating absolute value
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))  # Convert to float before applying expander
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))  # Convert to float before applying expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are explicitly converted to float before calculating their absolute values or applying the expander, thus addressing the potential overflow issue with large integer values. This fix ensures that the `nonsingular` function behaves as intended and resolves the bug reported in the failed test case.
