Given the details provided, it is evident that the bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of the absolute value with potentially large integer values. This results in an overflow condition, triggering the runtime warning encountered in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `maxabsvalue` calculation involves the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, which may lead to overflow for very large integer values. 

To fix the bug, the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` should be explicitly converted to floating-point numbers before taking their absolute value. Additionally, the threshold check for `maxabsvalue` should be adjusted to handle very large integer values appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Convert to float

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly converting the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` to floating-point numbers before the absolute value calculation, and adjusting the threshold check for `maxabsvalue`, the bug causing the overflow condition has been resolved. The corrected function should now handle different scenarios with input parameters more effectively and avoid the reported runtime warning.
