The error in the provided `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`, which leads to overflow issues on large negative integer values. The `abs` function encounters overflow problems when operating on such values, which results in a RuntimeWarning: "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute."

To address this issue, we need to update the code to handle large negative values and avoid the overflow problems. An alternative approach to calculate the maximum absolute value without encountering overflow issues should be implemented.

In the corrected code below, we address the overflow issue by directly comparing the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` without using the `abs` function. This approach ensures that the calculation of the maximum absolute value does not lead to overflow problems for large negative integer values. The rest of the logic in the function remains intact.

Here is the revised version of the `nonsingular` function that resolves the overflow issue:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(vmin if vmin >= 0 else -vmin, vmax if vmax >= 0 else -vmax)
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This revised version of the function uses conditional statements to directly compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` without invoking the `abs` function, thus avoiding the overflow issue. The rest of the code remains the same as the original function. This corrected version can now be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
