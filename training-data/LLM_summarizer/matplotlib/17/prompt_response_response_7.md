Based on the given information and analysis, it is evident that the bug in the `nonsingular` function is related to the overflow encountered in the calculation of the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. This occurs when the input parameters are large integer values, leading to a RuntimeWarning during the absolute value calculation.

The issue can be resolved by ensuring that the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are suitably converted to floating point numbers before applying the absolute function. This approach will mitigate the risk of encountering an overflow in operations involving potentially large integer values. Additionally, further diagnostics and testing with large integer values should be undertaken to validate the fix and ensure that the updated `nonsingular` function effectively avoids the overflow condition reported in the failed test case.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function, including the suggested fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    vmin = float(vmin)  # Convert to float to avoid overflow
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
The corrected function includes the conversion of `vmin` and `vmax` to floating point numbers at the beginning of the function, ensuring that the subsequent calculations involving their absolute values are not affected by overflow issues. This updated version of the `nonsingular` function addresses the bug related to the overflow encountered during the calculation of the absolute values and should resolve the issue reported in the failed test case.
