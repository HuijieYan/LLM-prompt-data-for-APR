As I understand, the goal of this program is to predict whether any given pair of numbers should be swapped or not. Based on the input parameters and the relevant variables at function's return, I have identified the bug and summarized it as follows:

Issue:
Looking at the input layers and nodes, it appears that there is a problem with the layer_map and tensor_map causing an inconsistent state. Since the input layers have an empty list, it might be the cause of the failure of the swap layer functionality.

Suggested Solution:
The layer_map and tensor_map need to be corrected to reflect the correct mappings between layers and tensors. This may involve a closer look at the layer and tensor assignment logic earlier in the process. Additionally, the weight initializations and input tensor mappings should also be reviewed to ensure all steps leading to the swap layer function are correct.

By resolving these issues, I believe the bug should be fixed.
