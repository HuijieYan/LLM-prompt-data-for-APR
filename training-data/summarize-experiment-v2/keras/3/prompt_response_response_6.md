The potential error location within the function seems to be in the section where it computes the output tensors and masks for the layers. This is evident from the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that the error appears when using a functional model with a layer which has more outputs without mask support, and that the `output_masks` will always be `[None]` when it is expected to be `[None, None]`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section where it computes the `output_tensors` and `output_masks` to handle cases where the layer does not support masks. We also need to ensure that the `clone_model` function correctly computes the output tensor for the model.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same as original function up to line 172)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
            if mask:  # If mask is available
                output_tensors.append(tensor * mask)
            else:
                output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output for tensor ', x)

    # Return the new model
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly handle the computation of output tensors and masks for the layers in the model.

This should fix the bug and pass the failing test case and also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
