Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function lies in the loop that computes the model outputs. Specifically, the error occurs when computing the output_masks for layers that do not support masks, leading to the AssertionError.

Bug Cause:
The issue arises from the fact that the layer.compute_mask(...) will always return None when a layer does not support masks, which leads to the error when trying to compute the output_tensors and output_masks.

Suggested Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle cases where layers do not support masks. We can add a check to see if the layer supports masks before attempting to compute them, and then appropriately handle the outputs based on the layer's capabilities.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected _clone_functional_model function

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            # Handle layers that support masks
            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                # compute masks if the layer supports it
                # ... (existing code for computing masks remains unchanged)
            else:
                # If layer does not support masks, compute output_tensors directly
                computed_tensors = []
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                for x in node.input_tensors:
                    if x in tensor_map:
                        computed_tensors.append(tensor_map[x][0])
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # no mask for layers that don't support masks

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With these modifications, the function should handle cases where layers do not support masks and compute the output_tensors accordingly.

By incorporating these changes into the _clone_functional_model function, it should successfully resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
