### 1. Analyzing the Bug

The error message "AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor" indicates that there's an issue with computing the output tensor during the model cloning process. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` demonstrates the problem when trying to clone a model with multiple outputs.

### 2. Potential Error Location

The potential error location within the `_clone_functional_model` function could be around the part where it computes the output tensors, specifically when handling multiple output tensors.

### 3. Elucidating the Bug's Cause

- The failing test passes a model with multiple outputs to the `clone_model` function.
- The error message indicates that there's an issue with computing one of the output tensors during the model cloning process.
- The failing test's input/output variable information is not directly related to the error message, but it highlights the use case of cloning models with multiple outputs.
- The GitHub issue also indicates that when using a functional model with a layer that has more than one output without mask support, the error can appear.

### 4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

- The issue appears to be related to handling multiple output tensors during the model cloning process.
- The fix might involve ensuring proper handling of multiple output tensors, especially in cases where the layer does not support masks.

### 5. Corrected Code

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function after considering the potential issues:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: keras/models.py

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    
    # Create a list of masks for the output tensors
    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)

    # Return a new Model instance reproducing the behavior of the original model
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name, masks=output_masks)
```

The corrected code adds a list `output_masks` with `None` values to ensure that proper masks are handled for the output tensors. This should address the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub issue.
