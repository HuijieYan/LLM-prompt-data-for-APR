The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the process of computing the output for layers that have multiple outputs without mask support.

The failing test code is attempting to clone a functional model with multiple outputs but is encountering an error that prevents the computation of output for a specific tensor ("swap_layer_1/Identity:0").

The corresponding error message mentions that the assertion error occurs when it tries to compute the output for the "swap_layer_1/Identity:0" tensor.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the issue arises when using a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without mask support. The issue occurs due to the Lambda layer not supporting masks, which leads to the output_masks always being None.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle cases where a layer does not support masks, and the output_masks are always None.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)
    
    # (existing code...)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # (existing code...)
                
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)  # Set output_masks to None
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                    computed_masks = [computed_mask]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)  # Set output_masks to None

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # (existing code...)
```

The updated code sets the `output_masks` to None for layers that do not support masks, addressing the issue where the `output_masks` were always None. This updated code should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case.
