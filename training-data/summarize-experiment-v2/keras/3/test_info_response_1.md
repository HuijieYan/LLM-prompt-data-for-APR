The error message indicates an `AssertionError` in the `clone_model` function of the `keras/models.py` file where it's unable to compute an output tensor. The stack trace provides details of the failing line in the failing test file and the internal function call path, which ultimately leads to the `AssertionError`.

Simplified Error:
```
AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)
```
