The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the section where it computes the output tensors for a given node. It seems that the `layer.compute_mask` function is always returning `None`, leading to an assertion error when attempting to compute the output for a specific tensor.

The failing test case is using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support, which may be triggering the error.

The corresponding GitHub issue also mentions a similar scenario, where a Lambda layer without mask support triggers the error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle cases where the layer does not support masks. Specifically, we can update the logic for computing output masks when calling the layer.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # (remaining code for traversing the nodes remains the same)

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}

            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):  # Check for mask support
                kwargs['mask'] = [x[1] for x in computed_data]  # Pass masks to layer call

            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
            tensor_map.update(zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors))  # Update tensor_map

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]  # Use updated tensor_map
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With these updates, we handle the case where the layer does not support masks by not passing masks to the layer call, and then updating the `tensor_map` with the output tensors.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post. This fix ensures that the problematic function can compute the output tensors correctly, even in scenarios where certain layers do not support masks.
