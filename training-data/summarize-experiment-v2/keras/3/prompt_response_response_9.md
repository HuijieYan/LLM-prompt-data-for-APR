Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be occurring in the `clone_model` function of `keras/models.py`. The error message "AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor" indicates that there is an issue with computing the output tensor during the model cloning process. The failing test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` also provides an example that triggers the bug by using multiple input and output tensors.

The GitHub issue title could be: "Error when using clone_model in multi_gpu_model with cpu_relocation=True"

The GitHub issue's detailed description should include the specific code snippet that triggers the issue, the relevant environment details, and a clear explanation of the observed error. It's also important to provide details about the potential cause of the bug, which in this case seems to be related to output masks not being set correctly for layers without mask support.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `clone_model` function to properly handle layers without mask support when cloning the model. This may involve checking for mask support in the layers and appropriately setting the output masks during the cloning process.

Here's the corrected code for the `clone_model` function in `keras/models.py`:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    # ... (existing code)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    output_masks = []  # New list to store output masks
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        output_masks.append(mask)  # Add output masks to the list
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name, output_masks=output_masks)  # Return output_masks as well
```

With these modifications, the corrected `clone_model` function should be able to properly compute the output tensors and masks during the cloning process, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

By implementing these changes, the failing test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` should now pass without encountering the "Could not compute output Tensor" error. Additionally, the specific use case mentioned in the GitHub issue, where `clone_model` is used in `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`, should also be resolved.
