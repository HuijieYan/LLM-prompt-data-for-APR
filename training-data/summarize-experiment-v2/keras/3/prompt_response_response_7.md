Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur while computing the output tensors for the cloned model in the `_clone_functional_model` function. Specifically, the issue arises when a layer with multiple outputs and without mask support is encountered.

Bugâ€™s Cause:
Upon examining the failing test code in `test_sequential_model.py`, it is clear that the model being cloned has a layer (`SwapLayer`) with multiple outputs and no mask support. This aligns with the information provided in the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that the error occurs when using a layer which has more outputs without mask support.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the cloning process to handle layers with multiple outputs and no mask support.
2. Ensure that when cloning a model with such layers, the output masks are handled correctly, even if they are expected to be None.

Code Correction:
Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (previous code for layer cloning remains the same)

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                # Call layer. Handle the case where mask support might be missing.
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                else:
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code includes additional handling for the case where the layer's `call` method does not support masks. It assigns `None` as the output mask in such scenarios.

This should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `clone_model` function behaves as expected.
