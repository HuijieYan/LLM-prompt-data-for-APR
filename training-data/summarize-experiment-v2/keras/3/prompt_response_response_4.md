The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the section where output masks are being computed. This aligns with the error message and the information provided in the GitHub issue. It seems that when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support, the error can appear.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the computation of the output masks for layers that don't support masks. We should also make sure that the output masks are correctly handled when there are multiple output tensors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # (Existing code remains unchanged until the following line)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # (Existing code remains unchanged until the following line)

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                kwargs['mask'] = [x[1] for x in computed_data if x[1] is not None]
            output_tensors = to_list(
                layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # The output mask is not used in the subsequent code

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue should be resolved. We have made changes to handle the computation of output masks, especially for layers that do not support masks, as described in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function is expected to pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
