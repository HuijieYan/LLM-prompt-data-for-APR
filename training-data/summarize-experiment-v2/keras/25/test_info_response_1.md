The failing test function `test_preprocess_input` failed in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function located in 'keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py'. 
The original error message was fairly technical and long, indicating that the cause was in `keras/applications/imagenet.py` and showing a complex trace at the bottom.

Simplified error message: 
```
Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'
```
