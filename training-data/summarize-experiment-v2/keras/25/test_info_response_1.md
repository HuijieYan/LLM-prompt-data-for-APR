The failing test was expecting an array of floats, but the actual function was returning a scalar array of int32. This means that the output of the function was not in the proper format according to what the test was expecting. The test error message `Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicated that there was a type casting issue while the numpy library was trying to perform subtraction on the arrays.

The simplifed error message could be:
```
Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'.
```
