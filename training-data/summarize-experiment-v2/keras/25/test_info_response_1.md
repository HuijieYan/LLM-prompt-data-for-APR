The failing test is testing a function called `test_preprocess_input`. The error occurs on line 15 of the test file, which compares the shapes of the preprocessed input array with itself.

The invocation of the `utils.preprocess_input` function results in a call to the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` file at line 178. The error is related to a UFuncTypeError, which occurs when trying to cast a ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'.

Simplified Error Message:
```
Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'
