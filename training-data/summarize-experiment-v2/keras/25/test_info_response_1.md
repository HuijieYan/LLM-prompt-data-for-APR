The error occurred in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` method within the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` module. The specific failure happened when trying to perform the `subtract` operation for the numpy array `x` at line 82. The error is a `UFuncTypeError` because it attempted to cast the output from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int32')` with casting rule `same_kind`. This was because it tried to perform a float64 operation on an int32 type of array.

The simplified error message can be stated as: 

`UFuncTypeError: Cannot perform the subtract operations for different data types float64 and int32.`
