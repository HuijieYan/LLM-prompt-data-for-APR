The issue in the code is that the mean values are not being subtracted from the input data correctly due to improper indexing. 

To fix the bug, the mean values should be subtracted from the input data using correct indexing for the channels. The corrected code snippet for this logic is as follows:

```python
# The corrected function with the bug fixed
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        # Correct mean subtraction using proper indexing
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

        if std is not None:
            for i in range(3):
                x[..., i] /= std[i]

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Correct mean subtraction using proper indexing
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

        if std is not None:
            for i in range(3):
                x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

By correcting the mean subtraction logic using proper indexing, the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should pass the failing test case.
