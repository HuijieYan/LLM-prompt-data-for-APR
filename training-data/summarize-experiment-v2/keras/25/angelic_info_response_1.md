In the given buggy function, it seems that the preprocessing logic for mode 'caffe' is incorrect. The expected output for the given input parameter values should be different. The mean values for mode 'caffe' should be used to zero-center each color channel without scaling.

To fix the function, the logic for mode 'caffe' needs to be corrected by using the mean pixel values [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] without any scaling.

After making this correction, the function should return the expected output for the given input parameter values.
