The cause of the error is that the function is attempting to perform operations on an input array of type `int32` that is not compatible with the calculations being performed. To fix this, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to a compatible type for the operations being carried out in the function.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function to explicitly cast the input array `x` to a float type before performing any arithmetic operations on it. This will ensure that the division and subtraction operations are carried out with compatible data types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

With this corrected function, the failing test (`test_preprocess_input`) should pass successfully, and the function should satisfy all the provided expected input/output variable information.
