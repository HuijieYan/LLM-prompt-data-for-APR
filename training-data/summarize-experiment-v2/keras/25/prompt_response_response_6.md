The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by performing operations that change the data type of the input array `x` without properly handling the data type. This results in a mismatch between the data type of the input and the data type of the output, leading to the error message "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'".

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations performed on `x` do not change its data type, or explicitly handle any necessary data type conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function that should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype(np.float64) / 127.5 - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype(np.float64) / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float64)
        std = None

    if mode != 'tf':
        x = x.astype(np.float64)

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    
    return x
```

This version of the function explicitly handles data type conversions using `astype(np.float64)` to ensure that the operations performed on `x` do not change its data type. It also follows the expected behavior based on the provided input/output variable information.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test `test_preprocess_input` should pass without raising any errors.
