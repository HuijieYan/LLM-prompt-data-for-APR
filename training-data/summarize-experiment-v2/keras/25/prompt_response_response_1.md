There are several issues with the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The main problem is that the function is not correctly handling the different modes and data formats. Additionally, the function does not appropriately handle the input when mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

Given the error message "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'", it seems that the function is trying to perform operations that result in a mismatch of data types, specifically between float64 and int32.

To fix the function, we need to properly handle the different modes and data formats, as well as ensure that the output data type matches the input data type.

Below is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    original_dtype = x.dtype
    x = x.astype('float32')
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        x -= mean

    return x.astype(original_dtype)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues and should now pass the failing test case.
