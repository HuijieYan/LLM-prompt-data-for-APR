## Bug cause analysis

The bug occurs when the input parameter `x` is of type `ndarray` with a floating point or integer value, and the function attempts to perform operations that result in type mismatches. This leads to a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract different data types (float64 and int32).

The bug is likely caused by inconsistencies in handling the data type of the input array `x` and the operations performed on it within the function.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug

1. Ensure that the data type of the input array `x` is consistently handled throughout the function's operations.
2. Add conditional checks to handle different data types of the input array `x` and perform appropriate operations based on its type.
3. Explicitly cast the input array `x` to a consistent data type before performing operations on it.

## Corrected code for the problematic function

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure x is of dtype float32
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # Adjust indexing for 3D array
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]  # Adjust indexing for 4D array
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    
    # Perform normalization and zero-centering
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean  # Zero-center by mean pixel
        x /= std  # Normalize each channel
    else:
        x -= mean  # Zero-center by mean pixel
        
    return x
```

By explicitly ensuring that the input array `x` is cast to `dtype=float32` and handling indexing operations appropriately, the corrected code aims to resolve the type mismatch issues and address the failing test cases.
