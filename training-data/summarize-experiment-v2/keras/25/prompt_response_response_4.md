## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by a type mismatch when performing operations on the input array `x`. The function tries to perform array operations that require float or int type elements, but the data type of `x` is not guaranteed to be float or int, leading to the `UFuncTypeError` error.

## Potential Fix
We need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a consistent data type of float before performing any arithmetic operations on it.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
One possible approach to fix the bug is to explicitly convert the input array `x` to float data type at the beginning of the function. This will ensure that all subsequent operations on `x` will be using float data type elements.

## Corrected Code
Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    # Convert input array to float type
    x = x.astype('float32')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both float and integer input arrays, and the failing test should pass.
