The bug in the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is caused by the improper mean subtraction logic. The code is currently subtracting the entire mean list from the input, when it should be subtracting each channel's mean value from the corresponding channel of the input data.

To fix the bug, the mean values should be subtracted from the input data using correct indexing for the channels. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(len(x)):
            x[:,:,:,i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[:,:,:,i] /= std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        for i in range(len(x)):
            x[:, :, :, i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, :, :, i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

The corrected code includes the necessary adjustments to properly subtract the mean values from the input data based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
