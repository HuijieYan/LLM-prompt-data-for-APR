Looking at the failing test and the error message, the issue seems to be related to the casting of types when the `mode` is set to 'caffe'. Specifically, the error message "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'" indicates that there is an issue with subtracting float values from int32 values in the code.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the condition for `mode` being 'caffe'. When `mode` is 'caffe', the function should perform specific preprocessing, including subtracting mean values from the input array `x`. However, the current implementation is not handling the casting of types correctly, leading to the error observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting of types is handled properly when performing operations on the input array `x` based on the value of `mode`. We can modify the code to explicitly cast the arrays to the correct types before performing arithmetic operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:  # mode is 'caffe'
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Explicitly cast to float
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly casts the input array `x` to float when `mode` is 'caffe', ensuring that the arithmetic operations are performed on arrays of the same type. Additionally, the code has been refactored for better readability and maintainability.

Please note that the corrected function assumes the presence of the numpy library for array manipulation.
