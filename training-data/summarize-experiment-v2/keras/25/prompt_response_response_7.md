The issue with the _preprocess_numpy_input function is that the preprocessing steps for mode 'caffe' are not being applied correctly, which is causing discrepancies in the output values. To fix this, we need to correct the preprocessing logic for mode 'caffe' by using the mean pixel values [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] without any scaling.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        return x

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    x -= mean
    return x
```

This corrected version applies the correct preprocessing steps for mode 'caffe' by using the mean pixel values without any scaling. This fix should address the discrepancies in the output values and should pass the failing test.
