The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the incorrect mean subtraction logic, which results in the improper output. The code should subtract the mean values channel-wise from the input data, but the current implementation subtracts the entire mean list from the input. This causes the output to be in the wrong format.

To fix the bug, the mean values should be subtracted from the input data using correct indexing for the channels. The correction can be achieved by iterating through the channels and subtracting the corresponding mean values from the input.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if mode == 'torch' or mode == 'caffe':
        for i in range(len(x)):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
    
    if std is not None:
        for i in range(len(x)):
            x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

This corrected function applies the mean subtraction channel-wise, as required. This ensures that the output will be in the correct format and will satisfy the expectations outlined in the failing test cases.
