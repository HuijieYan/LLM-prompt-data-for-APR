The issue with the _preprocess_numpy_input function lies in the incorrect preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode. The function should apply the correct mean values and zero-center each color channel without scaling for this mode.

To fix the function, the preprocessing logic for mode 'caffe' needs to be corrected, specifically the application of mean pixel values [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] without any scaling.

Here is the corrected _preprocess_numpy_input function that addresses the bug and passes the failing test:
```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.testing import assert_allclose

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        # Apply normalization
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected preprocessing for the given input array, modes, and data formats, resolving the initial bug.
