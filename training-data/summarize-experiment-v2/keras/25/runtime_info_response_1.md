## Expected Inputs and Outputs
Since the focus here is to reduce the input and output pairs and to make it shorter, the input/output values and types are listed below:

### Input
x (value and type): `(2, 10, 10, 3)`, `ndarray`
mode (value and type): `'caffe'`, `str`
data_format (value and type): `'channels_last'`, `str`

### Relevant variables right before the buggy function's return
Output:
mean (value and type): `[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]`, `list`

We're presenting the selected input-output pair to facilitate a better understanding and analysis to correct the implementation of the buggy function.
