Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the `_filled` variable not being set to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the `_filled` variable not updating accordingly when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow even when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
We need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, and then updates the `_filled` variable accordingly, ensuring that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread related to the markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.
