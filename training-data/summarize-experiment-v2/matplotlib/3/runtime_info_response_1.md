The provided code is the buggy function `_recache` from the file `markers.py` in the matplotlib library.

The function is intended to update the marker attributes based on the `_marker_function`, but has multiple issues that need to be addressed for it to work properly.

In Case 1, it appears that the function is not properly updating the attributes based on the `_marker_function` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.

In Case 2, the variables before the return show incorrect values for `self._path`, `self._snap_threshold`, and `self._filled`.

To fix the bug, you may need to review the logic in the `_recache` function, ensure that the marker attributes are being properly updated, and handle the condition when `self._marker_function` is `None`.

Additionally, check for any potential errors in updating the variables or setting incorrect values. This could involve checking the logic of the `_marker_function` and how it affects the marker attributes.
