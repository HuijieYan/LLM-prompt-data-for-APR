The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for setting the marker properties, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is specifically checking for the `is_filled` property of the `MarkerStyle` class. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is causing the test to fail.

Upon analyzing the input/output variable information and the expected input/output variable information, it is clear that the bug is related to the `_filled` property not being set correctly in the `_recache` function. The expected value of `_filled` is `True` while the actual value is `False`.

The GitHub issue describes the problem accurately, where the user is expecting to set markers as hollow by using `fillstyle='none'`, but it's not working.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` property should be set to the opposite of `self._filled` when `self._fillstyle` is 'none' in the `_recache` function.

The corrected code for `_recache` function would be:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on _fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the Github issue should be resolved as well.

By making this change, the markers will correctly be filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` parameter when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'.
