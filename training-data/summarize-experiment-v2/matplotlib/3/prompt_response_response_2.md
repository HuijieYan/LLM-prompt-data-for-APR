The issue with the current implementation of the _recache function is that it is not properly updating the marker attributes based on the _marker_function. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the values of certain attributes such as self._path, self._snap_threshold, and self._filled.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly updates the marker attributes based on the _marker_function, and that the attributes are initialized to the correct values before calling the marker function.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = 1.0
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```
By initializing the marker attributes properly and ensuring that the _marker_function is called only when it is not None, this corrected version of the _recache function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

Additionally, this will update the marker attributes as expected when setting markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle parameter to 'none' and will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Remember to make the necessary adjustments to the imports and the overall structure of the file in the matplotlib library.
