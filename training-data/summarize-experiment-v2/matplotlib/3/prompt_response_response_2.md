## Issue Analysis
The issue is that the marker is not appearing hollow when setting the fillstyle to 'none' in a costumed MarkerStyle.

### Error Location
The potential error in the code is the `_filled` variable being set to `False` instead of `True`.

### Bug Cause
The issue is likely due to the `_filled` variable being set to `False`, which would cause the marker to be filled, even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is consistent with the error message and the discrepancy between the expected and actual values of `_filled`.

### Possible Approaches
To fix the bug, the code should set the `_filled` variable to `True` when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the fillstyle, the corrected code should now correctly reflect the desired behavior and pass the failing test.
