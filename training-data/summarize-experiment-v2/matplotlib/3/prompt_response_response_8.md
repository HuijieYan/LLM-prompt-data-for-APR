The issue described seems to be that the markers are not hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' when creating a custom MarkerStyle and using it with ax.scatter(). This could be due to the 'filled' attribute not being properly set to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the line `self._filled = True`, which should be set to False when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug could be identified as:
(a). The buggy function: _recache sets _filled to True unconditionally.
(b). The buggy class docs: The MarkerStyle class should take the fillstyle parameter into account when setting the filled attribute.
(c). The failing test: This test is focused on the behavior of the fillstyle, which suggests there is some issue with the filled attribute.
(d). The corresponding error message: The error message shows that the marker is considered filled when it should not be, which is why the failing assert statement exists.
(e). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value: The actual _filled attribute value remains True despite the fillstyle being set to 'none'.
(f). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value: The expected input/output variable information indicates that _filled should be set to False when fillstyle is 'none'.
(g). The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem and a reproduction code.

To resolve this issue, the `self._filled` attribute should be set to False when the `self._fillstyle` is 'none'. Additionally, the `_alt_path` and `_alt_transform` should be set to None to indicate that there is no alternative path and transform for the marker style.

Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code for the _recache function should properly handle the fillstyle 'none' case and ensure that the marker is not filled when used with ax.scatter(). This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post as well as pass the failing test case.
