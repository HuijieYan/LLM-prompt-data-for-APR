Potential error location:
The issue seems to be that the `_filled` attribute is being incorrectly set to `False` instead of `True` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the marker to not be hollow as expected.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This behavior is not consistent with the user's expectations and is likely causing confusion and issues for users who want to create hollow markers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.
2. Use the `fillstyle` parameter to determine whether the marker should be filled or not, and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` value, allowing the markers to be correctly filled or hollow based on user expectations.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
