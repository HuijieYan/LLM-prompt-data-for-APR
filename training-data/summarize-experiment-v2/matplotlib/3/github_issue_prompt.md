GitHub Bug Title:
TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype

Description:
Using the new nullable integer data type, calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError. It works with int64 dtype and also with Int64 dtype when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy. The error occurs with median and std as well. However, it does not occur with min, max, or first.

Expected Output:
When performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of nullable integer data type (Int64), the following behaviours are expected for the specified methods:
mean(): The method should compute the mean of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
median():The method should compute the median of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
std(): The method should compute the standard deviation of grouped data without raising a TypeError.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
The markers are not hollow when I use ax.scatter() and set markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. My usage is wrong?
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a costomed markers.MarkerStyle and set the paramter fillstyle='none'. But I don't get what I want.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np
xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
