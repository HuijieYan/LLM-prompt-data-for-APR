```python
# The corrected version of the function
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
The issue with the original code is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected. To resolve the issue, we should set `self._filled` to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

With the corrected function, the failing test would pass, and the markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none`. Additionally, the GitHub issue will also be resolved.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = None
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
