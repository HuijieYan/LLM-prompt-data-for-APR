Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue in the code lies in the _recache function, where the initial value of self._filled is set to True even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function does not handle the case where fillstyle is set to 'none' properly, leading to the marker being filled despite the expectation that it should be hollow.
(b) The behavior is contrary to the expectation set in the failing test, which expects the marker to be hollow.

Suggested possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle.
2. Update the _recache function to handle the 'none' fillstyle properly.

A corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    # Handle the fillstyle 'none' to set filled to False
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the marker should be hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. This will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
