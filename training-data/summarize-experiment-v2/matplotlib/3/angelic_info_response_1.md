Based on the expected value and type of variables, the _recache function should initialize several attributes of the object before calling the marker function. The expected values for the attributes include path, snap_threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled. These attributes should be set to specific values or objects before calling the marker function.

Given that the function does not take any input parameters, it is essential to ensure that the attributes are correctly initialized. If any of these attributes are not properly set, the function will not work as expected when called.
