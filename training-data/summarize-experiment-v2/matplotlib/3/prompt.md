Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

```python

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The provided code is the buggy function `_recache` from the file `markers.py` in the matplotlib library.

The function is intended to update the marker attributes based on the `_marker_function`, but has multiple issues that need to be addressed for it to work properly.

In Case 1, it appears that the function is not properly updating the attributes based on the `_marker_function` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.

In Case 2, the variables before the return show incorrect values for `self._path`, `self._snap_threshold`, and `self._filled`.

To fix the bug, you may need to review the logic in the `_recache` function, ensure that the marker attributes are being properly updated, and handle the condition when `self._marker_function` is `None`.

Additionally, check for any potential errors in updating the variables or setting incorrect values. This could involve checking the logic of the `_marker_function` and how it affects the marker attributes.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the expected value and type of variables, the _recache function should initialize several attributes of the object before calling the marker function. The expected values for the attributes include path, snap_threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled. These attributes should be set to specific values or objects before calling the marker function.

Given that the function does not take any input parameters, it is essential to ensure that the attributes are correctly initialized. If any of these attributes are not properly set, the function will not work as expected when called.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Markers are not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'.

Description:
When setting markers to be hollow by using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle parameter to 'none', the desired effect is not achieved. Instead, the markers appear filled. 

Reproduction Steps:
1. Import required modules
2. Create random data for scatter plot
3. Use ax.scatter() and markers.MarkerStyle to set markers hollow
4. Display the plot using plt.show()

Expected Output:
The markers should appear hollow when setting markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle parameter to 'none'.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- numpy: 1.18.1
