The bug in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the markers not to be hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'. This is evident from the failing test, which checks if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns False when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it returns True instead.

The potential error location within the `_recache` function, where the `_filled` attribute is being set to True, regardless of the `fillstyle` being 'none'.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to True in the `_recache` function, which is causing it to always be set to True, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False, and True otherwise.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the failing test should pass and the markers should be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resolving the issue posted on GitHub.

The GitHub issue title for this bug can be: "Markers not hollow when setting fillstyle to 'none' in matplotlib scatter plot using MarkerStyle."

The GitHub issue's detailed description can include the code for reproduction and a brief description of the bug, similar to the following:
```
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a custom MarkerStyle and set the parameter fillstyle='none'. But the markers are not hollow as expected. Here's a code for reproduction:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np

xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
```
