The potential error in the `_recache` function could be related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` when updating the marker attributes based on the `_marker_function`. It seems that the `fillstyle` of 'none' is not being properly accounted for, leading to the markers appearing filled instead of hollow.

The cause of the bug can be identified by examining the failing test, which expects the markers to be hollow when setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none', but the test fails due to the markers being filled. This discrepancy is related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that it sets the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

The updated version of the `_recache` function now correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter by setting the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is 'none'. This change ensures that the failing test passes and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
