Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the `_filled` variable, which is being set to `False` by default. However, when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`, we would expect `_filled` to be `True` rather than `False`.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the expectation is that the marker should be hollow. However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix this bug would be to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` variable should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is hollow. Additionally, any other relevant attributes should be updated to reflect the change in fill style.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated `_recache` function now checks the value of `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

By making this change, the markers should now be hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` while using `ax.scatter()`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
