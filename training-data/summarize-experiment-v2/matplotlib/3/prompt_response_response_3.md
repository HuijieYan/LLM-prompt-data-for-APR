The buggy function `_recache` from the `MarkerStyle` class in the file `markers.py` has multiple issues that need to be addressed. It is failing to properly update the marker attributes based on the `_marker_function`, and various variables are not being properly initialized.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to properly set the attributes and call the `_marker_function` if it is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = 1.0
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        self._path = None
        self._transform = None
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

This version of the function checks if the `_marker_function` is not None before updating the attributes and calling the function. Otherwise, it sets the attributes to their default values.

This fix should address the issues with the `_recache` function and ensure that the marker attributes are properly updated based on the `_marker_function`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
