The issue appears to be that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle` class, the markers are not rendered as hollow. This is contrary to the expected behavior where setting `fillstyle` to 'none' should make the markers appear hollow.

The potential error location within the `MarkerStyle` class is likely the `_recache` method. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of making the markers hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug can be identified through the following:
(a). The buggy function: The `_recache` method unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`.
(b). The class docs: The class documentation should outline the behavior of the `fillstyle` attribute in relation to the `MarkerStyle` appearance.
(c). The failing test: The failing test is trying to verify that `is_filled()` returns `False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
(d). The corresponding error message: The error message indicates that the assertion for `not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing.
(e). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value: The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` when it should be `False`.
(f). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value: The expected value of `_filled` should be `False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
(g). The GitHub Issue information: The issue details the incorrect behavior when setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should check the value of `fillstyle` before setting the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` should be set to `False`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `MarkerStyle._recache` is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `MarkerStyle` class should correctly honor the `fillstyle` attribute, and the markers should appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This fix should address the issue reported on the GitHub thread.
