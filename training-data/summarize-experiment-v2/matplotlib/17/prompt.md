def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` calls a function `nonsingular()` that returns floating-point numbers. The `nonsingular` function checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not a finite number, and then returns values between `-expander` and `expander`. However, the code contains a subtle bug in the condition when `maxabsvalue` being smaller than a specific value caused a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. This is because of the subtraction and absolute functions that exceed the available numerical range and thus result in an overflow. A possible fix for the issue would require code changes within the `nonsingular` function to handle these edge cases such that the result does not overflow.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It handles various edge cases and conditions to ensure that the endpoints are valid and non-singular.

After reviewing the input and output values for the failing tests, several issues have been identified:

1. In Case 1, the swap condition is handled incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. In Case 2, the condition for expanding the range based on `tiny` is not functioning as expected. This leads to an incorrect value for `maxabsvalue`.
3. In Case 3, similar to Case 1, the swap condition leads to incorrect results for `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. Case 4 is not covered in the provided output values, but it seems to be an edge case related to infinite values.
5. In Case 5, while the input values are handled correctly, the condition for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` based on `tiny` is not working as expected.
6. Cases 6 and 7 seem to have similar issues with handling edge case conditions.
7. Case 8 is similar to Case 6 and 7, where the conditions for handling edge cases are not functioning correctly.

To address these issues, the relevant conditions in the `nonsingular` function need to be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that the endpoints are correctly adjusted based on the provided constraints and edge cases. Additionally, the swapping logic for `vmin` and `vmax` needs to be checked for correctness.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the first and second cases, the `swapped` variable is expected to be `False` and the `maxabsvalue` variable should be set to 1. In the third case, the `swapped` variable should be `True`, and the `vmin` and `vmax` values should be swapped accordingly. In the fourth case, if either of the input parameters is infinite, the function should return `-expander` and `expander`.

The function should also handle scenarios where the interval is very small and needs to be expanded. The function should correctly update the `vmin` and `vmax` values according to the logic provided in the function's docstring.
