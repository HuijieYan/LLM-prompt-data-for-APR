Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The original error messages mention that a RuntimeWarning related to overflow was encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute:

    * In the case "clim = (-20000, 20000)", it stated:
      `E       RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`
      "lib/matplotlib/transforms.py:2799: RuntimeWarning"
 
    * In the case "clim = (-32768, 0)", it stated:
      `E       RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`
      "lib/matplotlib/transforms.py:2794: RuntimeWarning"

Here's a simplified version of the error messages that points to the source of the problem:
  
    * The "clim = (-20000, 20000)" case had the warning about overflow during scalar subtraction.
  
    * The "clim = (-32768, 0)" case had the warning about overflow during scalar absolute.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug appears to be related to the logic of the function that is supposed to transform input parameters vmin and vmax to positive values while keeping track of any changes through the swapped variable. Looking at the discrepancies between the input parameters and the variables right before the return in failing cases, it seems that the logic for transforming the input parameters is flawed, leading to incorrect values for the transformed variables. This discrepancy ultimately causes the function to fail its test cases.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug lies in the transformation logic of the input parameters. The transformation logic does not consistently and correctly handle the transformation of the input parameters, which leads to incorrect values for the transformed variables and ultimately causes the test cases to fail.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

### Summary of Discrepancy
The discrepancy in the failing test cases seems to be related to how the function handles the vmin and vmax values, as well as the calculation of the maxabsvalue.

In the third test case, the function fails to correctly handle the scenario where vmin is greater than vmax, resulting in the "swapped" variable not being set to True and the "maxabsvalue" not being calculated correctly.

This discrepancy suggests that the core logic of the function does not properly handle the scenario where the vmin and vmax values are swapped. This issue likely leads to incorrect results and failing test cases.


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, the expected input/output variable information, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The failing test
   (c). The corresponding error message
   (d). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value
   (e). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
   (b). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
