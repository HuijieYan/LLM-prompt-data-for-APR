The bug seems to be related to potential overflow issues when calculating the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax`. This is indicated by the runtime warning about overflow encountered in scalar subtract. The error occurs when the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is calculated and can lead to invalid results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `nonsingular` function to handle cases where overflow might occur. Specifically, we can add checks to ensure that the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` does not lead to an overflow. Additionally, we can handle cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are at the limits of their types (e.g., int16) to prevent overflow errors.

Here's a corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if np.isinf(diff) or np.isnan(diff):
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these modifications, the function should handle potential overflow issues and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
