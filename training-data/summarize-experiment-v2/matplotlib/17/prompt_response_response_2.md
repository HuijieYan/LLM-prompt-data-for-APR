Based on the failing test and error message, the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the vmin and vmax values, as well as the calculation of the maxabsvalue. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the scenario where the vmin and vmax values are swapped, which likely leads to incorrect results and failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to address the transformation logic of the input parameters and ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where the vmin and vmax values are swapped.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= (maxabsvalue * tiny):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
