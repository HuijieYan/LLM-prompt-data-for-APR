The potential error in the `nonsingular` function is related to the conditions for swapping `vmin` and `vmax`, as well as the logic for expanding the range based on the `tiny` threshold. These conditions are not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect output values and triggering overflow errors. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and logic for handling these cases.

One approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditions for swapping and expanding the range in the `nonsingular` function. By adjusting these conditions and ensuring that the swapping and expanding logic works correctly, we can address the issues observed in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The updated function resolves the issues with swapping and range expansion by addressing the specific conditions and logic. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
