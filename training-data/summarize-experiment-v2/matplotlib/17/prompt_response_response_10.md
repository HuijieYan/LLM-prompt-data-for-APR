The issue in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to overflow problems occurring during scalar subtraction. The function checks for finite input values and then performs some calculations that can lead to overflow warnings. This is consistent with the error message encountered in the failing test.

One of the potential error locations within the function is the calculation of `vmax - vmin` and the subsequent operations based on this difference. This is likely where the overflow issues are arising.

To fix this bug, you can consider adjusting the logic around the calculation of `vmax - vmin` and the subsequent conditional checks. You may also need to adjust the logic around the checks for finite input values.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    diff = abs(vmax - vmin)
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code should resolve the overflow issues and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
