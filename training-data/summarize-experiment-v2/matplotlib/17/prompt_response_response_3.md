The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to overflow problems when working with large values. This causes a runtime warning when `vmax` subtracts `vmin`. 

To fix the bug, you can modify the `nonsingular` function to handle large values appropriately. One approach is to check if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too large, and if so, adjust the values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    diff = vmax - vmin
    if abs(diff) > 1e6:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code checks the absolute difference between `vmin` and `vmax` and adjusts the values if the difference is too large, preventing overflow problems. This should resolve the runtime warning and ensure that the function works correctly with large values.
