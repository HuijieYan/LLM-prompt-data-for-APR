The bug in the `nonsingular` function is that it doesn't handle the scenario where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` correctly. This causes the `swapped` variable to not be set to `True` and the `maxabsvalue` to be calculated incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the scenario where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` and calculate the `maxabsvalue` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version properly handles the scenario where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` and calculates the `maxabsvalue` accordingly. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
