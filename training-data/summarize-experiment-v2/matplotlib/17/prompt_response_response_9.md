The buggy function `nonsingular` has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The swapping condition is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. The condition for expanding the range based on `tiny` is not functioning as expected, resulting in incorrect values for `maxabsvalue`.
3. Handling of infinite input values does not match the expected behavior.

To fix these issues, the following approaches can be considered:

1. Correct the swapping logic to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are correctly adjusted.
2. Update the condition for expanding the range based on `tiny` to calculate `maxabsvalue` correctly.
3. Adjust the handling of infinite input values to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
