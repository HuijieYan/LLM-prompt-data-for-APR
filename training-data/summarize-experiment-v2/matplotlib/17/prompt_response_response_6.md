The potential problem location within the function is the logic for handling the scenario where the `vmin` is greater than `vmax`. This is indicated by the "swapped" variable not being set to True and the "maxabsvalue" not being calculated correctly.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the scenario where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` needs to be adjusted to correctly set the "swapped" variable and calculate the "maxabsvalue".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin or not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
