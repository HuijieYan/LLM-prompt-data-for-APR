The `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It handles various edge cases and conditions to ensure that the endpoints are valid and non-singular.

After reviewing the input and output values for the failing tests, several issues have been identified:

1. In Case 1, the swap condition is handled incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. In Case 2, the condition for expanding the range based on `tiny` is not functioning as expected. This leads to an incorrect value for `maxabsvalue`.
3. In Case 3, similar to Case 1, the swap condition leads to incorrect results for `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. Case 4 is not covered in the provided output values, but it seems to be an edge case related to infinite values.
5. In Case 5, while the input values are handled correctly, the condition for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` based on `tiny` is not working as expected.
6. Cases 6 and 7 seem to have similar issues with handling edge case conditions.
7. Case 8 is similar to Case 6 and 7, where the conditions for handling edge cases are not functioning correctly.

To address these issues, the relevant conditions in the `nonsingular` function need to be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that the endpoints are correctly adjusted based on the provided constraints and edge cases. Additionally, the swapping logic for `vmin` and `vmax` needs to be checked for correctness.
