The bug appears to be related to the logic of the function that is supposed to transform input parameters vmin and vmax to positive values while keeping track of any changes through the swapped variable. Looking at the discrepancies between the input parameters and the variables right before the return in failing cases, it seems that the logic for transforming the input parameters is flawed, leading to incorrect values for the transformed variables. This discrepancy ultimately causes the function to fail its test cases.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug lies in the transformation logic of the input parameters. The transformation logic does not consistently and correctly handle the transformation of the input parameters, which leads to incorrect values for the transformed variables and ultimately causes the test cases to fail.
