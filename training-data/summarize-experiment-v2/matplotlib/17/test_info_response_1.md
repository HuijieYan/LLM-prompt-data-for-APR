The failing test `test_colorbar_int` calls a function `nonsingular()` that returns floating-point numbers. The `nonsingular` function checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not a finite number, and then returns values between `-expander` and `expander`. However, the code contains a subtle bug in the condition when `maxabsvalue` being smaller than a specific value caused a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. This is because of the subtraction and absolute functions that exceed the available numerical range and thus result in an overflow. A possible fix for the issue would require code changes within the `nonsingular` function to handle these edge cases such that the result does not overflow.
