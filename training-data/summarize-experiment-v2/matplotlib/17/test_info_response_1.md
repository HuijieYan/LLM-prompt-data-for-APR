Based on the bug on the non-singular function in the transforms module of matplotlib, it seems that the error might be related to overflow problems on the absolute function. If `vmax` subtracts `vmin`, a runtime warning says an overflow occurs, this suggests the overflow encountered in scalar subtract problems is in the `nonsingular()` function.
 
The relevant simplified error message from test_colorbar_int:
```
RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract
```
This message appeared on line 2811 in the transforms.py module.

In the failing test, test_colorbar_int, the user sets a parameter `clim` to `(-20000, 20000)` and `(-32768, 0)`. However, these clim values cause the runtime warnings at the `nonsingular` function.
