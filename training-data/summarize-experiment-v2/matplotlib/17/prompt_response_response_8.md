The buggy function `nonsingular` contains a few issues related to handling edge cases and swapping of vmin and vmax. The function fails to handle cases where the interval is very small and needs to be expanded and the swapping logic is inconsistent.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The condition for handling edge case when `maxabsvalue` is smaller than a specific value.
2. The swapping logic that needs to be checked for correctness.

The cause of the bug is identified as:
(a). The buggy function `nonsingular`
(b). The failing test `test_colorbar_int`
(c). The errors "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute"
(d). The discrepancies between the actual input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values indicate that the function fails to correctly expand and swap the vmin and vmax values in certain edge cases.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Correct the conditions for handling edge cases related to `maxabsvalue`.
2. Review and fix the swapping logic for `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif (not increasing) and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
