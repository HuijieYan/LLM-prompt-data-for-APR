The issue appears to be related to the potential for overflow problems when calculating the absolute value in the `nonsingular` function. This is supported by the runtime warning about an overflow encountered in scalar subtraction.

The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities, and it includes logic to handle scenarios such as non-finite inputs, interval size, and swapping endpoints if necessary. However, it seems that there are cases where the logic for adjusting the endpoints is causing overflow issues, particularly when dealing with large numbers or when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is very small.

To address this issue, one possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for adjusting the endpoints in the `nonsingular` function. This could involve implementing checks to prevent potential overflow issues, such as avoiding absolute value calculations that may lead to overflow, or adjusting the interval expansion strategy to avoid excessively large adjustments.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function that addresses the potential overflow issue and satisfies the expected input/output variable information:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Ensure that vmax is greater than or equal to vmin
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval_size = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # Adjust endpoints if the interval is too small based on the tiny threshold
    if interval_size <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            adjustment = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= adjustment
            vmax += adjustment

    # Swap vmin and vmax if required
    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should address the potential overflow issues and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
