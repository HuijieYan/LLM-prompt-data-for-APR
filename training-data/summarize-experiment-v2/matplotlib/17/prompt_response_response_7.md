Based on the given information, the potential error in the buggy function appears to be related to the calculation of absolute values and potential overflows. The function `nonsingular` aims to modify endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, and it seems that for certain input values, the absolute value calculation and subsequent operations are leading to overflow errors.

To fix the bug, you can consider the following approaches:
1. Use floating-point arithmetic for absolute value calculations and comparisons to avoid overflow errors.
2. Implement checks for extreme input values to prevent overflow situations.
3. Handle the case of extreme input values such as `-inf` and `inf` appropriately to avoid runtime warnings and overflows.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function considering the above approaches:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function applies the suggested approaches to handle extreme input values and prevent overflow errors. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
