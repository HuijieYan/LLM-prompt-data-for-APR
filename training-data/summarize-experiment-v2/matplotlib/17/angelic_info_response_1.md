In the first and second cases, the `swapped` variable is expected to be `False` and the `maxabsvalue` variable should be set to 1. In the third case, the `swapped` variable should be `True`, and the `vmin` and `vmax` values should be swapped accordingly. In the fourth case, if either of the input parameters is infinite, the function should return `-expander` and `expander`.

The function should also handle scenarios where the interval is very small and needs to be expanded. The function should correctly update the `vmin` and `vmax` values according to the logic provided in the function's docstring.
