The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It seems that the calculation of the variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, `is_decorator`, and `self.previous_defs` is not aligning with the expected values, leading to the failing test and the assertion error.

Upon analysis, it appears that the issue may be related to the logic and condition checks within the function. The conditions for adjusting the variables may not be correctly capturing the intended behavior, leading to incorrect values being assigned to these variables.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Review and verify the condition checks within the function to ensure that they accurately represent the intended logic for adjusting the variables.
2. Reassess how the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` are calculated and assigned.
3. Verify the usage of `self.previous_defs` and ensure that it is updated and used appropriately.
4. Ensure that the function accounts for all the different cases and conditions accurately to calculate the correct number of empty lines before and after the processed line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for calculating the variables has been adjusted based on the expected input/output value information provided. This code aims to align with the intended behavior described in the problem and should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
