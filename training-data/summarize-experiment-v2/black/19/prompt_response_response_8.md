It seems that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The function relies on the `current_line` object and makes decisions based on its type and relationship with the previous line.

Potential issues could stem from the conditional logic within the function, which may not be correctly handling the different cases and relationships between the current and previous lines.

To resolve this issue, the conditional statements within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function need to be carefully reviewed and possibly modified to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned for each scenario. Additionally, the related functions and class methods should be reviewed to ensure that the correct information is being passed to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

One potential approach to fixing the bug could involve refactoring the conditional logic within the function and adding additional checks to properly handle the different cases and relationships with the previous line.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ... (other class methods)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```
This corrected version of the function aims to address the potential issues and aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.
