Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic related to the `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, `is_decorator`, and `self.previous_defs` variables. It seems that the current logic is not producing the expected output in certain scenarios, leading to the failing test case.

The bug's cause may be related to the incorrect handling of conditions and variables in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It seems that the function is not correctly determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic related to determining the `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, `is_decorator`, and `self.previous_defs` variables and ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior.
2. Checking conditional statements to ensure that they are correctly considering the input parameters and previous state.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above changes, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.
