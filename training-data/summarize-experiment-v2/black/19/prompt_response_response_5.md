Based on the provided information, the issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of conditions such as `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and the `self.previous_defs` list. These discrepancies are likely causing the function to return incorrect values for the number of empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing and updating the conditional statements in the function to ensure that the calculations for `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and the `self.previous_defs` list are consistent with the expected behavior.
2. Adding or updating unit tests to cover the various scenarios and ensure that the function returns the expected number of empty lines for different types of lines and their relationships with the previous line.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, incorporating the suggested fixes:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            if depth == 0:
                before = 2
            else:
                before = 1
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues identified and ensure that the function returns the expected number of empty lines for different scenarios. Additionally, it should pass the failing test case provided.
