The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely caused by a logical error or incorrect variable manipulation. It's attempting to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Based on the provided information, the bug seems to cause an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual outputs of the failing test.

To fix the bug, you might consider re-evaluating the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines. It's important to ensure that the conditions and calculations are correctly handled to produce the expected results.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected version should fix the logical issues in the previous version of the function and should now produce the correct results for the given inputs.

You can use this corrected function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
