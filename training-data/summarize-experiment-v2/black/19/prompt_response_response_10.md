The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. From the given input/output value pairs, it appears that the issue lies in the incorrect computation of `max_allowed`, `before`, `depth`, and certain conditional checks.

The failing test is asserting that the expected result does not match the actual result. It seems that the function is either inserting or not inserting empty lines in the wrong places, resulting in a discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

The potential error locations within the function could be the conditional checks and the computations of `max_allowed` and `before`, as well as the manipulation of `self.previous_defs`.

To fix the bug, we can consider the following approaches:
1. Review the conditional checks and ensure that the correct logic is applied for inserting empty lines based on different line types.
2. Check the computation of `max_allowed` and `before` to ensure that they align with the expected behavior.
3. Verify the manipulation of `self.previous_defs` to guarantee that it tracks the previous line depth correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code incorporates the logic adjustments based on the input/output value pairs and should address the issues identified. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
