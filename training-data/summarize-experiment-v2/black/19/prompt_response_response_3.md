The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` arises from an incorrect comparison of the `is_decorator` attribute with the `current_line.depth` attribute. When the function checks if `current_line.is_decorator` is False, it should also be checking if `current_line.depth` is 0. However, in some cases, `current_line.depth` is not considered when making this comparison, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to include the `current_line.depth` attribute in the comparison with `is_decorator`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator or current_line.depth == 0:  # Fix the comparison
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected function, the comparison logic for `is_decorator` and `current_line.depth` has been updated to fix the bug. Now, the function should provide the correct return values and pass the failing test cases.
