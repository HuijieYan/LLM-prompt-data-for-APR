Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is the conditional statements and variable assignments that determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of line types and relationships with the previous line.

The bug's cause is likely the incorrect assignment of values to `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and `self.previous_defs` based on the type of the current line and its relationship with the previous line. This is leading to discrepancies between the actual and expected output variable values.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and variable assignments in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function need to be carefully reviewed and modified to align with the expected outputs for different cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues in the original `_maybe_empty_lines` function and provides a fixed implementation that is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
