The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the class `EmptyLineTracker` and uses various related functions like `is_import`, `is_decorator`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the potential error within the problematic function could be related to the initialization of the `max_allowed` variable and how it is being used to determine the value of `before`. Additionally, the logic for updating the `before` variable in the while loop could be causing unexpected behaviors.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect assignment and handling of the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `self.previous_defs`, which leads to discrepancies between actual input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Adjust the logic for initializing and updating the `max_allowed` variable based on the conditions involving `current_line.depth`.
2. Refine the logic for updating the `before` variable within the while loop to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
            
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This correction adjusts the initialization and usage of the `max_allowed` and `before` variables to align with the expected behavior and resolves the discrepancies between the actual input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values.
