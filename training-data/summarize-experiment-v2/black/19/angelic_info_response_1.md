Understood! Based on the input and the expected value and type of variables listed, it seems that the key variables being considered for correction are `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, `is_decorator`, and `self.previous_defs`. These variables must be adjusted in order to match the expected output. Thank you for providing the expected input and output value pair.
