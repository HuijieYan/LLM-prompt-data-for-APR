Summary:
The failing test cases are checking for the expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return. The variables include max_allowed, first_leaf, before, depth, is_decorator, and newlines. The issue seems to be related to the manipulation and calculation of these variables within the function logic. Analyzing and debugging the function's core logic that handles these variables should help in identifying the discrepancies and fixing the failing test cases.
