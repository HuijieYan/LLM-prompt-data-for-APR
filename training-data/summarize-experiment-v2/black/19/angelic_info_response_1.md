In the given source code, there is a function named `_maybe_empty_lines` inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function adjusts the number of empty lines before each line in the file based on certain conditions.

The function takes a `current_line` object as input, which contains information about the current line of code. Based on the type of line (e.g., decorator, flow control, import, yield, etc.) and the relationship of the current line with the previous line, the function calculates the number of empty lines that should precede the current line.

The function contains multiple conditions and adjustments to `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and the `self.previous_defs` list based on the type of line and the relationship with the previous line.

However, based on the provided expected value and type of variables for different cases, it seems that the function is not working as expected. For example, in case 3, the `max_allowed` is not being set as expected, and in case 7, the `self.previous_defs` list is not updated as expected.

To resolve these issues, the conditions in the function need to be thoroughly evaluated and modified to align with the expected outputs for different cases. Additionally, unit tests may need to be added or modified to ensure the correct behavior of the function for different scenarios.
