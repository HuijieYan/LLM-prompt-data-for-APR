### Bug in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided information, the potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the computation of the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and the handling of `self.previous_defs`.

The expected behavior and the actual behavior do not match for the given input, and the function is not producing the correct output. This discrepancy is leading to the failed test case.

### Bug Cause

The potential cause of the bug is an incorrect computation of the variables `max_allowed` and `before`, as well as the handling of `self.previous_defs`. These incorrect computations are leading to the discrepancy between expected and actual output values.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Initialize `max_allowed` and `before` with proper default values before the conditional checks.
2. Adjust the computation logic for `max_allowed` and `before` based on the conditions and input parameters.
3. Ensure that the handling of `self.previous_defs` is correctly updating and accessing the depth values.

### Corrected Code

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    else:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.
