The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be misinterpreting or miscalculating the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line based on certain conditions and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. These miscalculations are leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being added, causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect computation of the `before` variable and its utilization in determining the number of extra empty lines to be added. The conditionals and calculations in the function seem to be leading to incorrect results.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would involve revisiting the conditions that determine the number of empty lines to be added. Ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is being calculated and returned based on these conditions can resolve the issue.

The corrected version of the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function should now handle the conditions correctly and output the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
