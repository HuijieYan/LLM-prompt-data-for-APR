Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may be related to the calculation of the `before` variable and the handling of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `depth`. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output, particularly with regards to the number of empty lines before and after certain lines.

Potential bug causes:
1. The calculation of `before` based on `max_allowed` and the number of newlines in the prefix may not be correct.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for calculating the `before` variable based on the `max_allowed` value and the presence of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf.
2. Adjust how `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `depth` are used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Given these considerations, here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected code adjusts the calculation of `before` and updates the logic for handling different line types and their corresponding empty line requirements. Additionally, the return values are adjusted based on the expected behavior provided.

This corrected code should address the bug and make the `_maybe_empty_lines` function pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
