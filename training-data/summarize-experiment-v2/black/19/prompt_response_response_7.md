Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The conditions and adjustments within the function need to be carefully evaluated and modified to ensure the correct behavior for different scenarios.

One potential approach for fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is to review and update the logic within the function, ensuring that the `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and the `self.previous_defs` list are updated and adjusted appropriately based on the type of line and its relationship with the previous line. Additionally, thorough unit testing should be conducted to validate the correct behavior of the function for various cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The corrected code for the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues identified and ensure the correct behavior of the function based on the expected input/output variable information provided. It is intended to pass the failing test and align with the expected functionality of the function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
