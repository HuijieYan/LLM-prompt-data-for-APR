The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is trying to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are multiple issues in the code that are causing it to produce incorrect results. Here are the main problems:

1. The logic for updating the `before` variable and the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` seems incorrect and needs to be re-evaluated.
2. The conditions like `return (before or 1), 0` and `return (before or 1), 0` are not handling the cases properly.

To fix the function, we need to revisit and rewrite the entire logic to properly handle all the cases and conditions. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    result = (0, 0)

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return (0, 0)
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return (0, 0)

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        result = (newlines, 0)
    else:
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            result = (before, 1)
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            result = (before or 1, 0)
        elif (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and not current_line.is_yield
            or depth != self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            result = (before or 1, 0)
        else:
            result = (before, 0)

    return result
```

This corrected version should properly handle all the cases and conditions, and it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
