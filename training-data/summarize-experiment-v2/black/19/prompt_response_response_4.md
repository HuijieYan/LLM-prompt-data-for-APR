Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are discrepancies in the behavior of the function and the expected outputs for different cases.

The potential error locations within the function may be the conditions that update variables such as `max_allowed`, `before`, `newlines`, and `self.previous_defs`.

The cause of the bug may be related to incorrect updates to these variables based on the type of line and its relationship with the previous line.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
1. Reviewing and modifying the conditions within the function to align with the expected outputs for different types of lines.
2. Adding or modifying unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the function for different scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

The corrected function aligns with the expected behavior and should pass the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
