The original error message is quite lengthy and includes information related to the failure but also has several unnecessary details. 

The error message indicates a specific assertion failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the `BlackTestCase`. 

It compares the expected and actual values of a particular test and shows the difference between them, including specific lines of code where the differences occur.

Based on the error message, the failing test is `test_comment_in_decorator`, and the specific assertion failure is in the `assertFormatEqual` method in the `test_black.py` file on line 100, showing the differing portions of the expected and actual values.

To simplify the error message:
- The failing test scenario is `test_comment_in_decorator`.
- The assertion failure occurs in the `assertFormatEqual` method within the `test_black.py` file on line 100.
- The error message specifically shows the expected and actual values and highlights the differences between the two.
