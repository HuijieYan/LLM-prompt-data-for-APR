The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an assertion error in the test_comment_in_decorator test case. This assertion error is triggered when comparing the expected output with the actual output. The error message indicates a difference in the number of newlines produced in the output.

The expected output contains empty lines at specific locations, but the actual output does not. This suggests that the logic for adding empty lines in `_maybe_empty_lines` is not functioning as intended.

The cause of this bug could be a miscalculation or inconsistency in the computation of the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line.

One of the possible approaches for fixing this bug is to thoroughly review the logic for adding empty lines in different scenarios within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Carefully check the conditions, comparisons, and assignments to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being calculated and added in each case.

After analyzing the logic and making the necessary corrections, here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    newlines_before = 0
    newlines_after = 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            newlines_before = max(1, newlines_before)
        else:
            newlines_before = max(0, newlines_before-1)
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return newlines_before, newlines_after

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return newlines_before, newlines_after
        
        if depth:
            newlines_before = max(0, newlines_before-1)
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines_before = max(before, 1)
        return newlines_before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines_before = max(before or 1, newlines_before)
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines_before = max(before or 1, newlines_before)
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    return newlines_before, newlines_after
```

Please use this corrected version of the function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version. This should address the issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` passes without triggering the assertion error.
