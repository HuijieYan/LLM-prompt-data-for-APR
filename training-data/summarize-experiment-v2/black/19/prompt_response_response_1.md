Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely due to incorrect logic and handling of various conditions related to the current and previous lines. The function aims to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the processed line based on different conditions, but it seems to have discrepancies in the calculations.

To fix the bug, it's essential to thoroughly review the logic and conditions within the function and ensure that the calculations align with the expected behavior for different types of lines and relationships with the previous line. Additionally, it may be necessary to update and add unit tests to verify the correct functioning of the function.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed based on the identified issues and expected input/output variable information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The suggested corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function aims to address the identified issues and align the logic with the expected behavior for different scenarios. The corrections are based on the clarification of the intended functionality and the identified discrepancies in the original code.

This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
