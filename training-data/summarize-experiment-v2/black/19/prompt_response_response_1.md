Based on the information provided, the potential error location within the _maybe_empty_lines function seems to be the logic for adjusting the variables max_allowed, first_leaf, before, depth, is_decorator, and self.previous_defs. These variables are used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

The failing test is asserting the format equality between the expected and actual output, and the error message indicates a mismatch in the number of empty lines in the output. This suggests that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is not functioning as expected.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of certain conditions or incorrect calculations of the variables that determine the number of empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the logic for determining the number of empty lines and ensuring that it correctly accounts for different conditions such as decorators, imports, flow control, etc.
2. Check the logic for adjusting the variables max_allowed, before, and depth in different scenarios to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned.

Here's the corrected code for the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected code should now handle various scenarios and conditions to correctly determine the number of empty lines. This should address the issue identified in the failing test and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
