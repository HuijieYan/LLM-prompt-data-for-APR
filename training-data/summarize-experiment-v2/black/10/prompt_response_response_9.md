The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles the indentation and processing of new line characters in the 'prefix' string. There are discrepancies in the handling of white spaces, tabs, and new line characters, which leads to incorrect output in certain cases, as observed in the failing test.

The buggy function '_partially_consume_prefix' in the buggy class 'Driver' has a logic issue, particularly in the handling of spacing, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the spacing, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, ensuring that the indentation is updated accurately and consistently. Additionally, the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable needs to be reviewed and adjusted.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
          
        return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

This corrected version of the function should fix the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function now accurately processes the 'prefix' string, handles indentation, and updates the variables based on the input, ensuring the correct output in the failing test cases.
