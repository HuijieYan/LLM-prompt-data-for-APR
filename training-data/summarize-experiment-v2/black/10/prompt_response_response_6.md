The problem occurs when the function encounters a comment that is indented differently than the code. The function incorrectly handles the indentation, causing the failing test. This is caused by the way the function tracks indentation and waits for a newline character.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for tracking the indentation and waiting for a newline character. We also need to ensure that the comment maintains the same indentation as the code.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # handle comments indentation
                if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
