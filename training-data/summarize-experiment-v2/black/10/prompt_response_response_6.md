Potential error location: The bug might be in the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters.

Bug's cause: The function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters when processing a prefix string. This leads to incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling indentation and newline characters to correctly identify and maintain the correct indentation level for comments.
2. Implement a better mechanism for tracking the current column and handling the wait for a newline character.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass with the expected input/output variable values.
