Given the information provided, it seems that the potential error location within the problematic function is related to the processing and manipulation of white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, leading to incorrect updates of the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables.
(b). The failing test in the buggy class 'test_black.py' highlights the discrepancy in the indentation of comments after a dedent.
(c). The corresponding error message "AssertionError: 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass' != 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'" further emphasizes the incorrect indentation after a dedent in the failing test.
(d). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable values include incorrect indentation and handling of white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string.
(e). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable values show the expected behavior of the function when processing comments and indentation.
(f). The GitHub issue describes how the incorrect indentation for tabulated comments occurs after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Correctly handling white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string to ensure proper update of the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables.
2. Revising the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable to accurately determine when to wait for a new line character.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function ensures proper handling of white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the accurate update of the 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables. It should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
