Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py
    
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:  # char is either a newline or an indent
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    if char == '\n':
                        current_column = 0
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report. It addresses the potential issues with the logic and handling of the `wait_for_nl` variable, ensuring that it is reset and updated correctly based on the input prefix string.
