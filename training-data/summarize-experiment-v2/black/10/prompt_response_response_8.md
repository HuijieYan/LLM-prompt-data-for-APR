Based on the detailed analysis, it appears that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of indentation for comments when the code is dedented. The issue is related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` identifies and handles the indentation of comments. The function fails to correctly preserve the indentation of comments when code is dedented, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to properly handle the indentation of comments when the code is dedented.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    # adjust the line to the correct indentation
                    current_line = ' ' * (column - current_column) + current_line.lstrip()
                    current_column = column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments when the code is dedented, and the failing test should pass.
