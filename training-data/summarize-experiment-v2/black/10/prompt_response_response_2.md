Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the function is the block that determines the behavior when encountering tabs, spaces, and new line characters. The logic for updating the 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables based on these characters seems to be incorrect, leading to the discrepancy in the test cases and the GitHub issue.

Bug's cause:
(a). The current logic for handling tabs, spaces, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect updates of the 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables.
(b). The failing test cases and the GitHub issue both indicate that the function fails to correctly handle indentation and comments, resulting in incorrect output.
(c). The failing test points to the discrepancy in the output for the provided input, indicating a problem with how the function processes the 'prefix' string.
(d). The GitHub issue also highlights the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, which aligns with the observed discrepancy in the failing test cases.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for updating 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables based on encountering tabs, spaces, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and comments within the 'prefix' string, aligning with the expected behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code revises the logic for updating the 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables based on encountering tabs, spaces, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. It also ensures that the function correctly handles the indentation and comments within the 'prefix' string.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also aims to resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
