class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified the comparison to include equal to sign
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl here to handle unexpected empty lines
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the comparison `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to `if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column` and resetting `wait_for_nl` appropriately, the corrected function should now handle the prefix string and column value correctly, leading to the expected output in the failing test cases and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Please note that the provided correction assumes that the issue described in the GitHub bug report is accurately represented and that the correction accurately addresses the problem. Additional testing and review may be necessary to ensure that the corrected function works as intended in all relevant cases.
