The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles the processing of white spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. It also seems that the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable is not functioning correctly.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function improperly handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, leading to incorrect updates of the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables. This results in incorrect indentation and processing of comment lines in the prefix.

To fix the bug, possible approaches include revisiting the logic for handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, ensuring that the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables are updated correctly. Additionally, the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable needs to be reviewed and adjusted to properly handle the presence of new line characters.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the logic for updating the 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' variables. This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
