The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. This condition is used to check if the current comment line needs to be indented further. However, the logic within this condition is not correctly handling the indentation, leading to the incorrect behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the indentation level for comment lines after a dedent. This results in the incorrect indentation level for tabulated comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation level for comment lines and adjust them accordingly. The logic within the conditional statement mentioned above needs to be updated to ensure correct handling of the comment indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Adjusted to reflect tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

I made one small adjustment in the code: when encountering a tab character, the `current_column` now increases by 8 (the typical width of a tab). This change ensures that the function correctly handles tab characters and adjusts the indentation level accordingly.

By using the corrected function above, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, this correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
