Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. The intent is to check if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the given column value. However, when there is a dedent followed by a comment, the condition doesn't behave as expected.

Bug's cause:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming characters from a given `prefix` until a specific column is reached.
- When there is a dedent followed by a comment, the function is not handling the indentation correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

Proposed approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition `current_column < column` to `current_column <= column` to include the case where the current column is equal to the given column value.
2. Check for cases where a comment follows a dedent and ensure that the correct indentation is maintained.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the proposed changes, the corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub by maintaining the correct indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
