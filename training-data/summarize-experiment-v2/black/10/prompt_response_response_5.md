Analysis:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `Driver` class. It appears to be related to the formatting of code, specifically in handling the indentation of comments after dedent operations. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates that the function is incorrectly manipulating the indentation of comments. The failing test presents the actual and expected output, along with an error message, clearly pointing to the discrepancy.

The discrepancy arises due to the incorrect comparison between two sets of string representations. This indicates that the function is not producing the expected output due to an issue with indentation when processing comments.

The GitHub issue further highlights the problem as it clarifies that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the logic related to handling white spaces, new line characters, and comments. The function needs to correctly update the variables such as 'current_line', 'current_column', and 'wait_for_nl' based on the input prefix and column values.

The bug's cause is attributed to the function's failure to properly handle the given input parameters, leading to incorrect manipulation of indentation for comments after dedenting operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include revising the logic for handling white spaces, new line characters, and comments in the function. Additionally, the function may need to be updated to correctly process and update the variables related to line content, indentation, and comment presence.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, ''.join([current_line, prefix[len(res):]])
```

The revised function includes updates to correctly handle white spaces, new line characters, and comments in the prefix string. It also ensures the proper update of the variables related to line content, indentation, and comment presence. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
