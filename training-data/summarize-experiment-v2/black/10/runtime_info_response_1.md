Based on the given information, it seems that the buggy function is designed to process and manipulate lines of code. The function takes a 'prefix' string and a 'column' integer as input, and based on the runtime values and types of the variables inside the function, it seems to be appending the lines to a list and updating other variables based on the input.

In analyzing the failing test cases, it looks like the bug might involve the handling of white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. As seen in Cases 1, 3, and 6, the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables are being updated to incorrect values, which could lead to incorrect output.

The discrepancy in Case 5 also indicates that the function is not properly handling the prefix string when updating the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables. 

In Case 2 and Case 4, the 'wait_for_nl' variable is not being updated correctly, which indicates a potential issue with the logic that determines when to wait for a new line character.

In summary, the failing test cases suggest that the bug in the function could be related to how it handles white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable. Further investigation into these aspects of the function's core logic is necessary to fix the bug.
