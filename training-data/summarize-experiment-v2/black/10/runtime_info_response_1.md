The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume the prefix string based on a given column. The function iterates through the prefix string character by character, building lines and updating the current column count. Once it reaches the specified column or encounters a newline character, it returns the consumed portion and the remaining prefix.

After analyzing the provided test cases, it seems that there might be issues with the logic of the `wait_for_nl` condition. In some cases, it may not be reset correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Based on the test cases, it appears that the cases where `wait_for_nl` is not reset appropriately (either staying `True` when it shouldn't or being set to `False` when it should remain `True`) are leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, you may need to review the conditions and logic surrounding the `wait_for_nl` variable and ensure that it is properly reset and updated as the function iterates through the prefix string. Additionally, consider the behavior for different types of whitespace characters (e.g., spaces and tabs) and newlines, making sure they are handled correctly according to the intended logic.
