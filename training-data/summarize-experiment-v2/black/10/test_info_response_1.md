The failing test is due to the incorrect comparison between two sets of string representations. The difference between the strings is that the comment line appears incorrectly indented in the first string. The failing test is located in 'tests/test_black.py' in line 517 of the code.

This would simplify to:
```
AssertionError: 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass' != 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'
```
