The error message suggests that the failing assertion is due to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs of the `assertFormatEqual` function. Specifically, it shows a visual comparison of the two strings and indicates that the assertion failed. However, it does not directly point to the root cause of the failure in the code.

Given the error message, it is likely that the issue is within the implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file which is placing incorrect indentation for the comment line "# comment" in the `contents_tab` string.

Simplified Error: 
```
AssertionError: 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass\n' != 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'
```
