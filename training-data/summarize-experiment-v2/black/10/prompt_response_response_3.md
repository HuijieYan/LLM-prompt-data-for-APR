                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters, as well as the logic for updating the `wait_for_nl` variable.

The bug's cause is that the function is failing to properly handle the given input parameters, specifically related to line content, indentation, and comment presence. This leads to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are updated correctly based on the input prefix.
2. Properly handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters within the `prefix` string.
3. Checking and updating the `current_line` variable based on different characters encountered in the prefix.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function. The adjusted logic should resolve the incorrect indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent:
The corrected function is as follows:

1. Added `current_line += char` after updating `current_column` for space and tab characters to correctly track the current line content.
2. Updated the logic for handling new line characters to reset `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly.
3. Adjusted the logic for updating `wait_for_nl` to ensure it behaves as expected based on the input prefix.

The corrected function should address the bug and produce the expected indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
