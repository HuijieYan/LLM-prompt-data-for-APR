The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class. It is related to the failing test `test_comment_indentation` from the `tests/test_black.py` file. The error message indicates that the indentation is being incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the indentation level and waiting for a new line, resulting in incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line. This can be achieved by keeping track of the correct indentation level and only waiting for a new line when necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = True
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and the expected input/output variable information. This correction also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub report.
