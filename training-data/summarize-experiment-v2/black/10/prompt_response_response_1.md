The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic for handling white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable. Additionally, the handling of comments and indentation within the 'prefix' string could be a contributing factor to the bug.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is designed to process and manipulate lines of code. It takes a 'prefix' string and a 'column' integer as input, and based on the runtime values and types of the variables inside the function, it seems to be appending the lines to a list and updating other variables based on the input.

(b). The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing due to the incorrect comparison between two sets of string representations. The difference between the strings is that the comment line appears incorrectly indented in the first string. This discrepancy occurs due to the faulty behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

(c). The actual input/output variable value discrepancies are observed when the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables are being updated to incorrect values in the failing test cases.

(d). The corresponding error message is an `AssertionError` indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual string representations.

(e). The actual input/output variable value discrepancy lies in the faulty behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle the white spaces, new line characters, comments, and indentation within the 'prefix' string.

(f). The expected input/output variable value discrepancies are related to the incorrect handling and updating of the variables `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `char` based on the input `prefix` and `column` values.

(g). The GitHub issue reports a similar faulty behavior related to tabulated comments after a dedent, indicating a discrepancy in indentation handling when using tabs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling white spaces, new line characters, comments, and indentation within the 'prefix' string to ensure correct behavior.
2. Update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly process and update the variables related to line content, indentation, and comment presence based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The above corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
