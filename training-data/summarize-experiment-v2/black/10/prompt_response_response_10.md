Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. It is also likely that the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable is causing issues.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function appears to have issues with handling white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, leading to incorrect updates of the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables.
(b). The failing test in the 'test_comment_indentation' function of the failing test file 'tests/test_black.py', specifically tests the indentation of comments after a dedent, and the output comparison reveals the discrepancy in the indentation.
(c). The failing test's AssertionError confirms that the issue is related to the incorrect comparison between two sets of string representations with incorrect comment indentation.
(d). The GitHub issue further confirms that the incorrect indentation occurs specifically when the input file uses tabs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement a more robust logic for handling white spaces, new line characters, and comments within the 'prefix' string.
2. Review and update the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable to ensure correct handling of new line characters.
3. Consider revisiting the handling of tabs and spaces within the prefix string to address the specific issue raised in the GitHub report.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Update condition to include equal to column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Change the tab increment to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column when encountering new line
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl when encountering new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The updated code includes adjustments to the conditions for comparing the column and updates the tab increment to 4 spaces. This corrected code aims to address the issues related to incorrect indentation and line handling within the 'prefix' string.

This corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation.
