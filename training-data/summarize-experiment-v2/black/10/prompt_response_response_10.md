Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent. This might be caused by the logic related to 'wait_for_nl' in the _partially_consume_prefix function.

Bug's Cause:
The _partially_consume_prefix function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test to detect a discrepancy in the indentation of comments. The issue is related to the logic that determines when to wait for a newline character and how the current column is updated.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling the 'wait_for_nl' condition to correctly track the indentation level after a dedent.
2. Ensure that the current column is updated accurately for each character, including tabs, spaces, and newline characters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should resolve the indentation issue and ensure that comments are correctly handled after a dedent. The updated logic should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue as described in the GitHub report.
