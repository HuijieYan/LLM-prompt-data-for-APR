        self.assertFormatEqual(fs(contents_spc), contents_spc)
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test is due to the incorrect comparison between two sets of string representations. The difference between the strings is that the comment line appears incorrectly indented in the first string. The failing test is located in 'tests/test_black.py' in line 517 of the code.

This would simplify to:
```
AssertionError: 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass' != 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the given information, it seems that the buggy function is designed to process and manipulate lines of code. The function takes a 'prefix' string and a 'column' integer as input, and based on the runtime values and types of the variables inside the function, it seems to be appending the lines to a list and updating other variables based on the input.

In analyzing the failing test cases, it looks like the bug might involve the handling of white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string. As seen in Cases 1, 3, and 6, the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables are being updated to incorrect values, which could lead to incorrect output.

The discrepancy in Case 5 also indicates that the function is not properly handling the prefix string when updating the 'current_line' and 'current_column' variables. 

In Case 2 and Case 4, the 'wait_for_nl' variable is not being updated correctly, which indicates a potential issue with the logic that determines when to wait for a new line character.

In summary, the failing test cases suggest that the bug in the function could be related to how it handles white spaces and new line characters within the 'prefix' string, as well as the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' variable. Further investigation into these aspects of the function's core logic is necessary to fix the bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Upon comparing the expected input/output values with the core logic of the function, it is observed that the function is failing to properly handle the given input parameters. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the variables `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `char` based on the input `prefix` and `column` values.

The discrepancies are particularly noticeable in the cases where the `prefix` contains comments and indentation. The function appears to be failing to correctly handle these cases and update the variables accordingly.

In summary, the discrepancy is likely due to the function's failure to properly process and update the variables related to line content, indentation, and comment presence based on the input parameters.


# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
