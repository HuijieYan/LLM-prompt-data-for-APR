Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error message suggests that the failing assertion is due to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs of the `assertFormatEqual` function. Specifically, it shows a visual comparison of the two strings and indicates that the assertion failed. However, it does not directly point to the root cause of the failure in the code.

Given the error message, it is likely that the issue is within the implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file which is placing incorrect indentation for the comment line "# comment" in the `contents_tab` string.

Simplified Error: 
```
AssertionError: 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n        # comment\n    pass\n' != 'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume the prefix string based on a given column. The function iterates through the prefix string character by character, building lines and updating the current column count. Once it reaches the specified column or encounters a newline character, it returns the consumed portion and the remaining prefix.

After analyzing the provided test cases, it seems that there might be issues with the logic of the `wait_for_nl` condition. In some cases, it may not be reset correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Based on the test cases, it appears that the cases where `wait_for_nl` is not reset appropriately (either staying `True` when it shouldn't or being set to `False` when it should remain `True`) are leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, you may need to review the conditions and logic surrounding the `wait_for_nl` variable and ensure that it is properly reset and updated as the function iterates through the prefix string. Additionally, consider the behavior for different types of whitespace characters (e.g., spaces and tabs) and newlines, making sure they are handled correctly according to the intended logic.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function is expected to partially consume the prefix string based on the given column value. However, based on the expected values, it seems that the function is not working as expected and needs to be fixed. The variables lines, current_line, current_column, wait_for_nl, char, and res, are all expected to have different values at different stages of the function execution. The function needs to be corrected to ensure that it properly handles the prefix string and column value to produce the expected output at each stage.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after dedent

Description:
When working with codebases that use tabs, Black reformats indentation for comments beyond depth 0 incorrectly after a dedent. This issue only occurs when the input file uses tabs.

Environment:
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
- Python version: 3.6.3
- Black version: master
