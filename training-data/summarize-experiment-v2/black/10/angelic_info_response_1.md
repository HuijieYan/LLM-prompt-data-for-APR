The function is expected to partially consume the prefix string based on the given column value. However, based on the expected values, it seems that the function is not working as expected and needs to be fixed. The variables lines, current_line, current_column, wait_for_nl, char, and res, are all expected to have different values at different stages of the function execution. The function needs to be corrected to ensure that it properly handles the prefix string and column value to produce the expected output at each stage.
