After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, as well as the provided GitHub issue, we have identified the potential error location within the problematic function. The issue seems to be related to how FastAPI handles repeated keys in form data.

The problematic function seems to be incorrectly handling the case when the same key is used multiple times in form data. In the failing tests, we observe that the function is not properly converting the form data into lists, sets, or tuples as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and convert them into the appropriate data structures for validation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                for i in range(len(value)):
                    if (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value[i], UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value[i] = await value[i].read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This code should fix the bug and handle repeated keys in form data properly. It should now satisfy the failing test cases and the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository regarding support for repeated keys in form data.
