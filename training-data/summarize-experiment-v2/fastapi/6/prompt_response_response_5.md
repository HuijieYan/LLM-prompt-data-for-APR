Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation does not handle repeated keys correctly, leading to validation errors and incorrect output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it processes the input data to convert it into the expected type. Specifically, the handling of repeated keys in the form data is causing discrepancies in the output values.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in the form data and convert them into the appropriate data structure that matches the expected type of the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug and also aligns with the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function is updated to handle repeated keys in the form data by using `getlist()` method for FormData and adjusting the validation logic accordingly.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output variable information and also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to handling repeated keys in form data.
