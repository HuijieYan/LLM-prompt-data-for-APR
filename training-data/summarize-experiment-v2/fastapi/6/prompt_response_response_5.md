The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely caused by the handling of different field shapes, such as lists, sets, and tuples, and not properly considering the type of received_body. This results in incorrect extraction and validation of values, leading to the failing tests and the corresponding error messages.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the different field shapes appropriately, consider the type of received_body, and validate the values against the required parameters. Additionally, the function should handle file uploads and empty values correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            # Handle file uploads
            if (
                isinstance(field.field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field.field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            # Validate the value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function includes proper handling of different field shapes, consideration of received_body type, and correct validation of values against the required parameters. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests and align with the expected input/output variable information.

Additionally, the corrected function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to supporting repeated key=value in form data, as it now correctly processes the received body and handles repeated keys as lists before validation.
