The issue in the `request_body_to_args` function is due to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The function only captures the last value for a repeated key, leading to incorrect validation. This aligns with the GitHub issue raised, indicating a mismatch between the expected behavior and the current implementation.

To fix this issue, the function needs to capture all values for repeated keys and assign them as a list to the same key before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        form_data = received_body.multi_items()
        data_mapping = {}
        
        for key, value in form_data:
            if key not in data_mapping:
                data_mapping[key] = [value]
            else:
                data_mapping[key].append(value)
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = data_mapping.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

This corrected function captures all values for repeated keys in the form data and assigns them as a list to the same key before validation. It addresses the underlying issue and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub discussion thread.
