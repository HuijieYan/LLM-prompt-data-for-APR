The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has several issues, including incorrect handling of different field shapes, inconsistencies in the received body, and incorrect validation and processing of values. This leads to failing tests and assertion errors when the function is used. To fix these issues, the function should be modified to properly handle the different field shapes, validate the values against the parameters, and correctly process the received body.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that determines the value of the field based on its shape and received body type.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of different field shapes, inconsistent processing of the received body, and improper validation and processing of values. This results in failing tests and assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the different field shapes, validate the values against the parameters, and correctly process the received body. Additionally, it should handle various types of field shapes and ensure the proper construction of the `values` dictionary and reporting of errors in the `errors` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
                elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    else:
                        value = await value.read() if isinstance(value, UploadFile) else None

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function properly handles the different field shapes, processes the received body, and validates the values against the parameters. It addresses the issues with the original function and should pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub Bug.
