Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug is related to the way repeated keys in form data are handled in the `request_body_to_args` function. The failing tests and the corresponding error messages indicate that the function is not handling repeated keys properly, leading to unexpected behavior and assertion errors.

The GitHub issue title "Support repeated key=value in form data" describes the problem accurately. The detailed description in the GitHub issue further explains that when repeated keys are present in form data, only the last key=value pair is being handled, which is causing issues with validation.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys properly and validate all the values associated with those keys, not just the last one.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to check for repeated keys and collect all the associated values into a list for validation. This would involve iterating through the form data and collecting all values for each key before performing validation.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.alias] = []
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.alias].append(received_body[field.alias])                
            if not values[field.alias]:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            for value in values[field.alias]:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated keys in form data and validate all associated values. This should address the problem described in the failing tests and the GitHub issue, allowing the function to pass the failing tests and fulfill the expected input/output requirements.

This correction ensures that the function handles repeated keys in form data properly and validates all associated values, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report and enabling the function to pass the failing tests.
