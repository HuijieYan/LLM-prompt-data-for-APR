Based on the analysis provided, the potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different field shapes (e.g., list, set, and tuple) and the inconsistency in processing the received body.

The bug's cause is primarily due to the function not properly handling the different shapes of fields and not considering the type of received_body. This leads to incorrect extraction of values and validation errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Properly handling the different field shapes and extracting values accordingly.
2. Ensuring that the type of received_body is appropriately considered and processed.
3. Validating the values against the required parameters and handling file uploads and empty values as needed.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                    ):
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function properly handles the different field shapes, considers the type of received_body, and validates the values against the required parameters.

The corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to supporting repeated key=value in form data.
