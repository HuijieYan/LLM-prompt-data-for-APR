Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to the way FastAPI handles repeated keys in form data. The current implementation of `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated keys correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior and error responses.

The root cause of the issue is that the function is not correctly processing repeated keys when received in form data. This results in the incorrect handling of Python lists, sets, and tuples, ultimately leading to the 422 status code in the client response.

To fix the problem, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data, ensuring that they are correctly processed as lists, sets, or tuples based on the expected data types.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                raw_value = value
                if field.shape == 1:
                    value = [raw_value] if isinstance(raw_value, str) else raw_value
                elif field.shape == 2:
                    value = set(raw_value) if isinstance(raw_value, list) else raw_value
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function with the corrected code, it should now be able to handle repeated keys in form data accurately and correctly process Python lists, sets, and tuples based on the expected data types.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report by properly collecting repeated keys and assigning their values as lists, sets, or tuples before validation.
