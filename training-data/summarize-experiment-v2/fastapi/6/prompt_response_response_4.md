The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to properly handle different types of input parameters such as list, set, and tuple. This is leading to incorrect conversion of input data and subsequent discrepancies in the output values, causing the failing tests.

The potential error location within the function is in the section where the input value is being processed and converted to match the expected type. This should be the main focus for fixing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of input data into the expected type, and this is leading to discrepancies in the output values for different types of input parameters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion of different input data types (e.g., list, set, tuple) and ensure that the output values match the expected type. Additionally, the function should address the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data and properly validating them as a list before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args`:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    value = list(value)
                else:
                    value = [value]
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                contents = []
                for sub_value in value:
                    if isinstance(sub_value, UploadFile):
                        contents.append(await sub_value.read())
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should properly handle the conversion of different input types and ensure that the output values match the expected type. It should also address the issue mentioned in the GitHub post related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
