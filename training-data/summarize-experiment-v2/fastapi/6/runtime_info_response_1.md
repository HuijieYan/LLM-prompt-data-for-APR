The function request_body_to_args is responsible for extracting values from the received body, validating them against the required parameters, and returning a dictionary of valid values and a list of errors.

From the provided cases, we can observe that the function is not handling the different shapes of fields (e.g., list, set, and tuple) correctly, and is not consistent with the received body. Additionally, the function is not properly considering the type of received_body, leading to incorrect handling of the field values.

To fix these issues, the function needs to handle the different field shapes appropriately and account for the type of received_body. Additionally, the function should validate the values against the parameters and handle file uploads and empty values as needed. With these changes, the function should properly extract values, validate them, and return the correct values and error lists.
