The discrepancies in the test cases are due to the incorrect handling of input parameters with different types within the given function. The function is expecting the input parameters to have a certain type (e.g., list, set, tuple) and is attempting to convert the input data to match this expected type. However, the data conversion process is not functioning properly, leading to incorrect output values.

The key issue seems to be related to the conversion of the input data into the expected type. Specifically, the incorrect assignment of input values to the `value` variable inside the function is leading to discrepancies in the output. This discrepancy arises from the incorrect handling of different data types (e.g., list, set, tuple) within the function's conversion logic, which results in incorrect output values for each test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the different input data types (e.g., list, set, tuple) and convert them into the appropriate data structure that matches the expected type of the input parameters. This will ensure that the function returns the correct values for each test case, regardless of the input parameter type.
