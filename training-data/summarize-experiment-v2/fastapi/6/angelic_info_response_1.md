Summary:
The function is failing because it is not properly handling the scenario where the received data for the 'items' field does not match the specified type (list, set, tuple) defined in the required_params. This is leading to the instantiation of ErrorWrapper instances with incorrect exception types. The function needs to be modified to properly detect and handle these type errors.
