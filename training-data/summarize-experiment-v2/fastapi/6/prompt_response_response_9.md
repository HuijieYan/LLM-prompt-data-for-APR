The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles values from the received_body. Specifically, it seems that the function is not correctly handling multiple values for the same key in the FormData.

The failing tests are expecting the values for 'items' to be a list, set, or tuple, but the current behavior only captures the last value for the 'items' key. This discrepancy in behavior is likely causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of FastAPI when dealing with repeated keys in form data. The user is experiencing similar issues with FastAPI not handling repeated keys as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in the FormData and store the values as lists for the same key. This modification will align with the expected behavior of FastAPI and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if not value:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle repeated keys in the FormData and store the values as lists in the 'values' dictionary. This updated behavior aligns with the expected behavior for handling repeated keys in form data.

The corrected code should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion about the handling of repeated keys in form data.
