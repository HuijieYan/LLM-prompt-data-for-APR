The failing tests have caused the error "assertion error" to raise. The tests expected a response status code of 200, however, receives the response status code: 422. This error message comes from the test file `test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences.py` at lines 29, 37, and 45, respectively. The error indicates that the `response.status_code` is 422 and the expected code is 200. Therefore, the simplification of these messages is "assertion error: expected 200 but received 422", which indicates that the error occurred on the line where the assertion was made.
