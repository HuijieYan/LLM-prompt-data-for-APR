The error messages extracted from the failing tests indicate an assertion exception. You tried to send a request to a server and expected the response status code to be 200. However, the assertion checks failed because the actual response status code was 422.

The failing tests in the files `test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences.py` are closely related to the fault location since they trigger the execution of the `request_body_to_args` function from `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`.

The simplified error message is as follows:
```
E       assert 422 == 200
E         +422
E         -200
...
```
This message illustrates a simple assertion error that the expected response status code of 200 does not match the actual response status code of 422.
