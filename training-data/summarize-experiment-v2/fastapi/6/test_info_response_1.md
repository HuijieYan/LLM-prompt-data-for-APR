From the error messages, it can be deduced that each failing test experiences an assertion error. Specifically, each of the failing tests are expecting a "response.status_code" of 200 from the client post but are instead receiving 422 as the response status code according to the error messages in the command line, denoted by "E assert 422 == 200". This means that the actual status code returned by the call is 422, while the assertion is expecting 200.

To simplify the original error message, the failing tests are encountering assertion errors that are comparing the actual response status code of 422 with the expected response status code of 200.

In summary, the tests are failing due to the unexpected status code returned by the client post responses, and not due to a fault in the test code, since the error is regarding a discrepancy in the response status codes.
