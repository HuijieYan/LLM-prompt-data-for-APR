The issue in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the incorrect processing of repeated keys in form data. The code currently is unable to handle this, resulting in failures when dealing with Python lists, sets, and tuples as form data.

To resolve this issue, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data. This involves collecting the repeated keys and assigning their values to a list before validation occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this fix, the function is now able to properly handle repeated keys in form data and generate the expected output. This corrected function should resolve the issues highlighted in the failing test cases and also address the concerns mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Now, the corrected function can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version and should pass the failing tests while also aligning with the expected input/output variable information and addressing the GitHub issue.
