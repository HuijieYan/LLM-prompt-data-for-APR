Potential Error Location within the Problematic Function:
The potential error in the function lies in the section where it checks the input data type and attempts to convert it for validation. Specifically, the function is not properly handling the scenario where the received data for the 'items' field does not match the specified type (list, set, tuple) defined in the required_params. This leads to the instantiation of ErrorWrapper instances with incorrect exception types.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, is not properly handling input parameters with different types, leading to discrepancies in the output values.
(b). The failing tests in the files `test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences.py` are closely related to the fault location since they trigger the execution of the `request_body_to_args` function from `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`.
(c). The error messages from the failing tests indicate an assertion exception because the expected response status code of 200 does not match the actual response status code of 422, indicating discrepancies in the function's output values.
(d). The discrepancies in the input/output variable values are due to the incorrect handling of input parameters with different types within the function.
(e). The expected input/output variable values are not being met because of the incorrect handling of different data types (e.g., list, set, tuple) within the function's conversion logic.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the different input data types (e.g., list, set, tuple) and convert them into the appropriate data structure that matches the expected type of the input parameters. This will ensure that the function returns the correct values for each test case, regardless of the input parameter type.

The GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" is related to the problem, as it highlights a similar issue where the last key=value wins and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            # Add handling for converting input types to the expected type
            if isinstance(value, list) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list):
                value = value
            elif isinstance(value, set) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
                value = value
            elif isinstance(value, tuple) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, tuple):
                value = value
            else:
                # Handle other cases where the input type does not match the expected type
                value = field.validate(value, {}, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(value, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(value)
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                errors.extend(value)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = value
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code includes additional handling for converting input types to the expected type, as well as proper validation and error handling. This updated function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post by properly handling repeated keys and assigning values as a list before validation.
