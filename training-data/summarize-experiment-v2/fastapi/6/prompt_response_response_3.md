The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling different field shapes and the validation of received values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling different field shapes (e.g., list, set, tuple) and is not consistently validating the received values against the required parameters. This results in incorrect extraction of values and errors, leading to the failing tests and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the different field shapes appropriately, validate the received values against the required parameters, and ensure consistent handling of the received body. Additionally, the function should handle file uploads and empty values as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function processes the received body and extracts values based on the required parameters. It properly handles different field shapes and validation of the values, and constructs the `values` dictionary and `errors` list. This version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Additionally, the corrected version should address the issue posted in the GitHub Bug Title: "Support repeated key=value in form data" by appropriately collecting repeated keys and assigning their values as a list before validation.
