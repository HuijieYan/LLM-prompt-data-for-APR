The issue seems to be related to handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. The bug is likely in the `request_body_to_args` function, which is failing to handle repeated keys in form data properly. This causes the tests to fail with unexpected status codes.

The failing tests provide valuable insight into the nature of the bug. In each case, the expected behavior is that the `request_body_to_args` function should process the form data and return the values in a format that aligns with the type of field.

The GitHub issue sheds light on the problem and proposes a potential solution. It suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix this bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data and return the values in the expected format. Specifically, when processing form data with repeated keys, the function should group the values of repeated keys into a list and return it as the value for the corresponding field.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or len(value) == 0:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, (UploadFile, sequence_types))
        ):
            if not isinstance(value, list):
                value = [value]
            awaitables = [v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This code ensures that the function properly collects repeated keys in form data and assigns the values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test cases pass.

Note: This is a proposed fix based on the information provided. It should be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness.
