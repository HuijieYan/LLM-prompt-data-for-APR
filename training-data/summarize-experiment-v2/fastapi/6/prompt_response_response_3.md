Based on the failing test and the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to the function `request_body_to_args` failing to properly handle repeated keys in form data, resulting in a 422 status code response when it should be 200.

Upon reviewing the variable values and types, it's evident that the function is failing to handle repeated keys in the form data correctly, which leads to the invalid status code response. The `request_body_to_args` function should be modified to handle repeated keys correctly and validate against all values. This aligns with the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

The fix for the `request_body_to_args` function involves collecting repeated keys in the form data and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that handles repeated keys in form data:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: fastapi/dependencies/utils.py

# corrected function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:

    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            form_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if form_values:
                if len(form_values) == 1:
                    value = form_values[0]
                else:
                    value = form_values

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By making the above correction to the function, it now correctly handles repeated keys in form data and validates against all values. This should resolve the issue causing the 422 status code response and aligns with the desired solution outlined in the GitHub issue.
