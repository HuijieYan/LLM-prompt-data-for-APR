Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue is related to how FastAPI handles repeated keys in form data, specifically when using the `List` type in the `Form` definition. It seems that only the last key=value pair is being captured, resulting in validation errors when expecting multiple values for the same key.

The potential error within the `request_body_to_args` function is likely related to how it processes the received form data and how it handles repeated keys within the form data. It seems that the function is not properly handling the scenario where the same key appears multiple times in the form data.

The failing test cases all involve sending form data with repeated keys (`items` in this case) and expecting the server to process them as lists, sets, or tuples. However, the current implementation is not handling these scenarios correctly, leading to validation errors and incorrect responses.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data, especially when the corresponding model field is defined as a list, set, or tuple. The function should be modified to correctly process the form data and capture all values associated with the repeated keys.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data by capturing all values associated with the repeated keys and storing them as lists, sets, or tuples based on the model field definition.

2. Update the validation logic to ensure that all captured values are correctly validated against the model field definition, taking into account the presence of repeated keys and their associated values.

3. Update the return values of the function to include the correctly processed values and any validation errors that may occur based on the updated logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
        if value is not None:
            if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list):
                values[field.name] = value
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
                values[field.name] = set(value)
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, tuple):
                values[field.name] = tuple(value)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

This updated function processes the received form data correctly, capturing all values associated with repeated keys and appropriately storing them as lists, sets, or tuples based on the model field definition. It also updates the validation logic to handle these scenarios and returns the correct values and errors.

With these updates, the `request_body_to_args` function should now be able to handle repeated keys in form data and process them correctly, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
