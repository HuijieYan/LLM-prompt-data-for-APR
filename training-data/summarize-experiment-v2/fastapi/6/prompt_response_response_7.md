Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to the incorrect handling of different field shapes (e.g., list, set, tuple) and the type of received_body. Additionally, the function does not properly extract values, validate them, or handle file uploads and empty values.

Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the function is likely related to the handling of different field shapes and the type of received_body, specifically in the section where values are extracted and validated against the required parameters.

Bug's cause:
The function is not properly handling different field shapes, such as lists, sets, and tuples, and is not consistent with the received body. This causes incorrect handling of field values and leads to validation errors. This is also consistent with the GitHub issue describing the behavior of collecting repeated keys and assigning their values as a list before validation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle different field shapes appropriately.
2. Ensure the function properly validates the type of the received value.
3. Correctly construct the `values` dictionary and report any errors in the `errors` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = received_body.get(field.alias) if received_body else None

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field, ModelField) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

            if isinstance(field, ModelField) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape not in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                isinstance(field, ModelField)
                and isinstance(received_body, FormData)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            ):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function handles the different field shapes, properly validates the received value, constructs the `values` dictionary, and reports any errors in the `errors` list. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by correctly collecting repeated keys as lists before validation.
