### Analysis

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for parsing the request body and populating the values and errors accordingly. The failing tests are encountering assertion errors due to unexpected status codes returned by the client post responses.

The expected behavior is for the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and validate each value against the specified required parameters.

The GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in a 2-tuple list from `request.form()` and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This aligns with the observed behavior of the failing tests.

### Bug Cause

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function appears to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data and the validation against the required parameters. The function fails to properly handle repeated keys and only captures the last value, leading to incorrect validation and error reporting.

The function seems to be incorrectly processing the received body, resulting in the unexpected behavior observed in the failing tests.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and collect them into a list before validation.
2. Ensure that the function processes all values for repeated keys and validates them against the required parameters.
3. Update the function to report errors correctly for each value being validated against the required parameters.

### Corrected Code

Based on the analysis, the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        received_data = dict(received_body)
        
        for field in required_params:
            field_values = received_data.get(field.name)
            
            if field_values is not None:
                if not isinstance(field_values, list):
                    field_values = [field_values]
                
                # Validate each value against the required parameter
                for value in field_values:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.name))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code:
- The `received_body` is converted to a dictionary to handle repeated keys.
- For each required parameter, the function collects all values for the parameter, validates them individually, and populates the `values` and `errors` accordingly.

With this corrected code, the `request_body_to_args` function should properly handle repeated keys in form data and validate each value against the required parameters.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
