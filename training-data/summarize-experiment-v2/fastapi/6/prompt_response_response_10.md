Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is likely in the handling of the `received_body` parameter when it has a different type (e.g., list, set, tuple) compared to the expected input type defined in the `required_params`. This is leading to discrepancies in the conversion process and the generation of incorrect output values.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the conversion of input parameters with different types (e.g., list, set, tuple) to match the expected type defined in the `required_params`. This leads to the instantiation of ErrorWrapper instances with incorrect exception types and affects the overall validation and output values of the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion of input data with different types to match the expected type defined in the `required_params`. This will ensure that the function is able to correctly validate and generate the expected output values for each test case.

Additionally, the suggestions provided in the GitHub issue should be considered for improvement. The issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This approach can help address the problem of handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.

Corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
This corrected version of the function properly handles the conversion of input data with different types (e.g., list, set, tuple) to match the expected type defined in the `required_params`. It also addresses the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data as suggested in the GitHub issue.

By using this corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should help resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
