The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect usage of Popen and the incorrect command being executed to retrieve the version of the fish shell.

The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed and the incorrect usage of Popen, leading to the incorrect version being retrieved and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to retrieve the version of the fish shell and properly capture the output using Popen.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and accurately retrieve the version of the fish shell. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub.
