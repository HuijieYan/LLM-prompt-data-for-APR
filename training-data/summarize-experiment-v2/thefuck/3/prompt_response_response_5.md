### Analyzing the bug
The `info` function of the `Fish` class in `shells/fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. On executing the failing test, it is observed that the value of `version` is `'3.5.9'` instead of `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, which causes the assertion error. The expected value of `proc` and `proc.stdout.read` also differ from the actual values during the failing test execution.

The GitHub issue title and description suggest that the bug is causing the Fish shell initialization to hang when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Error location within the function
The potential error location is in the `Popen` call, where the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is being executed to get the version of Fish shell. It seems that the command is not returning the expected version string.

### Bug cause
The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is not returning the expected version string, which is required to construct the `version` variable. This could be due to the incorrect command being executed or the parsing of the output.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug
1. Check if the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is the correct way to get the Fish shell version. It might be necessary to use a different command or approach for obtaining the version string.
2. Ensure that the parsing of the output from the `Popen` call is correctly done to extract the version string.
3. Use a different method or command to reliably fetch the Fish shell version to avoid any issues with different versions or configurations of Fish shell.

### Corrected code for the `info` function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
The corrected code uses `['fish', '--version']` to obtain the version of the Fish shell, and then correctly extracts the version string from the output. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
