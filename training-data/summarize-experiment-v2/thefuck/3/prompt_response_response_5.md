Given the provided input and to fix the bug in the `info` function, we can deduce the following:

The problem is that the `info` function is extracting the version from the output without querying the actual fish version. The function needs to query the actual fish version using the `--version` argument.

The issue is related to the function `info` in the `Fish` class, and the failing test is indicating that the output of the function does not match the expected value.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly retrieving the version of the fish shell. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs, as indicated by the failing test.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the `info` function to use the `--version` argument while querying the fish version.
2. We need to ensure that the function returns the expected output, which is the correct fish shell version in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py
from .generic import Generic
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The fix involves using the `--version` argument while querying the fish version and then extracting the version number from the output. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
