The problematic function appears to be "info(self)". The issue seems to stem from the fact that the Popen call is using ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] instead of ['fish', '--version'], which causes the function to return the incorrect version of the Fish shell.

To fix this issue, the "info(self)" function in the Fish class needs to be updated to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the correct and fixed version of the "info(self)" function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the fixed and corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The fixed code should resolve the issue with obtaining the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test case. It also aligns with the expected input/output variable information.

This corrected code can then be used to replace the buggy version of the function.
