The issue here is that the function `info` in the Fish class is not returning the correct version of the Fish shell. The function is trying to get the version using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is incorrect. The function should get the version using `fish --version` instead.

The cause of the bug can be identified as follows:
(a) The buggy function tries to get the version of the Fish shell using an incorrect command.
(b) The failing test expects the version '3.5.9', but the function returns a different version.
(c) The error message shows the assertion error between the expected and actual version.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly fetch the version of Fish shell using the `fish --version` command.

The corrected code for the `info` function in the Fish class is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

With this correction, the function will return the correct version of the Fish shell, which will satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
