The issue in the function info() is that it is trying to obtain the Fish version by running 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the failing test function is expecting output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' which is not obtained using the current logic. 

The potential error is in the way the function is executing the command to get the Fish version, and how it's extracting the version from the command output.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the command executed to get the version and how we extract it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function ensures that the command 'fish --version' is executed to get the version, and then extracts the version from the command output using the correct indexing. This should fix the failing test and any issues related to obtaining the Fish version.
