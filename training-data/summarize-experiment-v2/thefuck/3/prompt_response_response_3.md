Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the `info` function is the incorrect usage of the `Popen` instance and the incorrect command used to capture the version of the Fish shell.

The bug's cause is that the `Popen` function is incorrectly used to execute the command and capture the output, resulting in incorrect values being returned. Additionally, the command used to capture the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, leading to the erroneous version being retrieved.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` function should be used correctly to execute the command and capture the actual output, rather than using mocked values. Furthermore, the correct command should be used to capture the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# The source code of the corrected function
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1].strip())
```

The corrected function uses the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and correctly captures the output using the `Popen` function. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
