The bug occurs in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is currently trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, in the failing test, the expected version is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, which does not match the current implementation.

The actual input/output variable values show that the `proc` variable is a `MagicMock` object and the `version` extracted from it is `'3.5.9'`. However, the expected input/output variable values show that the `proc` variable should have a value of `'<MagicMock name='Popen()' id='140050497243408'>'` and the `version` should be `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue suggests that the problem might be related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin and how it interacts with TheFuck.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` method to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in a way that matches the expected value from the failing test. We also need to ensure that the method does not trigger a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` method should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
