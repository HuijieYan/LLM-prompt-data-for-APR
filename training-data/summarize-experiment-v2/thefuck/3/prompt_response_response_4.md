The issue seems to be caused by the incorrect command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The test is expecting the version in the format 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the code is only capturing the version number. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we should modify the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. We will also modify the return value to include the string in the expected format.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the oh-my-fish plugin.
