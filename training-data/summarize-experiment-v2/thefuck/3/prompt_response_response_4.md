The issue in the `info` function of the `Fish` class arises from the fact that it's trying to get the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual values, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the call to Popen should be modified to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
