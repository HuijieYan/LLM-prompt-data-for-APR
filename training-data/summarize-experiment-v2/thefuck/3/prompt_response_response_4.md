The issue in the code is that the command to get the fish version is incorrect. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' returns the value of the environment variable FISH_VERSION, not the version of the fish shell itself. This is why the test is failing with the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the command to get the fish version should be 'fish --version'. This command will return the version of the fish shell, which is what the test is expecting.

The corrected code for the 'info' function in the Fish class should be as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
