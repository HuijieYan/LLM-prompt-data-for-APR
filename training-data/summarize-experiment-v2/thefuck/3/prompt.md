Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python

        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the current shell by running a command in the Fish shell and capturing the output. However, the `Popen` function is not being used correctly, and the output is being mocked, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` function should be used correctly to execute the command and capture the actual output, rather than using mocked values. This will ensure that the function retrieves the correct version of the Fish shell and returns the accurate information.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The provided code contains a Popen instance to execute a shell command and retrieve the version of the fish shell. The function seems to be correct, but without any input parameters, it is difficult to accurately predict the expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution. However, based on the provided code, it seems that the expected values are as follows:

- `proc`: A MagicMock instance representing the Popen object.
- `version`: A string representing the version of the fish shell.
- `proc.stdout.read`: A MagicMock instance representing the read method of the stdout attribute of the Popen object.
- `proc.stdout`: A MagicMock instance representing the stdout attribute of the Popen object.

These values and types are expected right before the function's return, and any deviation from these values/types would indicate a bug in the function.


# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.

Reference: oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11

1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, the expected input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class docs
   (c). The failing test
   (d). The corresponding error message
   (e). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value
   (f). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value
   (g). The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
   (b). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
