The issue with the current function is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

To fix this, update the `info` function in the `Fish` class to use the correct command to get the version and ensure that it matches the expected output of the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(", ")[1])
```

This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. It also provides the correct version format for the `info` function. Now the function returns the expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution.

The updated function uses the correct command to get the Fish shell version, and the `info` function should now return the expected value. This should also resolve the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.
