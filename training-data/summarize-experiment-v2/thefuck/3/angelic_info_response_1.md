The provided code contains a Popen instance to execute a shell command and retrieve the version of the fish shell. The function seems to be correct, but without any input parameters, it is difficult to accurately predict the expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution. However, based on the provided code, it seems that the expected values are as follows:

- `proc`: A MagicMock instance representing the Popen object.
- `version`: A string representing the version of the fish shell.
- `proc.stdout.read`: A MagicMock instance representing the read method of the stdout attribute of the Popen object.
- `proc.stdout`: A MagicMock instance representing the stdout attribute of the Popen object.

These values and types are expected right before the function's return, and any deviation from these values/types would indicate a bug in the function.
