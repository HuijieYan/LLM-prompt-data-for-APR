### 1. Analysis
- The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is attempting to get the version of Fish shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output.
- The failing test in `test_fish.py` is testing for the specific output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" when the version is "3.5.9".
- The error message shows that the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9".
- The runtime value and type of variables show that the value of `version` is being set incorrectly due to the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

### 2. Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in the line `echo $FISH_VERSION` within the `Popen` call in fish.py. The command is not providing the desired output format.

### 3. Bug's Cause
- The bug is caused by the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command in the `info` function not providing the correct output format.
- The failing test is checking for a specific format of the output, which the current implementation does not satisfy.

### 4. Possible Approaches
- Modify the Popen command to run `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the correct output format.
- Update the `info` function to process the output of `fish --version` correctly to match the expected output format.

### 5. Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(' ')[2]  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
The corrected code modifies the Popen command to run `fish --version` and processes the output to extract the version information in the correct format. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variables. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub by Oh-My-Fish.
