Based on the analysis and information provided, the potential error location within the `info` function is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. This causes the incorrect version to be returned, resulting in the failing test.

The bug's cause is that the `Popen` function is not being used correctly to execute the command and capture the actual output. Instead, the output is being mocked, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` function should be used correctly to execute the command and capture the actual output, rather than using mocked values. This will ensure that the function retrieves the correct version of the Fish shell and returns the accurate information.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command `['fish', '--version']` and capturing the actual output from the `Popen` function, the corrected function can now accurately retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return the correct information.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
