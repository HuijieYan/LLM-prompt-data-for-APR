The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to fetch the fish version. Instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', it should be using '--version'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function uses the correct command to fetch the fish version and will pass the failing test. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.

With this fix, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved, as the function now correctly fetches the Fish Shell version and avoids any potential recursive loops.
