Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the usage of Popen and capturing the shell version output.

Bug cause: The function incorrectly uses Popen to execute a command and capture the shell version. Additionally, the test is mocking the output, which causes the function to return incorrect information.

Approach for fixing the bug:

1. Use Popen with the correct command to capture the shell version output.
2. Remove the usage of mocked output and ensure that the actual shell version is captured.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, the Popen function is used with the correct command to capture the shell version output, and the mocked output is removed. This should address the issue and ensure that the function returns the correct information.
