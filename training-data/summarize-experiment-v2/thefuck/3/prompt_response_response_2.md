The potential error in the problematic function is likely due to the command used in Popen to get the FISH_VERSION. The failing test indicates that the expected version string is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual version string obtained from the Popen call is `'3.5.9'`. This discrepancy suggests that the command in the Popen call does not retrieve the version in the expected format.

A possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the command passed to Popen to correctly retrieve the version information in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this corrected code, the Popen call now uses `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version information. The correction also splits the obtained version string at the comma and extracts the version number, resulting in the correct output for the function.

This corrected code addresses the discrepancies in the actual and expected input/output variable values and should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report, as the bug was caused by incorrect retrieval of the version information.
