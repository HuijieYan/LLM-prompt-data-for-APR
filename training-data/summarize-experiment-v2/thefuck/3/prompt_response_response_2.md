The bug in the function `info` in the `Fish` class is caused by using the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is incorrect and instead, the command should be `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the following correction needs to be made to the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the issue posted in GitHub should also be resolved.
