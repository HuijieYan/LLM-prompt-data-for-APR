1. The problem lies in the discrepancy between the expected and actual values of the 'version' variable. The test is expecting the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual value is '3.5.9'. This is causing the assertion error.

2. The potential error location is within the info() function of the Fish class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the test is expecting the output of 'fish --version' to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual output is '3.5.9'. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the info() function to return the output of 'fish --version' in the format expected by the test. We can achieve this by modifying the command passed to Popen in the info() function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the info() function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[6:]  # Extract version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function will return the version in the expected format and the failing test should pass. Additionally, this fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
