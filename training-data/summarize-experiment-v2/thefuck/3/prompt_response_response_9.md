The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by incorrect usage of the `Popen` function, as well as incorrect shell command and output parsing. The function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the `Popen` function is not being used correctly, and the output is being mocked, resulting in incorrect values.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` function should be used correctly to execute the command and capture the actual output, and the output parsing should be adjusted to extract the version number accurately.

To resolve the issue, the corrected version of the function should be as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace("fish, version ", "")
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version of the function uses `Popen` to execute the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell (`fish --version`), and then it captures the output using `communicate()` and parses the version from the output accurately.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
