The bug is caused by the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command is incorrect and leads to a wrong version string being returned. This causes the failing test to compare the incorrect version string to the expected one, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be updated to output the correct version string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix updates the command to retrieve the Fish shell version by using `['fish', '--version']`, which should output the correct version string. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
