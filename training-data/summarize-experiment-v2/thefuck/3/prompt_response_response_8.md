The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect usage of Popen to capture the version of the fish shell. Instead of executing the command and capturing the actual output, the function is using mocked values, resulting in incorrect version information.

The bug's cause is due to the misuse of Popen and incorrect retrieval of the shell version.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug include:
1. Executing the command to retrieve the version using Popen and capturing the actual output.
2. Updating the test to mock the correct output of the shell command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Updated failing test function for the corrected code
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.return_value = b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With this fix, the function should now execute the shell command to retrieve the version and return the correct version information. Additionally, the updated test now mocks the correct output of the shell command. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and pass the failing test.
