The issue is with the command being used in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. In the `info` function, the command being run is `fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION` which is different from the expected command `fish --version` as mentioned in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect command being used to fetch the version information of the Fish shell. This results in the incorrect version information being returned, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the version information of the Fish shell should be changed to `fish --version` to align with the expectations of the failing test.

The corrected code for the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code will align with the expected input/output variables during the failing test and will also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
