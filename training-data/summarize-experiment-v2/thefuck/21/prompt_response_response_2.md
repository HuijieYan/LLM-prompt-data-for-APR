The bug is caused by the `IndexError: list index out of range` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. This occurs because the `command.script.split()` is being accessed at index 1 without checking if it exists first. The error message in the failing test indicates that the script is just `git`, which means splitting it by spaces will produce a list with only one element, thus accessing index 1 will result in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be updated to check if the list has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1. Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the code will first check if `len(script_parts) >= 2` before accessing `script_parts[1]`, ensuring that the index is not out of range. This updated code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
