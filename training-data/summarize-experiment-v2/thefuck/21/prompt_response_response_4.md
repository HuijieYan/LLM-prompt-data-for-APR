The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access an index of the split script without first checking if the script even has that many elements. This is causing an IndexError. 

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split script has enough elements before accessing the second index. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) >= 2 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
