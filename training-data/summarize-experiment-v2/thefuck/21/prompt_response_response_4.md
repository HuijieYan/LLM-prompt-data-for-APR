The issue with the current implementation is that the function is splitting the `command.script` by whitespace and then trying to access the second element of the resulting list. However, when the `command.script` is just 'git', there is only one element in the list after the split. This causes the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. If it's not, then the function should return False.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the length of the split_command list is greater than 1. If it is, then it will proceed to check for the 'stash' and 'usage:' conditions. If the length is not greater than 1, it will return False, which is the expected behavior in this case.

This should address the issue and the corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. The corrected function should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
