Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The buggy function is a part of a program that provides corrections for mistyped terminal commands. The function is designed to match a specific command and its output to determine if the command and its parameters are correct.

In this case, the function takes a Command object `command` as input and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`.

The bug in the function is that it directly checks the `command.script.split()[1]` without verifying if `command.script` has multiple words, which leads to a potential error if `command.script` does not contain multiple words. Additionally, the function does not effectively use the `command.stderr` information to determine the match.

To fix this bug, the function should first split the `command.script` and then check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. Furthermore, the function should check both conditions related to `command.stderr` more effectively to determine a match.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The expected behavior of the `match` function is to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the command's stderr contains the phrase "usage:". 

In this case, the input parameters are as follows:
- command.script: 'git'
- command: Command(script='git', stdout='', stderr='\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q')
- command.stderr: '\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'

The expected behavior is to return True, since the script contains "stash" and the stderr contains "usage:". However, the current implementation is checking if the script.split()[1] is equal to "stash", which is not correct. 

The corrected function should check if "stash" is in the command.script and if "usage:" is in command.stderr.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Error when running 'git' commands

Description:
When running 'git' commands with only the word 'git' in the script, it results in an error. The error occurs when running the 'stash' command. This leads to a 'list index out of range' error in the 'git_fix_stash' rule.

Expected Output:
When running 'git' commands, including just the word 'git,' it should not result in an error, specifically when running the 'stash' command.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0
