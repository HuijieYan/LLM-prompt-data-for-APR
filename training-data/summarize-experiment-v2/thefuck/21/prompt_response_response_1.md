The bug is caused by the function trying to split the `command.script` without checking if it has enough elements. This raises an IndexError when there's not enough elements in the split list. The issue is related to providing an incorrect input to the function and a missing or incorrect conditional check within the function.

To fix this issue, we should check if there are enough elements in the split list before attempting to access the second element. Additionally, we should verify that the script starts with 'git' before proceeding with further checks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function checks if the length of the split command is greater than 1, the first part of the script is 'git', the second part is 'stash', and 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

This fix addresses the issue and the function will now correctly determine if the command matches the expected pattern.

This corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.

Now the full corrected function is:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
