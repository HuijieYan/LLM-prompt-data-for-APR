The problem with the `match` function is that it assumes the `command.script` will always have more than one element after splitting by whitespace, and it tries to access the second element without checking. This causes an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `match` function to first check if the length of the splited `command.script` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function will first check if the length of `splited_script` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element, thus avoiding the `IndexError`. This should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
