Approach:
The buggy function is attempting to split the command.script, which represents the command input, and access the second element. However, it does not handle the case where there might not be a second element, leading to an error. We need to update the function to first check the length of the split command, and then access the second element if it exists.

Correction:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function will handle cases where the command input does not contain a second element after splitting, preventing the IndexError. The function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

GitHub Issue Title:
git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git

GitHub Issue Description:
The git_fix_stash rule fails when the command script is just 'git'. This results in a list index out of range error, causing the rule to fail. The corrected version of the function should resolve this issue.

The corrected code addresses the bug by first checking the length of the split command before accessing the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and ensures the rule behaves as expected.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
