The issue is with the `split` function in the `command.script.split()[1]` expression. When the `script` attribute of the `command` object is just 'git', there is only one element in the list returned by `split`, and trying to access the second element results in an IndexError. 

To fix this bug, we can check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. 

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if the length of the split result is greater than 1 and then proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash', resolving the IndexError issue. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
