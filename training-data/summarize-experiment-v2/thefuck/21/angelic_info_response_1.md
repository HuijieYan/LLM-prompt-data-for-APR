The expected behavior of the `match` function is to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the command's stderr contains the phrase "usage:". 

In this case, the input parameters are as follows:
- command.script: 'git'
- command: Command(script='git', stdout='', stderr='\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q')
- command.stderr: '\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'

The expected behavior is to return True, since the script contains "stash" and the stderr contains "usage:". However, the current implementation is checking if the script.split()[1] is equal to "stash", which is not correct. 

The corrected function should check if "stash" is in the command.script and if "usage:" is in command.stderr.
