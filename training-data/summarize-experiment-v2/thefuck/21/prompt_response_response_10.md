The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is caused by the assumption that the `git` command won't be the only command in the `command.script` when it actually is. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script. 

To fix this bug, you should check the length of `command.script.split()` before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) > 1:
        return (script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
