The bug in the provided function is that it directly checks `command.script.split()[1]` without verifying if `command.script` has multiple words, which can lead to an `IndexError` if `command.script` does not contain multiple words. Additionally, the function does not effectively use the `command.stderr` information to determine the match.

To fix this bug, we should first split the `command.script` and then check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. Furthermore, we should check both conditions related to `command.stderr` more effectively to determine a match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()

    if len(script_words) > 1:
        script_contains_stash = 'stash' in script_words[1]
    else:
        script_contains_stash = False

    stderr_contains_usage = 'usage:' in command.stderr

    return script_contains_stash and stderr_contains_usage
```

Now, with this corrected version, the function will split the `command.script`, verify if `stash` is in the split list, and effectively use the `command.stderr` information to determine the match.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
