The problem with the buggy function is that it is trying to split the `command.script` without validating if it contains the minimal required elements for the operation.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By updating the function to first check if the `command.script` starts with 'git stash', we can avoid the 'IndexError' raised due to list index out of range. 

Now, the corrected version of the function would be:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This matches the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.

Now, the TypeError should be resolved, and the new function should pass the failed test as well.
