The issue arises because the buggy function is assuming that the split command will always produce a list containing at least two elements. If the script contains only the command name (`git` in this case), then it will cause the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this, we can check the length of the split command and ensure that it contains at least two elements before accessing the second element to compare with 'stash'. If not, we can return False.

Additionally, the buggy function should also check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. If both conditions are met, then the function should return True.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2 or 'usage:' not in command.stderr:
        return False
    return script_parts[1] == 'stash'
```

This fix will ensure that the function handles the case where the script contains only the command name and prevents the `IndexError` from occurring. Additionally, it checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr before returning True. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
