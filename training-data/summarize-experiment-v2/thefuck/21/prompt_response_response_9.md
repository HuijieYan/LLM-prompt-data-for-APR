The bug seems to be with the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` in the `match` function. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurs, which suggests that `command.script.split()` returns a list with only one element, and hence trying to access the second element via index 1 causes an error.

This bug occurs because the function assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least 2 elements when split using whitespace. To fix this, we need to handle the case where the split doesn't result in at least 2 elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first splits the `command.script` and stores the result in `script_parts`. Then it checks if there are more than 1 elements in the list (to avoid the `IndexError`), and then checks if the second element is `'stash'`. This should handle the case where the script doesn't contain at least 2 elements after splitting.
