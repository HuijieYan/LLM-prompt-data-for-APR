The problem with the buggy function is that it assumes the presence of the second element in the `command.script.split()` list without any checks.

The error message clearly indicates that the function is encountering an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which means that the split list doesn't have a second element. This is because the split list in the failing case only contains the command itself, which is 'git'. The function should take this into account and handle it properly.

To fix this, we need to check if the split list contains more than one element before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this change, we first split the `command.script` and then check if the list contains more than one element before accessing the second element. The function returns `False` if the list does not contain more than one element.

This should resolve the issue and the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

As the result, the corrected function can be dropped in as a replacement for the buggy version. The GitHub issue "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" should also be resolved with this fix.
