The problem with the `match` function is that it assumes that the command script will always have at least two elements after splitting, which is not the case when the command is just 'git'. This leads to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command.

To fix this, we can modify the `match` function to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will first check if the split script has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash', thus avoiding the IndexError.

This fix should address the issue with the failing test and the corresponding error message.

Regarding the GitHub Issue, it can be titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when the command script is just 'git'".

By implementing this fix, the corrected code for the `match` function now satisfies the failing test, the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolves the issue reported in the GitHub.
