Based on the error message and the provided input and output variable information, it seems that the buggy function is failing to handle the case where the command script is just "git" without any additional arguments. The buggy function then tries to split the command script by whitespace and access the second element in the resulting list, causing an IndexError when the list is empty.

To fix this issue, you can modify the buggy function to first check if the command script contains the word "stash" before attempting to split the script and access the second element.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```

This correction will first check if the script contains the word "stash", and only then proceed to split the script and check for the "usage:" keyword in the stderr. This modification will prevent the IndexError when the command script is just "git". With this change, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The issue on GitHub can be summarized as: "git_fix_stash rule fails when the command script is just 'git'". The description of the issue should include the details of the bug, the error message, and the corrected code.

After implementing the suggested fix, the function should now handle the case where the command script is just "git" and pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable values.
