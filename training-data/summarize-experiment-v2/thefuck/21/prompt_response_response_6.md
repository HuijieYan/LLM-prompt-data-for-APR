Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where the script is split and an index of 1 is accessed. This is causing an IndexError when the script is just "git" and not "git stash".

Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script will always have "stash" as the second word. This assumption leads to an IndexError when the script is just "git".

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
We can fix this bug by first checking if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we can check if the first element is "git" to ensure that we are dealing with a git command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[0] == 'git':
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code will first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 and if the first element is "git". If both conditions are true, it will then proceed to check if the second element is "stash" and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

This code will now handle the case where the script is just "git" and will not cause an IndexError. It will also ensure that it only matches git commands. After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The corrected code resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by handling the case where the script is just "git" and preventing the IndexError from occurring.
