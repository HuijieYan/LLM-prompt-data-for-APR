The bug in the `match` function is caused by directly checking the `command.script.split()[1]` without verifying if `command.script` has multiple words, which leads to a potential error if `command.script` does not contain multiple words. Additionally, the function does not effectively use the `command.stderr` information to determine the match.

To fix this bug, we should first split the `command.script` and then check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. Furthermore, we should check both conditions related to `command.stderr` more effectively to determine a match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the `command.script` contains the word "stash" and then verifies if "usage:" is in `command.stderr`. This updated logic ensures that the function does not encounter an index out of range error and effectively checks for both conditions to determine a match.

The corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it will successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.

Feel free to use this corrected function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
