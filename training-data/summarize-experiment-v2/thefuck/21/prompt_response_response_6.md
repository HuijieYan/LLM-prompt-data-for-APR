The bug in the `match` function is caused by directly splitting the command script without checking if there are enough elements to split. According to the failing test and the error message, the index error occurs when trying to access index 1 of the split command script.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to firstly check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1, and then compare the second element with 'stash' if it exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function will successfully pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git".
