The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()[1]` will always have a value, which leads to an IndexError when `command.script` does not contain any whitespace-separated values. 

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split list to access the second element. We can use the `len()` function to check the length of the split list and then access the second element if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code will first check if `script_parts` has enough elements, and then check if the second element is 'stash'. This should resolve the IndexError issue and pass the failing test.

The GitHub issue title for this bug could be "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git".
