Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the direct comparison of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split list has at least two elements.

The bug's cause is that the function does not effectively utilize `command.stderr` to determine a match, and it directly checks for `command.script.split()[1]` without verifying if there are multiple words in `command.script`.

To fix this bug, the function should first split the `command.script` and then check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`. Furthermore, the function should check both conditions related to `command.stderr` more effectively to determine a match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected version checks if the `script_words` list has at least two elements before comparing the second element to `'stash'`, and it effectively checks both conditions related to `command.stderr` to determine a match. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue related to running 'git' commands with only the word 'git'.
