The issue is caused by an IndexError in the buggy function due to assumption that there will always be a second element after splitting the command script. To fix this, we'll first check if the script being executed is 'git stash' and then if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. If all the conditions match, we'll return True, else we'll return False.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
