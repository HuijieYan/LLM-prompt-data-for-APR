The issue with the buggy function `get_new_command` is caused by incorrect detection of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the elements at the identified index. Additionally, the extraction of the remote branch name from the `stderr` output is also flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Correctly handle the detection of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, ensuring that the correct index is used for removal of the elements.
2. Update the extraction of the remote branch name from the `stderr` output by properly parsing and extracting the relevant information.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the remote branch name from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
