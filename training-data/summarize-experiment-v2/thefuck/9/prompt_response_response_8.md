The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the incorrect detection and handling of the "fatal" error message in the `stderr` response. Additionally, the logic for identifying the upstream option within the command's parts seems to be flawed. These issues lead to inconsistent results in the function's return values.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Implement a more robust error handling logic to properly detect and interpret the "fatal" errors in the `stderr` response.
2. Revise the logic for identifying the upstream option within the command's parts to ensure accurate detection.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Removing the next element since it's the argument for --set-upstream or -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if 'fatal' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function includes enhanced error handling logic and revised upstream option detection to address the issues causing the failing test cases and the reported bug. This should resolve the problems and provide consistent and accurate results for the input cases.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully address the reported GitHub issues.
