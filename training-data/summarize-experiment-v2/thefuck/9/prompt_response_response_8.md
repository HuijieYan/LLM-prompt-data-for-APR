The bug is caused by the program trying to remove an element from `command.script_parts` using an index that is out of range. This happens because the code attempts to remove the element at `upstream_option_index`, but that index is only updated if the second "try" statement runs. If the first "try" statement runs, and finds '--set-upstream', but the second "try" statement does not run, then `upstream_option_index` remains at -1. As a result, the program attempts to remove an element at index -1 from `command.script_parts`, which throws an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to ensure that if the first "try" statement runs and finds '--set-upstream', then the second "try" statement should not run. This can be achieved by using "elif" instead of "try" for the second instance. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function properly handles the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and ensures that the index is valid before trying to remove an element from `command.script_parts`.

This function will now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and should pass the failing test as well.
