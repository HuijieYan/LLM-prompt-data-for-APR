1. **Analysis**:
   - The function `get_new_command` is meant to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the input command's script parts, and then replace the 'push' command with the push destination obtained from the stderr message.
   - The failing test is comparing the returned value of `get_new_command` with the expected value for different inputs.

2. **Identifying Potential Error**:
   - The error message indicates an `IndexError` at `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, which suggests that the index `upstream_option_index` might be out of range.

3. **Elucidating the Bug's Cause**:
   - The buggy function is trying to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the index `upstream_option_index`.
   - The failing test expects that in some cases, the `get_new_command` function should return a command with `--set-upstream origin master` appended.
   - The actual input/output variables and expected input/output variables indicate that the function is not correctly updating the command.

4. **Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is not out of range before performing the pop operation. 
   - Update the logic to correctly obtain the push destination from the stderr message and construct the new command.

5. **Corrected Code**:
   Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script = command.script_parts
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        alt_index = script.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index == -1 or alt_index < upstream_option_index:
            upstream_option_index = alt_index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            script.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Above line would shift elements left
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function handles the case where the `upstream_option_index` might be out of range, and correctly constructs the new command based on the input and the stderr message.

With the corrected function, the failing test should pass and the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This should effectively resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
