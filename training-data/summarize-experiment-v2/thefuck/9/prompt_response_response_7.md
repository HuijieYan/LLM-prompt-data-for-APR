The issue lies in the `get_new_command` function, where the `upstream_option_index` variable is not being properly updated when the `-u` flag is present in the command. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the index from the `command.script_parts`.

The bug originates from the fact that the code attempts to remove elements from `command.script_parts` based on the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` without taking into account subsequent elements.

To fix the bug, you can update the logic for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and correctly updating the `upstream_option_index` variable. Additionally, the code can be improved to handle other scenario where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag might have additional arguments after it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # If there are additional arguments after the flag, remove those as well
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the cases where the `-u` flag is present along with additional arguments. It will also ensure that the index is removed along with any subsequent arguments.

After making these changes, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
