The bug is occurring in the get_new_command function in the thefuck/rules/git_push.py file. The function is failing to properly handle the stderr response from the command input, which leads to an incorrect interpretation of the command's parts and results in an IndexError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately detecting the location of the upstream option in the command's parts, leading to inconsistent values for upstream_option_index. Additionally, the error handling logic is not comprehensive enough to interpret the "fatal" errors in the stderr.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to accurately detect the upstream option and improve the error handling logic to properly interpret the "fatal" errors in the stderr. This will ensure that the function responds appropriately to the absence of an upstream reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if "fatal: The current branch" in command.stderr:
        return command.script + " --set-upstream origin master"
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function includes more accurate detection and removal of the upstream option, as well as improved error handling to address the "fatal" errors in the stderr. This version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
