The issue is caused by the `pop` method being called twice on `command.script_parts` without checking if the index actually exists. This results in an `IndexError` when the index does not exist. 

To fix the issue, we can simply check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before calling `pop` method. If it's not -1, we can safely remove the element at that index.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
