Approach for fixing the bug:
The buggy function is failing because the `pop` function is being called twice on the same index, which results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

We can fix this by using the `pop` function only once and removing the specified index from the list of `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function addressed the issue with calling `pop` function twice on the same index.

Now, the corrected function is expected to pass the failing test as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
