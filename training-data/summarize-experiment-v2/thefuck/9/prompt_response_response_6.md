The bug is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, particularly in the logic that removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at the line where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called.

Looking at the failing test, it seems that the expected output for `git push -u` is "git push --set-upstream origin master", but the function is returning an error due to the `pop` operation. This discrepancy in the expected and actual outputs is causing the test to fail.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" provides more context about the expected behavior of the function and how it has been impacted by a previous merge (#538). According to the GitHub issue, the suggested fix for the bug is to revert back to the original behavior of the function, where it would output "git push --set-upstream origin master" for the input "git push -u".

To fix the bug, the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument needs to be corrected. Additionally, the function should be modified to return the expected output for each test case.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_index = -1

    if upstream_index != -1:
        command_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove the option
        if upstream_index < len(command_parts):  # check if there is an argument to be removed
            command_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should address the bug by correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and then returning the expected output for each test case. This solution will also resolve the issue raised in the GitHub ticket.

With this approach, the `get_new_command` function will be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
