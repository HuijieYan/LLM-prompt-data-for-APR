The issue with the current implementation of the `get_new_command` function is that it doesn't handle the parsing and error detection of the `stderr` properly. This leads to incorrect detection of the upstream option and subsequently causes the `pop` function to fail due to an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to update the error handling and upstream option detection logic in the function, ensuring that it correctly detects and interprets the "fatal" errors and adjusts the output accordingly to reflect the lack of an upstream reference. Additionally, the logic for identifying the upstream option within the command's parts should be revised to prevent the consistent values of -1 or 2.

Here's the corrected version of the function incorporating the fixes:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Ensure the command has the necessary parts
    if 'push' not in command.script_parts:
        return

    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Parse the error message to determine the push upstream
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(error_lines) < 3:
        return
    push_upstream = error_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these fixes, the corrected function should now handle the error messages and upstream option detection properly, ensuring that it passes the failing tests and resolves the issues posted on GitHub.

Additionally, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, ensuring that it produces the expected results for the test cases and for the provided input parameters.

I have also added comments to explain the logic and steps in the corrected function for better understanding.

These changes should address the reported bug and provide a more reliable and accurate behavior for the `git push` command.
