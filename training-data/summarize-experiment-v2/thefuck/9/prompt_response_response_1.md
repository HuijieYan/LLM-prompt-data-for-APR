## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not handling the case when the command contains the `-u` flag correctly. The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the `pop` method is trying to remove an element from an empty list, which causes the error.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is within the bounds of the `command.script_parts` list before trying to pop the element.
2. Ensure that the correct index is being removed from the list when the `-u` flag is present.

## Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the flag
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if index is within bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle the cases when the `-u` flag is present correctly and not raise an `IndexError`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
