The bug is caused by incorrect indexing in the `get_new_command` function within the file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`, leading to an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function fails to accurately extract the remote branch name from the `stderr` output in several test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the logic to identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command's script parts and remove it.
2. Properly extract the remote branch name from the `stderr` output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function fixes the issues with incorrect indexing and inaccurate extraction of the remote branch name from the `stderr` output. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
