The issue seems to be with the pop method used to remove elements from the command.script_parts list. The function is not correctly removing the specified index, resulting in an IndexError. Additionally, the function doesn't handle the case where the '-u' flag is passed with an argument.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags and remove them along with their arguments from the command.script_parts list. We can also update the function to set the push_upstream variable based on the last line of the stderr, which contains the git command to set upstream.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        u_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if upstream_option_index == -1 or u_index < upstream_option_index:
            upstream_option_index = u_index
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

And here's the corrected failing test:

```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_push.py

def test_get_new_command(stderr):
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --set-upstream origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"

```

With these changes, the function should now handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags properly and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
