# The source code of the buggy function
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 0: # should be x > 1
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```

# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `-5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `-5`, type: `int`

## Case 2
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `0`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `0`, type: `int`

## Case 3
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `1`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `1`, type: `int`

## Case 4
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `6`, type: `int`

# Explanation:
Let's analyze the input and output values step by step.
In case 1, x is less than 0, so the function should return x. 
In case 2, x is equal to 0, so the function should return x.
In case 3, x is equal to 1, which is grater than 0, so the function returns 2, however, the expected output is 1, indicating that the function is not working properly at this case. A quick look at the function's code reveals that the condition should be x > 1 instead of x > 0.
In case 4, x is greater than 0, so the function should return x + 1.
It seems that from the expected input and output, this function should only output x + 1 when x is greater then 1.
