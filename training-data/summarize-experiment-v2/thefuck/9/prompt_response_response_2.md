The potential error in the buggy function is related to the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list. The function is trying to remove elements from the list based on the index of certain arguments (`--set-upstream` or `-u`). The error occurs when trying to pop an element from the list using the `upstream_option_index`. The problem is that the index is being used to remove elements twice, which may cause an `IndexError` if the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, the function should only pop the element once if it was found. Additionally, the index value should be used to remove the argument rather than both the argument and its value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if the index is not out of range
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the value associated with the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their associated values, avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring. This code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This fix also addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
