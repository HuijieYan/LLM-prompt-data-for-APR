In this case, the function is expected to handle the situation where the command does not contain the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. The variable upstream_option_index should be -1 in this case, indicating that the options were not found. The push_upstream variable should be extracted from the stderr and should contain the correct string value. The function should then return the result of replace_argument("git push", 'push', push_upstream).
