Potential error location: It seems that the buggy function is incorrectly removing the specified index of the script_parts list, which is causing an IndexError in some cases, as indicated by the failing test and the corresponding error message.

Bug cause: The buggy function is not handling the removal of elements from the script_parts list according to the specified index. This is resulting in an IndexError when trying to remove an element that does not exist at the specified index, which is causing the failing test.

Fix approach: The function should first check if the target element exists at the specified index before attempting to remove it to avoid the IndexError. Additionally, the function should correctly identify the push_upstream value based on the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code should now handle the removal of elements from the script_parts list correctly and derive the push_upstream value from the error message.

This corrected function is expected to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
