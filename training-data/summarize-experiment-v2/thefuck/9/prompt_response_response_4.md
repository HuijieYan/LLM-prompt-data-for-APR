The issue is occurring in the `get_new_command()` function where the `upstream_option_index` is being set incorrectly, leading to an IndexError when using `pop` to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is incorrect handling of the `-u` option, which is causing the `upstream_option_index` to be set to the wrong value, leading to an IndexError when trying to remove elements from the list.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and adjust the logic to remove the correct elements from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    has_upstream_option = False
    for i in range(len(command.script_parts)):
        if command.script_parts[i] in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            has_upstream_option = True
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            break

    if has_upstream_option:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected function should handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and remove the elements from the list as required. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This fix should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
