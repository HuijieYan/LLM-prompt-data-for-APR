The issue seems to be with the `upstream_option_index` variable and the way it is used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The error message indicates that an index out of range (IndexError) is occurring when trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts`.

The `upstream_option_index` is the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts`. It is set to -1 initially and then updated if either of the options is found in the `command.script_parts`. The problem seems to arise when the `-u` option is found because the index for `-u` is 2, and if it is popped once, the `-u` option gets removed, but not its argument.

To resolve this issue, the code can be updated to ensure that both the option and its argument are removed together. One way to do this could be to check for the presence of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and then remove both the option and the next element (its argument) from the list.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this modification, both the option and its argument will be removed if `-u` or `--set-upstream` is present in the `command.script_parts`. This change should ensure that the function now works as expected and passes the failing test case.
