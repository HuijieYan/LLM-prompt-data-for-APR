The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements at the `upstream_option_index`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and then remove them from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to correctly extract the remote and branch from the `stderr` message to construct the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    remote_and_branch = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split('--set-upstream ')[1]
    push_upstream = f"git push --set-upstream {remote_and_branch}"
    return push_upstream
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and construct the new command as expected.

This fix should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
