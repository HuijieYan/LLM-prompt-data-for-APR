The error in the code generates an `IndexError`. This occurs when the index provided to the `pop` function is out of range for the list. Therefore, the `command.script_parts` list is being accessed and manipulated outside of its bounds.

The error message points to the `git_push.py` file and shows the exact location of the error â€“ line 27 in the `git_push.py` file. The failing test file that's calling the function is also provided, which is `test_git_push.py`.

A simplified version of the error message is as follows:
```
Error: IndexError at git_push.py:27
```
