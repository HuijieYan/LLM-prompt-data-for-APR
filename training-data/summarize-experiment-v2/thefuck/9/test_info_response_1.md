The original error message reads:
```
IndexError: pop index out of range
```

The `IndexError` is caused by trying to remove an element from a list at an index that does not exist in the list, which indicates that there is an issue in the `get_new_command` function within the file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`.

The problematic code is identified as:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

These lines cause the error because the `upstream_option_index` is not updated as needed to accurately represent the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` parts of the `command.script_parts`. Therefore, when trying to remove the element referred to by `upstream_option_index`, it is attempting to remove an element that does not exist.

The failing test is `test_get_new_command` at line 26 in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`. This test case is the one that led to the specific failure from which the error message was generated.
