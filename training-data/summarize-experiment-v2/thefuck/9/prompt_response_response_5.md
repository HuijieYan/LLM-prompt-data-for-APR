The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option from the `command.script_parts` list. The function then attempts to remove the same option again, resulting in an `IndexError` because the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is removed from the `command.script_parts` list, and that the `push_upstream` variable is updated accordingly.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to only remove the option and its argument if they exist in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we should update the `push_upstream` variable based on the presence of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if there are enough parts remaining after removing the index
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub by providing the correct suggestion for the `git push -u` command.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the `get_new_command` function works as expected.
