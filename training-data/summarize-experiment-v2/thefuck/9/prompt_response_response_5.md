There are a few issues with the get_new_command function. The first issue is that when the '-u' flag is found, it is being removed from the script_parts list twice, which causes an IndexError. The second issue is that the push_upstream variable is being assigned the incorrect value.

To fix this, first remove the duplicate pop operation. Then, update the push_upstream variable to split the stderr and take the last value in order to get the correct push command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fix should resolve the IndexError and also correctly extract the push command from the stderr. This corrected version should pass the failing test and also resolve the GitHub issues.
