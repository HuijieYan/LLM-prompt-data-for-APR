The potential cause of the bug is the incorrect indexing and removal of elements in the command.script_parts list within the get_new_command function. Additionally, there is an issue with extracting the remote branch name from the stderr output.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Correctly update the upstream_option_index based on the results of both try blocks.
2. Extract the remote branch name from the stderr output using a more robust approach, such as pattern matching or parsing the output.

Here is the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the get_new_command function, the failing test cases should pass, and the function should now handle the input as expected. Additionally, the GitHub issue related to a broken suggestion for git push -u origin should also be resolved.
