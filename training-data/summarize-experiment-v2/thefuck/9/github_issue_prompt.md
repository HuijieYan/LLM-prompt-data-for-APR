GitHub Bug Title:
TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype

Description:
Using the new nullable integer data type, calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError. It works with int64 dtype and also with Int64 dtype when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy. The error occurs with median and std as well. However, it does not occur with min, max, or first.

Expected Output:
When performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of nullable integer data type (Int64), the following behaviours are expected for the specified methods:
mean(): The method should compute the mean of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
median():The method should compute the median of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
std(): The method should compute the standard deviation of grouped data without raising a TypeError.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0

Fix suggestions for git push -u origin

#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
