Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove upstream_option_index again, as it has shifted after the first pop
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function fixes the issues with incorrect index handling and accurately extracts the remote branch name from the `stderr` output. It now replaces the entire buggy version of the function and should pass the failing test cases while resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
