The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect removal of the --set-upstream or -u arguments from the `command.script_parts`. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements that don't exist in the list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the upstream options are present in the `command.script_parts` before trying to remove them. If they are present, we should remove them along with their corresponding arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function checks for the presence of --set-upstream or -u in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them. It also includes a try-except block to handle the case where the argument following the option doesn't exist.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

As for the GitHub issue, this fix should resolve the problem with the git push -u origin suggestions and should also fix the issue caused by #538.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
