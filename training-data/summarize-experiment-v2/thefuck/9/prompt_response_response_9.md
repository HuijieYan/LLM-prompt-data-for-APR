The bug is caused by the `upstream_option_index` being used to try and remove the `--set-upstream` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. However, there is an issue with the logic used to determine the `upstream_option_index` and to subsequently remove the elements from the list, which results in an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic used to determine the `upstream_option_index` and the removal of elements from the list. We will also need to update the `push_upstream` value based on the provided `stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_removed = False
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index(option)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
            upstream_removed = True
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_removed:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected code now properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `script_parts` list. It also correctly sets the `push_upstream` value based on the provided `stderr`.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
