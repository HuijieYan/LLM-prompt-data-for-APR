You have been given the source code of a function that is currently failing its test cases.

Image you are in the middle of debugging process and you have logged the variable values from this buggy function. Your mission involves analyzing each test case of runtime input/output values step by step and compare it with the core logic of the function. Using this comparisons, formulate the reason for the discrepancy and
summarise it.


# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 2
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 3
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 4
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '--set-upstream', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push --set-upstream origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 5
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '--quiet']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push --quiet, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`
