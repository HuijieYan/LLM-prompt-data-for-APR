# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
text, value: `hello world`, type: `str`
### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
result, value: `DlRoW OlLeH`, type: `str`

## Case 2
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
text, value: `abcdef`, type: `str`
### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
result, value: `FeDcBa`, type: `str`

# Explanationï¼š
The obscure_transform function applies a transformation to the input string that consists of two steps: first, it reverses the string, and then it modifies the case of every other character starting from the beginning of the reversed string. Specifically, characters in even positions are converted to uppercase, while characters in odd positions are converted to lowercase.

Let's analyze the input and output values step by step.
In the first example, the input "hello world" is reversed to "dlrow olleh". Then, starting from the first character (d), every other character is converted to uppercase, resulting in "DlRoW OlLeH".
In the second example, "abcdef" is reversed to "fedcba". Following the same transformation rule, this results in "FeDcBa", where every other character starting from f (now in uppercase) is alternated with lowercase.
