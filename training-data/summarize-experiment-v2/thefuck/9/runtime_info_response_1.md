The common observation across all test cases appears to be that the function fails to properly handle the `stderr` response from the `command` input. The presence of the "fatal" message in the `stderr` across all scenarios indicates that the branches have no upstream reference. However, the function does not seem to properly interpret this situation, as it always leads to the same response, indicating an issue with the error handling logic in the function. This is further evidenced by the fact that the `upstream_option_index` is always either -1 or 2, which suggests that the function is not correctly detecting the location of the upstream option in the command's parts.

To resolve the discrepancies in the test cases, the function would require a more comprehensive error handling logic, focusing on properly detecting and interpreting the "fatal" errors and adjusting the output accordingly to reflect the lack of an upstream reference. Additionally, the logic for identifying the upstream option within the command's parts should be revised to prevent the consistent values of -1 or 2. These modifications to the error handling and upstream option detection logic should address the failing test cases.
