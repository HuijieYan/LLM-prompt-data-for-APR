Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_push.py

def test_get_new_command(stderr):
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --set-upstream origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error in the code generates an `IndexError`. This occurs when the index provided to the `pop` function is out of range for the list. Therefore, the `command.script_parts` list is being accessed and manipulated outside of its bounds.

The error message points to the `git_push.py` file and shows the exact location of the error – line 27 in the `git_push.py` file. The failing test file that's calling the function is also provided, which is `test_git_push.py`.

A simplified version of the error message is as follows:
```
Error: IndexError at git_push.py:27
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The common observation across all test cases appears to be that the function fails to properly handle the `stderr` response from the `command` input. The presence of the "fatal" message in the `stderr` across all scenarios indicates that the branches have no upstream reference. However, the function does not seem to properly interpret this situation, as it always leads to the same response, indicating an issue with the error handling logic in the function. This is further evidenced by the fact that the `upstream_option_index` is always either -1 or 2, which suggests that the function is not correctly detecting the location of the upstream option in the command's parts.

To resolve the discrepancies in the test cases, the function would require a more comprehensive error handling logic, focusing on properly detecting and interpreting the "fatal" errors and adjusting the output accordingly to reflect the lack of an upstream reference. Additionally, the logic for identifying the upstream option within the command's parts should be revised to prevent the consistent values of -1 or 2. These modifications to the error handling and upstream option detection logic should address the failing test cases.


# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, expected value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
