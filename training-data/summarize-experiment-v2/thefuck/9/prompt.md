Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The original error message reads:
```
IndexError: pop index out of range
```

The `IndexError` is caused by trying to remove an element from a list at an index that does not exist in the list, which indicates that there is an issue in the `get_new_command` function within the file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`.

The problematic code is identified as:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

These lines cause the error because the `upstream_option_index` is not updated as needed to accurately represent the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` parts of the `command.script_parts`. Therefore, when trying to remove the element referred to by `upstream_option_index`, it is attempting to remove an element that does not exist.

The failing test is `test_get_new_command` at line 26 in `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`. This test case is the one that led to the specific failure from which the error message was generated.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input command and then replace the "push" argument with the remote branch name retrieved from the command's stderr output.

However, there are several issues causing the failing tests:
1. The code that attempts to detect the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option clearly has a bug, as it simply assigned the results of the second `try` block to `upstream_option_index` without accounting for the previous value. This leads to an incorrect index in some cases.
2. The code to extract the remote branch name from the `stderr` output fails due to inaccurate splitting and partitioning, resulting in an incorrect value being assigned to `push_upstream` in multiple test cases.

To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, the following changes need to be made:
1. Fix the logic to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the command's script parts and remove it.
2. Properly extract the remote branch name from the `stderr` output, instead of relying on fixed indices or strings. This should be done by splitting the `stderr` output and extracting the relevant portion that contains the remote branch name.

Making these changes will ensure that the function correctly modifies the input command and returns the desired new command without errors, as verified through the completed test cases.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In this case, the function is expected to handle the situation where the command does not contain the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. The variable upstream_option_index should be -1 in this case, indicating that the options were not found. The push_upstream variable should be extracted from the stderr and should contain the correct string value. The function should then return the result of replace_argument("git push", 'push', push_upstream).


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Fix suggestions for git push -u origin

Description:
After the merge of #538, the suggestion for git push -u myfork is broken. The expected output should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, but the current suggestion is hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier. Need to fix this issue.
