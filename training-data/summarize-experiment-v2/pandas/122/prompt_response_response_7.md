The issue seems to be that the `equals` function is considering the order of the blocks when checking for equality, which is causing the test to fail. The function `canonicalize` sorts the blocks based on their type name and the `mgr_locs`. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being correctly handled in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix this issue, the `mgr_locs` attribute needs to be properly handled in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their location.

Here's the corrected code for the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should correctly handle the comparison of blocks and return the expected result for the failing test case.

Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should address the issue and make the failing test case pass, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
