## Bug Analysis
The `equals()` function is comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` by consolidating the blocks, sorting them using the `canonicalize` function, and then checking if they are equal. The issue seems to arise from the ordering of blocks in `self` and `other` before checking for equality.

The failing test indicates that the function is returning True instead of False.

The `canonicalize` function is used to order the blocks, but the ordering criteria does not seem to be consistent with the comparison made in the `equals` function.

The error message "assert True is False" indicates that the buggy function is returning True when it should be False.

## Bug Cause
The blocks in `self` and `other` are being sorted using the `canonicalize` function, but the ordering of blocks according to this function is not consistent with the equality comparison made afterwards.

## Possible Approaches
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure consistent ordering of blocks for comparison.
2. Adjust the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for the ordering of blocks.

        )
```
With this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now sorts the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`, and the comparison in the `equals` function has been adjusted to use the sorted blocks for checking equality.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and return the expected result.
