Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies with the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. There might be discrepancies in the block equality check or the canonicalization process, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the block comparison logic and the canonicalization function need to be reviewed and potentially revised to properly identify differences between BlockManagers.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function should address the issue and return the expected results for comparing BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations. This version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
