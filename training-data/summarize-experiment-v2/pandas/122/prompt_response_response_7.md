The potential error in the buggy function "equals" is likely related to the comparison of different types of data structures within the "BlockManager" objects.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the comparison is made on equivalent data structures, including the "Items", "Axis 1", and "IntBlock" attributes within the "BlockManager" type for both "self" and "other" variables. The manipulation of block data and related attributes within the "BlockManager" objects needs to be handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison is made on equivalent data structures within the "BlockManager" objects, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
