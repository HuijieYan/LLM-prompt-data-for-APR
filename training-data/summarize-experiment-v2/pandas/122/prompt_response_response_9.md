The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the `canonicalize` function. This function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations, but it seems that the sorting order might not be consistent, leading to incorrect comparison results.

The cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function might not be properly handling the block's properties to ensure a consistent sorting order.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly captures the properties of the block to provide a consistent sorting order. This might involve considering additional attributes or properties of the block that are relevant to its comparison and sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the `canonicalize` function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (
        block.is_categorical(),  # Check if the block is categorical to handle them differently
        block.dtype.name, 
        block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
    )
```

You should also update the `equals` method to use the corrected `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # existing code
    # ...
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block's categorical status in the sorting process, and the `equals` method uses the correct `canonicalize` function to ensure a consistent comparison. This should address the issue and cause the failing test to pass.
