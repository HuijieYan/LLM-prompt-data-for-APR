The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it doesn't compare the blocks within the BlockManager properly. It should consider the block order and the type name, along with the manager locations, to ensure an accurate comparison.

To fix this issue, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to consider the block's dtype, as well as its manager locations, when sorting the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which
    # can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function considers the type name and manager locations when sorting and comparing the blocks, providing a more accurate comparison.

With this fix, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the `equals` function should return False for the given input, as expected.
