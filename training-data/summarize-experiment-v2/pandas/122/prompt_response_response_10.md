The bug in the equals method of the BlockManager class is likely due to an issue in comparing the blocks and their attributes within the BlockManager objects. The function currently compares the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but this may be leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function used for block comparison to consider all relevant block attributes. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison is being made on equivalent data structures and that the manipulation of block data and related attributes is handled accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining all relevant block attributes
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.items, block.axes, block._is_view)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the canonicalize function to consider all relevant block attributes, we can ensure that the comparison of BlockManager objects in the equals method is accurate.

The corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
