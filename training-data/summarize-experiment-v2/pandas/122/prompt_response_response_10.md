Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is erroneously returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

The bug is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs` to determine block order. However, different block locations should not affect the equality comparison.

To fix the bug, the sorting of the blocks should be modified, and the comparison should only consider the equality of the blocks' content, not their locations.

Here's a possible approach to fix the bug in the `equals` function:
1. Remove the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function.
2. Compare the blocks directly for equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this approach, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the blocks' content for equality, disregarding their locations.

Once this code change is implemented, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. The function should then pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
