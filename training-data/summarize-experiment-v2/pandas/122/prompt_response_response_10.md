Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies in the block comparison logic within the equals function. The blocks are being sorted and compared based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but it appears that this approach is not correctly identifying differences between the two BlockManager objects.

To fix this bug, one possible approach would be to enhance the block comparison logic to ensure that it accurately identifies differences between the blocks. This could involve comparing the actual values within the blocks, rather than relying solely on dtype name and mgr_locs.

Additionally, thorough testing and debugging will be necessary to validate the changes and ensure that the equals function behaves as expected in all relevant scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the equals function:

```python
    # Corrected version of the equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Compare actual values within the blocks for equality
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version of the equals function ensures that the blocks are compared based on their actual values for equality. This should address the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
