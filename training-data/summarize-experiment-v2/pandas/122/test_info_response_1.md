From the given error message, it is evident that the error occurred in the "test_dataframe_not_equal" function inside the "test_internals.py" file. The error specifically occurred in the line where the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is made.

The error message itself states that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, and it provides additional details showing the data contained within the `equals` method of the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`.

To simplify the error message, it can be summarized as:
- The assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.

From the provided error message, it can be inferred that there is an issue with the equality comparison of the DataFrame objects (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method. The failing assertion indicates that the expected result of `df1.equals(df2)` is False, but the actual result is True, leading to the failure of the test.
