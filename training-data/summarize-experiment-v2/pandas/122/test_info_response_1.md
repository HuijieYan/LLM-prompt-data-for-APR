Based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the error is thrown when `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is tested in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function. The error message `assert True is False` suggests that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected.

The error stack frame information indicates that the failure occurred at line 1306 in `test_internals.py`. The failure is likely due to the `equals` method not properly identifying differences between the two data frames.

In simpler terms, the failing test is asserting that two data frames are not equal, but the comparison is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method in the source code is not functioning as expected.
