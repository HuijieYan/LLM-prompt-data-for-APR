The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` objects and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method, expecting it to return False. However, the method incorrectly returns True, leading to the test failure.

Upon analyzing the function and related variables, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of the blocks. The method compares the blocks using the `equals` method, but it does not take into account the specific block type or its location.

The expected behavior should consider the type and location of the blocks when performing the comparison. It should also handle the DataFrame-specific comparison logic for handling column-wise and index-wise comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function can be modified to include block type and location information. Then, this modified function can be used to sort the blocks before comparison in the `equals` method. Additionally, the logic for comparing the axes of the `BlockManager` objects needs to be verified to ensure correct handling of the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected code now includes a modified `canonicalize` function to include block type information, and it sorts the blocks based on this modified canonicalization before comparison. Additionally, it ensures that the comparison logic takes into account the axes and block counts.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects and handle the column-wise and index-wise comparison logic, thus passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
