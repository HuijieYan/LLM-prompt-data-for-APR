The bug is likely located in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them. The issue seems to be related to the sorting algorithm used in the `canonicalize` function.

The `canonicalize` function should create a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` for each block, but the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being called correctly. This is likely causing the blocks to be sorted incorrectly, leading to the wrong comparison result in the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block and create the tuple for sorting. Additionally, the sorting algorithm may need to be adjusted to ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `canonicalize` function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
```

With this correction, the blocks will be sorted based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, ensuring that they are in the correct order for comparison in the `equals` function.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function return the expected result for the failing test.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks and return the expected result for the failing test.
