The bug in the equals function of the BlockManager class is likely caused by a mishandling of the block data and related attributes within the BlockManager objects. The function is not processing the input block data correctly, leading to discrepancies in the comparison and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic in the equals function needs to be reviewed to ensure that the manipulation of block data and related attributes is handled accurately. This may involve checking the manipulation of tuples, handling of block attributes, and the placement of block data within the BlockManager objects.

The corrected code for the equals function of the BlockManager class is provided below:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False

        return True
```

This corrected version of the equals function addresses the mishandling of block data and related attributes, ensuring that the comparison is made on equivalent data structures within the BlockManager objects. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
