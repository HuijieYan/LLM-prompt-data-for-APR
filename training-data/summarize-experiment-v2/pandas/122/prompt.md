    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

From the given error message, it is evident that the error occurred in the "test_dataframe_not_equal" function inside the "test_internals.py" file. The error specifically occurred in the line where the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is made.

The error message itself states that the assertion `assert True is False` failed, and it provides additional details showing the data contained within the `equals` method of the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`.

To simplify the error message, it can be summarized as:
- The assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.

From the provided error message, it can be inferred that there is an issue with the equality comparison of the DataFrame objects (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method. The failing assertion indicates that the expected result of `df1.equals(df2)` is False, but the actual result is True, leading to the failure of the test.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The discrepancy in the test cases is likely due to the comparison of different types of data structures. In the given input parameters, the "self" and "other" variables are of type "BlockManager", which contains "Items" and "Axis 1" attributes. These attributes include "IntBlock" and "ObjectBlock" slices with specific index ranges and data types.

At the function's return, the "block" variable seems to represent only the "IntBlock" slice, with a specific index range and data type. This discrepancy in the data structure being compared likely results in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should ensure that the comparison is being made on equivalent data structures, including the "Items", "Axis 1", and "IntBlock" attributes within the "BlockManager" type for both "self" and "other" variables.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the comparison of the expected values and types and the output of the failing function, the reason for the discrepancy could be a mishandling or incorrect manipulation of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples in the function's logic. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the block data and related attributes within the `BlockManager` objects.

The output values for `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `block.dtype`, `block`, and `block.mgr_locs` are not matching the expected values. This indicates that the function is not processing the input block data correctly or is misplacing the attributes within the `BlockManager` objects.

To address the discrepancy, the function's logic needs to be reviewed to ensure that the manipulation of block data and related attributes is handled correctly, and that the `BlockManager` objects are being processed accurately. This could involve checking the manipulation of tuples, handling of block attributes, and the placement of block data within the `BlockManager` objects.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

# Bug Title
DataFrame.equals() returns True for identical blocks with different locations

## Description
When using the DataFrame.equals() method on two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, it incorrectly returns True instead of False. This behavior is unexpected and needs to be fixed.

## Code Sample
```python
import pandas as pd

df3 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': ['s', 'd']})
df4 = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['s', 'd'], 'b': [1, 2]})
df3.equals(df4)
```

## Expected Output
I expected the DataFrame.equals() method to return False, but it is returning True.

## Environment
- Python version: 3.6.8
- Pandas version: 0.25.0
- Numpy version: 1.16.4
- Operating System: Windows 10
