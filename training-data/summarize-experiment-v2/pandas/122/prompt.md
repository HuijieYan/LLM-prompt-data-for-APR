def test_dataframe_not_equal():

    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

Based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the error is thrown when `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is tested in the `test_dataframe_not_equal` function. The error message `assert True is False` suggests that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected.

The error stack frame information indicates that the failure occurred at line 1306 in `test_internals.py`. The failure is likely due to the `equals` method not properly identifying differences between the two data frames.

In simpler terms, the failing test is asserting that two data frames are not equal, but the comparison is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method in the source code is not functioning as expected.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The equals function is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. It compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then iterates through each block in the managers to compare them.

In the provided test case, the self and other BlockManagers have the same axes but different blocks. The function first checks if the number of blocks in self and other are the same. If they're not, it returns False. Then it sorts the blocks using a canonicalize function that creates a tuple with the block's dtype and mgr_locs. After sorting the blocks, it iterates through each pair of blocks and checks if they are equal.

Based on the provided runtime values and the type of variables, it seems that the function is correctly comparing the axes and the lengths of the blocks. The issue might be with the implementation of the block equality check or the canonicalization process. 

To fix this bug, I would suggest thoroughly reviewing the block equality comparison logic and the canonicalization function to ensure that they are correctly identifying the differences between the two BlockManagers. 
Additionally, I would recommend adding some debugging print statements to understand the intermediate steps and identify where the comparison might be failing.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

It looks like the equals function is trying to compare two BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are the same, and if not, it returns False. Then it checks if all the elements in the axes are equal, and if not, it returns False. 

The function then consolidates the BlockManagers in place and compares the lengths of the blocks. If the lengths are not the same, it returns False. 

After that, the function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. It then compares each block in the sorted lists and returns False if any of them are not equal.

The expected input and output values are quite complex and involve multiple nested data structures. The inputs involve lists of Index and RangeIndex objects, as well as tuples of Block objects. The expected outputs involve lists of Index and RangeIndex objects, individual block objects, and BlockPlacement objects.

It seems that the expected output of the function is to return True if all the axes and blocks are equal between the two BlockManagers, and False otherwise. It is likely that the function is not working as expected for some input cases, and it will need to be corrected.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
DataFrame.equals() returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations

Description:
The DataFrame.equals() method returns True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but with different locations. This behavior is unexpected and should return False in such cases.

Expected Output:
When using the equals() method to compare two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, the method should return False.

Environment:
- Python: 3.6.8
- pandas: 0.25.0
- numpy: 1.16.4
- scipy: Not available
- matplotlib: 3.1.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0
