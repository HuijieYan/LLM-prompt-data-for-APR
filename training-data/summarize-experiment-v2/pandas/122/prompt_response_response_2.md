The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. However, the comparison of the `blocks` attribute is flawed because it only checks for the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and does not compare the content of the blocks.

The problem lies in the comparison of the blocks. The function uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and location, but it fails to check the content of the blocks after sorting.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function so that it compares the content of the blocks after sorting. This can be achieved by comparing the individual blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after sorting them.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This revised function first sorts the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function and then iterates through the sorted blocks to check their equality. If any block is found to be unequal, the function returns `False`.

After making these changes, the `equals` function should pass the failing test and return the expected output. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
