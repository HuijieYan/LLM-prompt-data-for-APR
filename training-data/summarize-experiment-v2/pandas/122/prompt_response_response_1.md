## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is comparing `BlockManager` objects by their axes and blocks. It then sorts the blocks to canonicalize their order and checks if all the blocks are equal. 
The bug appears to be caused by the blocks being sorted without considering their locations.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the sorting mechanism used to canonicalize the block order.

## Bug Cause
As the function iterates through the blocks and checks for equality, it does not consider the locations of the blocks. This results in wrongly returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

Failing Test:
The failing test case shows that when two DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations, the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`.

## Possible Approaches
We need to update the sorting mechanism so that it considers the locations of the blocks when checking for equality.

The corrected code modifies the sorting mechanism to consider the locations of the blocks as well as their values. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal by the `equals` function.

The corrected function satisfies both the failing test case and the expected input/output variable information. It successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
