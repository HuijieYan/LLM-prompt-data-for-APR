The bug in the function `equals` is causing it to return `True` incorrectly, even when the blocks have identical contents but with different locations. This is not the expected behavior, and it is causing the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The cause of the bug is likely in the comparison of the blocks. The function `equals` sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, and then checks if the sorted blocks are equal. However, there may be a discrepancy in the way the blocks are being sorted and compared, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the blocks and their sorting should be carefully reviewed. It's possible that the comparison based on type name and manager locations may not accurately reflect the equality of the blocks.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks. Instead of relying solely on the type name and manager locations, a more thorough comparison of the block contents could be performed. This would involve comparing the values within the blocks to ensure their equality, rather than relying on their metadata.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function, addressing the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each pair of blocks for equality
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected code, the function now compares each pair of blocks directly for equality, rather than relying solely on the type name and manager locations for sorting and comparison. This modification ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of the blocks.

After applying this correction, the `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass, and the function would satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, the GitHub issue about the incorrect equality comparison should be resolved by this fix.
