The potential error in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks and then checks if each block in `self.blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. The issue may arise when the blocks are identical, but their locations are different due to unconsolidated blocks.

The bug appears to be caused by using the `canonicalize` function to sort and compare blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting does not consider the actual block values, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, you should modify the comparison logic to consider the actual block values for equality, irrespective of their locations. You will need to iterate through the blocks and compare their values directly, rather than comparing the sorted blocks.

The corrected code for the `equals` function would be as follows:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the comparison of blocks directly checks for equality of the block values and no longer sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize`.

By making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks and return the expected results, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

After making this change, the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass, and the actual input/output variable information should match the expected input/output variable information.

This should resolve the reported bug in the `DataFrame.equals` function.
