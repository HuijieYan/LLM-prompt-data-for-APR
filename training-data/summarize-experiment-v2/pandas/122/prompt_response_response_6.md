Based on the analysis, it appears that the bug in the `equals` function is related to the incorrect handling of block data and its related attributes within the `BlockManager` objects. To fix this bug, the function's logic needs to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure accurate processing of block data and related attributes.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    
    Manage a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays. Essentially it's a
    lightweight blocked set of labeled data to be manipulated by the DataFrame
    public API class
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    shape
    ndim
    axes
    values
    items
    
    Methods
    -------
    set_axis(axis, new_labels)
    copy(deep=True)
    
    get_dtype_counts
    get_ftype_counts
    get_dtypes
    get_ftypes
    
    apply(func, axes, block_filter_fn)
    
    get_bool_data
    get_numeric_data
    
    get_slice(slice_like, axis)
    get(label)
    iget(loc)
    
    take(indexer, axis)
    reindex_axis(new_labels, axis)
    reindex_indexer(new_labels, indexer, axis)
    
    delete(label)
    insert(loc, label, value)
    set(label, value)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    
    Notes
    -----
    This is *not* a public API class
    """

    # The corrected equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block._get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison is made on equivalent data structures, including the "Items", "Axis 1", and "IntBlock" attributes within the `BlockManager` objects.

The corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information while resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
