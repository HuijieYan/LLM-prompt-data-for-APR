The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the block equality check or the canonicalization process.

The cause of the bug can be identified based on the provided information:
  (a). The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects by first checking if the axes are equal and then comparing each block in the managers.
  (b). The class `BlockManager` is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
  (c). The related functions include `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize`.
  (d). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that two data frames are not equal, but the comparison is evaluating to `True` instead of `False`.
  (e). The corresponding error message is `assert True is False`.
  (f). The actual input/output variable value is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False`.
  (g). The expected input/output variable value is for the `equals` method to return `False` when comparing two BlockManager objects with identical blocks but different locations.
  (h). The GitHub issue reports that the `equals` method returns True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which is unexpected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include thoroughly reviewing the block equality comparison logic and the canonicalization function, adding debugging print statements, and comparing how blocks are being sorted and compared.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
