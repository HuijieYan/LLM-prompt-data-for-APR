The issue with the `equals` function seems to be related to how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality, particularly when they have different locations. To fix this, we need to modify the `equals` function to correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.is_slice_like))
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the type name and a tuple of `mgr_locs.is_slice_like` to properly distinguish blocks that have different locations. This should address the issue of incorrectly returning `True` when comparing blocks with different locations.

By making this change, the corrected `equals` function should now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations, resolving the issue and passing the failing test case.
