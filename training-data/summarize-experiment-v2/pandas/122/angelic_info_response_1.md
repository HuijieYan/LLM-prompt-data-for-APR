Based on the comparison of the expected values and types and the output of the failing function, the reason for the discrepancy could be a mishandling or incorrect manipulation of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples in the function's logic. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the block data and related attributes within the `BlockManager` objects.

The output values for `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `block.dtype`, `block`, and `block.mgr_locs` are not matching the expected values. This indicates that the function is not processing the input block data correctly or is misplacing the attributes within the `BlockManager` objects.

To address the discrepancy, the function's logic needs to be reviewed to ensure that the manipulation of block data and related attributes is handled correctly, and that the `BlockManager` objects are being processed accurately. This could involve checking the manipulation of tuples, handling of block attributes, and the placement of block data within the `BlockManager` objects.
