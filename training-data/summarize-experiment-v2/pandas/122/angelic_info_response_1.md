It looks like the equals function is trying to compare two BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are the same, and if not, it returns False. Then it checks if all the elements in the axes are equal, and if not, it returns False. 

The function then consolidates the BlockManagers in place and compares the lengths of the blocks. If the lengths are not the same, it returns False. 

After that, the function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and mgr_locs. It then compares each block in the sorted lists and returns False if any of them are not equal.

The expected input and output values are quite complex and involve multiple nested data structures. The inputs involve lists of Index and RangeIndex objects, as well as tuples of Block objects. The expected outputs involve lists of Index and RangeIndex objects, individual block objects, and BlockPlacement objects.

It seems that the expected output of the function is to return True if all the axes and blocks are equal between the two BlockManagers, and False otherwise. It is likely that the function is not working as expected for some input cases, and it will need to be corrected.
