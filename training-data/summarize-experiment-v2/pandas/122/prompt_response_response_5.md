Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error lies in the comparison of the block data in the `equals` function. It is not properly handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Bug's cause:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class tries to compare the blocks contained in the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. In the failing test scenario, the blocks have the same data but different locations (due to slicing), causing the comparison to fail.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. When comparing blocks, the equality should also account for the block locations.
2. The comparison logic should check the block data and their locations to determine equality.
3. The `canonicalize` function takes care of sorting the blocks based on their data and locations, so this logic can be utilized in the equality check.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and canonicalize(block) == canonicalize(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code now incorporates the `canonicalize` function in the equality check to account for block locations when comparing blocks. It also compares the computed canonical form of the blocks to ensure that they have the same data and locations. This approach resolves the issue and would satisfy the failing test and the GitHub issue.
