The discrepancy in the test cases is likely due to the comparison of different types of data structures. In the given input parameters, the "self" and "other" variables are of type "BlockManager", which contains "Items" and "Axis 1" attributes. These attributes include "IntBlock" and "ObjectBlock" slices with specific index ranges and data types.

At the function's return, the "block" variable seems to represent only the "IntBlock" slice, with a specific index range and data type. This discrepancy in the data structure being compared likely results in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should ensure that the comparison is being made on equivalent data structures, including the "Items", "Axis 1", and "IntBlock" attributes within the "BlockManager" type for both "self" and "other" variables.
