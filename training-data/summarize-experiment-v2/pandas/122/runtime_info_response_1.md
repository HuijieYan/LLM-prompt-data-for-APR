The equals function is used to check if two BlockManager objects are equal. It compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then iterates through each block in the managers to compare them.

In the provided test case, the self and other BlockManagers have the same axes but different blocks. The function first checks if the number of blocks in self and other are the same. If they're not, it returns False. Then it sorts the blocks using a canonicalize function that creates a tuple with the block's dtype and mgr_locs. After sorting the blocks, it iterates through each pair of blocks and checks if they are equal.

Based on the provided runtime values and the type of variables, it seems that the function is correctly comparing the axes and the lengths of the blocks. The issue might be with the implementation of the block equality check or the canonicalization process. 

To fix this bug, I would suggest thoroughly reviewing the block equality comparison logic and the canonicalization function to ensure that they are correctly identifying the differences between the two BlockManagers. 
Additionally, I would recommend adding some debugging print statements to understand the intermediate steps and identify where the comparison might be failing.
