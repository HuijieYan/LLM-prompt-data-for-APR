Based on the analysis of the buggy function, it seems the issue might be with the block equality comparison logic or the canonicalization process. Additionally, the function checks the lengths and axes of the blocks correctly, so the issue might be with the comparison of the individual blocks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and debug the block equality comparison logic to ensure it correctly identifies differences between the blocks.
2. Thoroughly review and test the canonicalization process to ensure it accurately sorts the blocks for comparison.
3. Add some debugging print statements to understand the intermediate steps and identify where the comparison might be failing.
4. Consider comparing the blocks using a different approach to ensure that differences are accurately identified.
5. Refactor the equals function to use a more robust comparison strategy to handle cases with identical blocks but different locations.

Here is the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.index)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues and should fix the bug. It includes proper sorting and comparison of the blocks, taking into account the block dtype and mgr_locs.index for canonicalization. This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
