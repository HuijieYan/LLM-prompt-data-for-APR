The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the way the levels of the MultiIndex are handled, particularly in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line tries to get the level number for each item in `clocs` but seems to be failing when the level is specified as a tuple.

The issue is likely caused by the way the function expects to receive the levels. The levels are currently expected to be passed as individual level names, but in some test cases, they are being passed as tuples.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying how the levels are handled, changing the way the `_get_level_number` function is called, or updating the function to handle tuple names. Additionally, the function should be adapted to handle both single level names and tuple names.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc[0]))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function handles both single level names and tuple names and should be able to pass the failing test cases. It also takes into account the expected and actual input/output variable information provided.

This fix is expected to resolve the issue and satisfy the requirements outlined in the GitHub issue.
