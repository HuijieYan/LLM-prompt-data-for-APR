The failing test case indicated that the returned values did not match the expected ones. The core logic is expected to produce a specific set of values for the variables right before the buggy function's return. However, the actual output does not match these expected values, leading to test case failure. This discrepancy indicates that there is an issue in the computational process of the function, leading to incorrect variable values.
