The given code is quite extensive and complex, and it's difficult to thoroughly analyze and fix it based on the expected value and type of variables alone. It involves multiple steps and data manipulations that might require a more in-depth understanding of the pandas library and the specific context in which this function is used.

In order to fix the issue, I recommend a thorough review of the entire function, including each step and data transformation. Additionally, comprehensive testing and debugging should be conducted to ensure that the function works as expected in different scenarios.

It's also important to consider the specific use case and requirements for this function, as the desired behavior might vary based on the context in which it's used.

In conclusion, the complexity of the code and the specific requirements for its behavior indicate that a more detailed and comprehensive approach is necessary to fix the function.
