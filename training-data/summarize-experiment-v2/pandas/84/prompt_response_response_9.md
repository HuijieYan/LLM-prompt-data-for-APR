## Bug Analysis

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing when the `unstack` function is called with a tuple name in the `MultiIndex`. The failing test cases involve the use of MultiIndex from different combinations of levels, and these tests are failing with a `KeyError` indicating that a certain level is not found.

The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This error is related to looking up the level number from the index, and it seems to be failing when dealing with tuple names in the MultiIndex.

The failing tests provide input data and expected output, but since the buggy function is failing, the expected output is not being generated correctly.

The GitHub issue also provides information about the error and where it's occurring. The error occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names, and it throws a `KeyError` because it's unable to find the level in the MultiIndex.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug seems to be related to the way the function is handling tuple names in the MultiIndex. It's not correctly identifying the level numbers for these tuple names, which causes a `KeyError` when trying to unstack.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex. This involves properly identifying the level numbers for tuple names and then unstacking the MultiIndex based on the identified level numbers.

## Revised Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    
    if all(isinstance(level, (str, tuple)) for level in clocs):
        # If all the clocs are string or tuple types, this indicates tuple names in the MultiIndex
        cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        clocs = [cnames.index(level) for level in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    
    if all(isinstance(level, (str, tuple)) for level in clocs):
        # If all the clocs are string or tuple types, this indicates tuple names in the MultiIndex
        group_index = get_group_index(index.codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    else:
        group_index = get_group_index([index.codes[i] for i in clocs], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [index.codes[i] for i in clocs], xnull=False)

    # Unstacking logic and other code remains the same...
}

```

This revised function now includes a conditional check to identify if the `clocs` contain string or tuple types, indicating tuple names in the MultiIndex. Based on this identification, the code then adjusts the further logic for handling tuple names within the MultiIndex.

With this fix, the function should be able to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex and alleviate the `KeyError` issue.

This fix should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
