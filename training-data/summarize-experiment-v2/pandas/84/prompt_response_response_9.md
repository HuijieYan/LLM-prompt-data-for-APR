## Bug Analysis

The bug seems to be related to the `clocs` variable and its usage in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The variable `clocs` is being used to identify levels in the index, and it seems that the representation of the levels in `clocs` is causing issues.

After analyzing the failing test cases and error message, it appears that the `clocs` variable must be processed differently when dealing with MultiIndex with tuple names, such as `('A', 'a')`.

It seems that the `_get_level_number` function from the `pandas\core\indexes\multi.py` file is not handling the tuple names correctly. This results in a KeyError with the message "Level 'A' not found".

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is the incorrect processing of the `clocs` variable, especially when it contains tuples representing index levels. This leads to an error when trying to retrieve level numbers from the index. The issue originates from the interaction of the `_unstack_multiple` function and the MultiIndex with tuple names.

## Possible Approaches

1. Ensure that the function can handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.
2. Adjust the processing of the `clocs` variable to accommodate tuple names in the index.
3. Update the function to handle tuple names as expected and prevent errors such as "Level 'A' not found".

## Bug Fix

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue described:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Updated handling of 'clocs' to support tuple names
    if all(isinstance(cloc, tuple) for cloc in clocs):
        levels = list(index.names)
        cloc_numbers = [levels.index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle the `clocs` variable correctly, even when it contains tuples representing index levels. This should resolve the reported issue.

By implementing this fix, the corrected function should now be able to pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
