Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The first error message stack frame indicates the error occurred in the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` function, on line 345 of the `pandas/tests/frame/test_reshape.py` file, while the second error message indicates the error occurred in the `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` function, on line 406 of the same file. Both of these correspond to tests calling the `df.unstack` function with different data.

Simplified error messages:
1. ValueError: 'A' is not in list in the `_get_level_number` method of `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py`.
2. KeyError: 'Level A not found' in the `_get_level_number` method of `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py`.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The given runtime values and types of variables for the provided cases indicate that the `_unstack_multiple` function fails to correctly handle the input and generate the expected output. The logic of the function appears to be complex and involves working with MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns. Based on the runtime values and types, it seems that there is a bug in the function related to handling MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns when unstacking the data.

To effectively fix the bug, the function needs to be carefully analyzed and debugged to ensure that it handles MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns correctly in the unstacking process. This might involve reviewing the logic for generating new levels, names, and codes, as well as ensuring that the unstacking process is correctly performed for different types of input data. Additionally, testing with a variety of input data and edge cases can help identify and address any potential issues in the function.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The given code is quite extensive and complex, and it's difficult to thoroughly analyze and fix it based on the expected value and type of variables alone. It involves multiple steps and data manipulations that might require a more in-depth understanding of the pandas library and the specific context in which this function is used.

In order to fix the issue, I recommend a thorough review of the entire function, including each step and data transformation. Additionally, comprehensive testing and debugging should be conducted to ensure that the function works as expected in different scenarios.

It's also important to consider the specific use case and requirements for this function, as the desired behavior might vary based on the context in which it's used.

In conclusion, the complexity of the code and the specific requirements for its behavior indicate that a more detailed and comprehensive approach is necessary to fix the function.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:
The issue is stating that when performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of nullable integer data type (Int64), computing the mean, median, or std results in a TypeError. This happens in the newer version, but the same computation works with the older version.
