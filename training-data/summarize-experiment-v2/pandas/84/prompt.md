Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error occurs within the `_get_level_number(self, level) -> int` function inside the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas core reshape file. It is triggered by an attempt to access an index that is not present in the given `clocs`. 

The error messages indicate that an exception was caught while handling a previous exception. It is also shown that the error is present in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file.

The error is simplified to: `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`, but is also related to a second exception of `KeyError: 'Level A not found'.

In summary, the error is due to `Level A` not being found in the multi-index, and ultimately this exception stems from the attempt to unstack a multi-index DataFrame.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the given runtime input/output values, the discrepancies in the function's failing test cases can be summarized as follows:

Case 1:
The function allows for multi-level indexing and unstacking of data, organizing the values in a structured manner. The issue here is related to the indexes, levels, codes, and names of the data. The discrepancy is likely due to a misinterpretation or mishandling of the index and its associated properties within the function. The function is not properly handling the multiindex, leading to incorrect manipulation and unstacking of the data.

Case 2:
Similar to Case 1, the function mishandles the multi-level index, causing incorrect reshaping of the data. The incorrect treatment of the index codes and levels likely results in the failed test cases. The issue lies in the function's ability to correctly interpret and manipulate the multiindex data structure, leading to incorrect unstacking and reshaping of the data.

Case 3:
Once again, the mishandling of the multi-level index and its properties seems to be the root cause of the discrepancy. The function should correctly handle the index levels, codes, and names in order to perform accurate unstacking and reshaping of the data. The failure to do so results in incorrect manipulation and representation of the data.

In conclusion, the core logic of the function is inadequately handling the multi-level index and its properties, leading to the incorrect manipulation and reshaping of the data. This mishandling of the multiindex structure results in the failing test cases. Fixing the bug would involve addressing the function's ability to correctly interpret and manipulate the multi-level index, ensuring accurate unstacking and reshaping of the data.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The failing test case indicated that the returned values did not match the expected ones. The core logic is expected to produce a specific set of values for the variables right before the buggy function's return. However, the actual output does not match these expected values, leading to test case failure. This discrepancy indicates that there is an issue in the computational process of the function, leading to incorrect variable values.
