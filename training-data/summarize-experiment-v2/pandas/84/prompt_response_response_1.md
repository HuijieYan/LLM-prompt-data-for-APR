Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the code that deals with identifying the level numbers from the index. The error message "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the names list.

The cause of this bug can be attributed to the way the function processes the levels and codes of the index, leading to a situation where the required level is not found when trying to unstack the data.

To fix this issue, you can modify the way the function processes the levels and codes of the index, ensuring that the required level is correctly identified. You may also need to update the way the unstacking operation is performed to handle the MultiIndex structure correctly.

Once these modifications are made, the function should be able to correctly unstack the data without encountering the "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" issue.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the code that deals with identifying the level numbers from the index to ensure that the required level is correctly identified.
2. Update the unstacking operation to handle the MultiIndex structure correctly, ensuring that all levels are accounted for.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(ccodes[0], name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [ccodes[0]],
            codes=rcodes + [ccodes[1]],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in ccodes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should address the issues that caused the failing test and the GitHub issue.
