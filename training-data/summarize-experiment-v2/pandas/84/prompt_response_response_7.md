## Bug Cause

The likely cause of the bug is that `index._get_level_number(i)` is not able to find the level specified in the MultiIndex object. This leads to a KeyError being raised with the message "Level A not found".

The failing test cases are using MultiIndex objects with tuple names like ("A", "a") and the bug is specifically occurring when unstacking MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

## Bug Location

The bug is likely located in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it tries to access the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. 

## Potential Fix

One potential fix for this bug could be to ensure that the tuple names are properly handled when unstacking MultiIndex objects. This may involve changing the way level numbers are extracted and ensuring that tuple names are correctly referenced within the MultiIndex object.

## Proposed Fix

Here's the proposed fix for the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex unstacking with tuple names:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix includes a check for whether the given `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, it retrieves the index of the tuple names from the MultiIndex. This should address the issue of "Level A not found" when dealing with tuple names in the MultiIndex object.

## Updated Buggy Function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix modifies the way levels are extracted based on whether the `clocs` parameter is a tuple or not, to better handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

This fix should address the KeyError issue when unstacking MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

By incorporating this fix, we can ensure that the failing test cases pass and the identified bug is resolved.
