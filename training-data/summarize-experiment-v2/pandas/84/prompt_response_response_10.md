The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the use of tuple names in the MultiIndex, causing a KeyError when trying to retrieve the level number from the index.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names in clocs to a list of level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and resolve the KeyError issue.

Please ensure to run the failing test cases to confirm that the corrected function passes all the tests.
