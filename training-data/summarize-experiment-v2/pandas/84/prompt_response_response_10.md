The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a multi-level index dataframe. It's called by the `unstack` function and is used to handle MultiIndexes. The failing test cases are related to unstacking a DataFrame with MultiIndexes and tuple names.

The error is caused by missing levels in the MultiIndex. When `clocs` includes a tuple of level names, the function doesn't correctly handle the MultiIndex object and results in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to properly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Check if the names in `clocs` are present in the MultiIndex. If not, handle this case gracefully and return an error message.
- Handle the unstacking of MultiIndex with tuple names appropriately, ensuring that all levels are correctly accounted for.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly and pass the failing test cases.

This fix should address the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" and resolve the unstacking issues related to MultiIndexes.
