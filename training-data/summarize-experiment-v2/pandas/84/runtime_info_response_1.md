The given runtime values and types of variables for the provided cases indicate that the `_unstack_multiple` function fails to correctly handle the input and generate the expected output. The logic of the function appears to be complex and involves working with MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns. Based on the runtime values and types, it seems that there is a bug in the function related to handling MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns when unstacking the data.

To effectively fix the bug, the function needs to be carefully analyzed and debugged to ensure that it handles MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns correctly in the unstacking process. This might involve reviewing the logic for generating new levels, names, and codes, as well as ensuring that the unstacking process is correctly performed for different types of input data. Additionally, testing with a variety of input data and edge cases can help identify and address any potential issues in the function.
