The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to have issues with handling MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns when unstacking the data. This results in errors related to level numbers and key errors.

To fix the bug, a thorough review and debugging of the function is necessary to ensure it correctly handles MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns. This might involve analyzing the logic for generating new levels, names, and codes, as well as ensuring the unstacking process is performed correctly for different types of input data. Comprehensive testing and debugging should be conducted to guarantee the function's correct behavior in various scenarios.

Given the complexity and specific requirements of the function, a more detailed and comprehensive approach is needed to resolve the issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the mentioned bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if hasattr(index, "_get_level_number") else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

Please note that this code is a proposed fix for the buggy function and should be thoroughly tested to ensure it resolves the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
