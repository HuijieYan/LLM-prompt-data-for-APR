This is an output of a failing test on a pandas library function. The error message says that "KeyError: 'Level A not found'". This error is raised by the function ' _get_level_number' in the 'pandas/core/indexes/multi.py' file, when the 'level' or 'A' value is not found in the names list.

The failing test occurred because a key value was missing from the MultiIndex object.

To simplify this error message, the problem is likely due to the missing 'A' level in the MultiIndex.
