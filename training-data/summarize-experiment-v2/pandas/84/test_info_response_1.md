The error message first shows the error encountered due to the failing test cases. It displays a ValueError indicating that 'A' is not in the list, along with the stack trace and context of its occurrence in the function `_get_level_number` of the `pandas\core\indexes\multi.py` file.

Further down, another failure exception is captured from a different test case. It shows a ValueError indicating that 'A' is not in the list, along with the stack trace and context of its occurrence in the function `_get_level_number` of the `pandas\core\indexes\multi.py` file.

Based on the error messages, the original error message can be simplified as:

`ValueError: 'A' is not in list`

It is related to the code within the `_get_level_number` function of the `pandas\core\indexes\multi.py` file being unable to find the specified level ('A') in the list.
