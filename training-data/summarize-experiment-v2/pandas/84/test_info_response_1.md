The error occurs within the `_get_level_number(self, level) -> int` function inside the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas core reshape file. It is triggered by an attempt to access an index that is not present in the given `clocs`. 

The error messages indicate that an exception was caught while handling a previous exception. It is also shown that the error is present in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file.

The error is simplified to: `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`, but is also related to a second exception of `KeyError: 'Level A not found'.

In summary, the error is due to `Level A` not being found in the multi-index, and ultimately this exception stems from the attempt to unstack a multi-index DataFrame.
