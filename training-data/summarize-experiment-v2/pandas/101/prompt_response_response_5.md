The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is causing it to fail to raise a `ValueError` as expected in the failing test. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integer datatype.

After analyzing the function and the failing test, it seems that the potential error location within the function is the block of code where it checks for NaT values and tries to convert them to an integer datatype. It appears that the function is not handling this conversion correctly, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the improper handling of NaN values and the incorrect conversion of NaT values to integer datatype. This is further supported by the failing test and the detailed description provided in the GitHub issue. The function is not ensuring that the proper handling of NaN and NaT values is occurring during the dtype conversion process.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle NaN and NaT values more effectively when converting to integer datatype. Specifically, it needs to ensure that NaN and NaT values are handled appropriately as part of the integer datatype conversion process.

The corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function should address the NaN and NaT value conversion issue, pass the failing test, and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

The corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Existing code ...

    # New code to handle NaN and NaT values
    if not np.any(np.isnat(arr)):  # Check for NaT values
        if dtype == np.int64:  # Convert NaT to NaN for integer datatype
            arr[np.isnat(arr)] = np.nan
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # Existing code ...
```

With this updated code, the `astype_nansafe` function should handle NaN and NaT values more effectively, ensuring that they are converted to the appropriate datatype without raising a `ValueError`. This fix should address the failing test and the GitHub issue, resolving the bug.
