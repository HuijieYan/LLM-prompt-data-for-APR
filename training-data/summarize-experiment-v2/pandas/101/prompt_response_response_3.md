The issue seems to be related to converting categorical data to integer data and handling NaN values correctly. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is checking if the `astype_nansafe` function raises a `ValueError` with a specific error message when converting NaN values from datetime or timedelta to integer. The error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" indicates that the function failed to raise the `ValueError` as expected in this scenario.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue might be caused by the conversions involving NaN values in the `astype_nansafe` function. Specifically, the handling of NaN values during conversions from datetime or timedelta to integer may be incorrect, leading to the failure of the test case.

To address this issue, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be updated to handle NaN values appropriately when converting from datetime or timedelta to integer. Additionally, the check for NaN values and the subsequent conversions should be modified to ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add specific conditions to handle NaN values during the datetime or timedelta to integer conversions. This may involve checking for NaN values before performing the conversion and handling them separately to ensure that the function raises the expected `ValueError` with the correct error message.

Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function to address the issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Existing code...

    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        # Existing code...

        # if we have a datetime/timedelta array of objects
        # then coerce to a proper dtype and recall astype_nansafe
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            if isna(arr):
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            else:
                from pandas import to_datetime
                return astype_nansafe(to_datetime(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            if isna(arr):
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            else:
                from pandas import to_timedelta
                return astype_nansafe(to_timedelta(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)

    # Remaining code...

```

In the corrected code, specific conditions have been added to handle NaN values during the conversions from datetime or timedelta to integer. The check for NaN values is performed before initiating the conversion, and if a NaN value is encountered, the function raises a `ValueError` with the appropriate error message.

With these changes, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test case and behave as expected, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
