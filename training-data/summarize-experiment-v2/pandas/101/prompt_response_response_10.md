The issue with the `astype_nansafe` function is likely related to the handling of NaN values when casting to an integer dtype. The failing test case is checking for a ValueError that should be raised when attempting to convert NaT (Not-a-Time) values to an integer. The code is not handling this case properly, which results in the failing test.

To fix this issue, the function likely needs to include additional checks and specific handling for NaN values when casting to integer dtypes. This will ensure that the function raises a ValueError when attempting to convert NaN values to an integer, as expected.

Additionally, the GitHub issue related to converting from categorical to int values and ignoring NaNs may also be relevant to this bug. The issue describes unexpected behavior when converting categorical NaN values to integer.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Add specific handling for NaN values when casting to integer dtypes in the `astype_nansafe` function.
2. Ensure that the function raises a ValueError when attempting to convert NaN values to an integer.
3. Review the GitHub issue related to converting from categorical to int values and consider if the fix for this bug addresses that issue as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isobject(arr) and is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        return arr.cat._categorical.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    if is_float(arr) and is_integer(dtype):
        # Check for NaN values and raise an error
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and is_integer(dtype):
        # Handle datetime64 to integer conversion
        # Ensure proper handling of NaN values
        # Return the result

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_integer(dtype):
        # Handle timedelta64 to integer conversion
        # Ensure proper handling of NaN values
        # Return the result

    # ... (rest of the original code)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

Please note that the corrected function includes placeholder comments where specific handling for NaN and categorical types would need to be added based on the existing pandas library structure. Additional implementation detail would be needed to complete the fix based on the existing codebase.
