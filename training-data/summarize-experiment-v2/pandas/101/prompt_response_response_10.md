The potential error in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaN values when casting to an integer type. The failing test case is specifically focused on the behavior when attempting to cast NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer, and the error message indicates that the function did not raise a ValueError as expected.

The form of the failing test function is as follows:
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("val", [np.datetime64("NaT"), np.timedelta64("NaT")])
@pytest.mark.parametrize("typ", [np.int64])
def test_astype_nansafe(val, typ):
    arr = np.array([val])

    msg = "Cannot convert NaT values to integer"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=msg):
        astype_nansafe(arr, dtype=typ)
```
The `astype_nansafe` function attempts to convert the input array to the specified dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test case is focused on cases where the input `arr` contains NaT values, and it's expecting the function to raise a ValueError with a specific error message.

The issue seems to stem from the incorrect handling of NaN values when casting to an integer type, particularly for datetime and timedelta arrays. The error message suggests that the function does not handle this case correctly, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that it correctly handles NaN values when casting to an integer type. This may involve updating the logic for datetime and timedelta arrays, as well as incorporating proper checks for NaN values in the input array.

A corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function that resolves the bug and passes the failing test case would need to accurately handle NaN values when casting to an integer type, specifically for datetime and timedelta arrays.

Here is a possible corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (previous function body)

    elif is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(arr):
            arr = pd.to_datetime(arr.values) if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) else pd.to_timedelta(arr.values)
          
        if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and is_integer(dtype) and not skipna:
            # Handle datetime64 NaN values when casting to an integer type
            if isna(arr).any(): 
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
          
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... (remaining function body)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle datetime64 NaN values when casting to an integer type, and ensure that the ValueError is raised as expected in the failing test case. This updated logic should resolve the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
