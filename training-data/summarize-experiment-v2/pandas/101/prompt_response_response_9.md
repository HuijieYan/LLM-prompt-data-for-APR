The buggy function "astype_nansafe" in the "pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py" file is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test for this function checks for the specific error condition where the function should raise a ValueError when attempting to convert "NaT" values to an integer.

Based on the failing test, the expected behavior of the function is to raise a ValueError when trying to convert "NaT" values to an integer dtype. The issue might be caused by the way the function handles "NaT" values for integer conversions.

To resolve this issue, the function should be modified to handle "NaT" values as a special case when casting to integer types. Making these changes will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the function "astype_nansafe":

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime_data) and dtype == np.int64:
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In this corrected version, a check is added to raise a ValueError if "NaT" values are present in the input array and the target dtype is "int64". This change ensures that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

With this correction, the function should now yield the expected behavior, pass the failing test, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
