In these cases, the function `astype_nansafe` is expected to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The expected output for each case is the expected value and type of the `dtype` variable right before the function's return.

In the provided code, the function checks for different conditions and data types, such as extension array dtype, string-type, datetime, timedelta, floating point, and object dtype, and performs different operations accordingly. For example, it constructs array type for extension array dtype, converts to string dtype for string-type, handles datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype, and performs other operations based on specific conditions.

The expected value of the `dtype` variable is based on the input parameters and the operations performed within the function. It is crucial to ensure that the function returns the correct `dtype` value and type according to the specified cases.

The function logic should be revised and corrected to ensure that it returns the expected `dtype` value and type for the given input parameters in all relevant cases.
