The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The bug occurs when trying to cast categorical values with NaNs to an integer dtype. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is checking if the function raises a ValueError when given specific input parameters.

The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function is when handling the case for converting categorical values to an integer dtype. This is inferred from the failing test, which expects a ValueError to be raised when performing such a conversion.

The cause of the bug can be identified by examining the failing test, which expects the function to raise a ValueError under specific conditions. The failing test also provides insight into the expected behavior of the function when converting specific data types.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the conversion of categorical values with NaNs to an integer dtype correctly. This may involve adding additional checks and error handling specifically for this case.

The corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function will need to address the issue with converting categorical values with NaNs to an integer dtype. The corrected function should pass the failing test by raising a ValueError as expected when given specific input parameters.

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if arr.dtype.name == 'category' and np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert categorical values with NaNs to an integer dtype")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been introduced to raise a ValueError when trying to convert categorical values with NaNs to an integer dtype. This addresses the specific issue highlighted in the failing test and aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
