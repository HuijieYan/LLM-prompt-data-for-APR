The error messages are indicating that the `astype_nansafe` function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected. This occurs at lines 723 and 723 in the file `pandas/tests/dtypes/test_common.py`. The test is checking for the specific case when the input array contains "NaT" (Not a Time) values and should raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". However, the function is not raising the expected error, resulting in the test failure.

To simplify the original error message, we can summarize it as: "Failed to raise a ValueError when attempting to convert NaT values to integer".
