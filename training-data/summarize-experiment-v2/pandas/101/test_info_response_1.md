The original error message is "E Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>". This error message occurs in the failing test file in the "test_astype_nansafe" test function. It indicates that the test failed because the "astype_nansafe" function did not raise a ValueError as expected.

The failing test case provides the error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", which helps to understand the specific error condition that the test is checking for.

To simplify the original error message:
- The "astype_nansafe" function did not raise a ValueError as expected in the test_astype_nansafe test function.
