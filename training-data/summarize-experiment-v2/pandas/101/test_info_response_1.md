The error message is indicating that the `astype_nansafe` function failed to raise a `ValueError` as expected. The relevant stack frames are in the failing test file `pandas/tests/dtypes/test_common.py` on line 723, which calls the `astype_nansafe` function with certain input parameters and checks if it raises a `ValueError` with a specific error message.

The error message can be simplified as follows:
```
Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>
```
