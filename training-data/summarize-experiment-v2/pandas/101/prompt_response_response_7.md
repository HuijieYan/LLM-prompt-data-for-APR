The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `astype_nansafe` function does not handle `NaN` values properly when converting to integer types. This leads to an unexpected large negative integer value when trying to convert categorical series back into an integer column.

The cause of the bug can be identified by the failing test case, which tests the conversion of a `NaN` value in a categorical series to an integer. The specific part of the code that handles this conversion in the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be investigated. It is also apparent from the failing test that the error is caused by the function failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" provides a clear problem description and code sample, indicating that the conversion of categorical series with `NaN` values to integers results in unexpected negative values.

To fix this bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be modified to handle `NaN` values correctly when converting to integer types, ensuring that it raises a `ValueError` when encountering `NaN` values in certain conversions.

The corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function should include handling for `NaN` values when converting to integer types, and should ensure that it properly raises a `ValueError` in such cases. The corrected code should pass the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.

Here's an example of how the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function might look:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    """

    # (existing code...)

    if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(dtype) and isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # (existing code...)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This corrected code checks if the array is of categorical type, and if the desired conversion is to an integer type, it explicitly raises a `ValueError` if any `NaN` values are present in the categorical array.

By implementing this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle conversions from categorical to integer types with `NaN` values correctly, and the failing test case should be resolved. This fix should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
