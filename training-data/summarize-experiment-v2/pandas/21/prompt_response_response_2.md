In the corrected version of the function, the `key_type` is determined accurately based on the type of the key being passed. The conditions for handling different key types are updated accordingly to ensure that the function behaves as intended for all input cases.

Additionally, the logic for determining the `key_type` now takes into account the various types of keys that can be passed to the function, and sets the `key_type` based on the type of the input key.

This corrected version of the function should accurately handle different types of keys for indexing a Series and should pass the failing test. It also aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
