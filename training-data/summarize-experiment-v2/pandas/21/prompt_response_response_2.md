The potential error in the buggy function is the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically the list indexer. This inconsistency is leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions in some cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different types of indexers needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function with the necessary fixes:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, str):  # Ensure key is a string
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the handling of the key input has been modified to ensure that it is consistently treated as a string, which should address the inconsistency in behavior across different types of indexers.

By making these changes, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
