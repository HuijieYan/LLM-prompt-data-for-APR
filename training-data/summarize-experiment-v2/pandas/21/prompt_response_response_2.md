The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the file `pandas/core/series.py`. The function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

Based on the failing test and the error message it's clear that the issue arises when trying to access a `Series` using a list indexer. The behavior is inconsistent as accessing the `Series` using other array-like indexers such as `np.array` or `pd.Index` doesn't raise an error, but using a list indexer does.

The expected behavior is for the function to handle list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers, which means it should not raise a KeyError. The behavior for `ser.loc[key]` should also be consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way it handles other array-like indexers. It should not raise a KeyError for list indexers and it should ensure that the behavior is consistent with `ser.loc[key]` for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers, and the behavior should be consistent with `ser.loc[key]` for all types of indexers.

This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
