The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing the KeyError in the failing test case.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the issue arises when dealing with different types of indexers, leading to an incorrect determination of the `key_type`. This incorrect `key_type` then affects the indexing approach in the subsequent code.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent treatment of different types of indexers and determine the `key_type` accurately. We should also handle the list indexers in a manner similar to other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we ensure consistent treatment of different indexers by converting `key` to an index using `ensure_index`. We then accurately determine the `key_type` and handle list indexers in a manner similar to other array-like indexers.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
