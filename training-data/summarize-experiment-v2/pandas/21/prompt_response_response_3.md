Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'key' input parameter and the conditional checks for different types of 'key'.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly identifying and handling single string inputs due to the mismatch in the input type for the 'key' parameter.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to enforce the correct type for the 'key' parameter and correctly identify and handle single string inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series)):
        key = pd.Index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The above corrected code enforces the correct type for the 'key' parameter and ensures that single string inputs are correctly identified and handled. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue stated in the GitHub post.

Additionally, the correction in the code should align with the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully address the bug identified.
