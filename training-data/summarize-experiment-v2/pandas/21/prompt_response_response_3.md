The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for determining the `key_type`, which is currently not working correctly and consistently inferring the key type as 'string'.

The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` function is not accurately determining the type of the input key, which results in incorrect behavior when handling different types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing the failing test to raise a KeyError for list indexers, while it works as expected for array-like indexers. 

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially updated to correctly identify the type of the input key. This could involve checking the type of the key using appropriate methods for different input types such as lists, ndarrays, DataFrames, etc., and then setting the `key_type` accordingly. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle Index objects differently in order to correctly infer the type of the key.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_list_like(key):
            key_type = "list-like"
        elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key_type = "ndarray"
        elif isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
            key_type = "extension_array"
        elif isinstance(key, Series):
            key_type = "series"
        elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            key_type = "dataframe"
        elif is_scalar(key):
            key_type = "scalar"
        # Additional checks for other types if necessary

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "list-like":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `key_type` is accurately determined based on the type of the input key, and then takes different actions based on the type, ensuring consistent and expected behavior for all input cases. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
