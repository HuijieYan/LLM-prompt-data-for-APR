The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. Based on the failing test and input/output variable information, we can identify the potential error location within the function:

The issue arises when processing list indexers in the `_get_with` function and results in a KeyError. The function does not handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected function for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function will handle list indexers in a manner consistent with array-like indexers to ensure uniform behavior. The fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and resolve the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue.
