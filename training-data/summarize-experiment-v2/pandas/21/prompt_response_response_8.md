The issue is with the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, it is not being handled correctly and is raising a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This block is supposed to handle scalar values or other non-list-like indexers, but it is incorrectly handling list indexers as well.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the mishandling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function should handle list indexers differently from other types of indexers, but the current implementation is inconsistent.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers needs to be adjusted in the `_get_with` function. The function should correctly handle list indexers and avoid raising a KeyError when a list indexer is passed.

Here's a possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `key` is a list or ndarray. If it is, return the result of `self.loc[key]`.
2. If the `key` is not a list or ndarray, continue with the existing handling for other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # ... (existing code for handling slices)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        # ... (existing code for handling DataFrame indexers)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # ... (existing code for handling tuple indexers)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # ... (existing code for handling other types of indexers)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers correctly and pass the failing test. It also addresses the inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's description, where the behavior of list indexers is highlighted as inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.

The corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub, and the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.
