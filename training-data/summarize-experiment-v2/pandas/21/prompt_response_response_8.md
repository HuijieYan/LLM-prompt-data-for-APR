Based on the analysis, the potential error in the buggy function lies in the inconsistent handling of the 'key' input parameter. The function is not correctly identifying and handling single string inputs in all cases. This inconsistency is leading to the failure of the test cases and the discrepancy between the actual and expected input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure consistent identification and handling of the 'key' input as a single string. This can be achieved by making appropriate changes to the input handling logic of the function to enforce the correct type for the 'key' parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Index, Series)):
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):
            return self.loc[key[0]]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the 'key' input is consistently identified and handled as a single string. The function now checks if the input is an array-like object with a single string element, and if so, utilizes the 'loc' indexer to retrieve the value. For other cases, it falls back to reindexing the data.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
