The issue appears to be with how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches()` attempts to access an element 'C' from the Pandas series `ser` using different types of indexers. The error message indicates that the `ser[list(key)]` call is not behaving as expected, leading to a KeyError.

Upon inspection, it seems that the `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'` in all cases, which suggests that the list indexers are not being handled properly.

To address this issue, we can modify the `key_type` determination section in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we have explicitly handled list indexers along with other array-like indexers, ensuring that they are treated consistently in determining the `key_type`.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should be able to handle the different types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches()`. Additionally, it should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue related to list indexers.
