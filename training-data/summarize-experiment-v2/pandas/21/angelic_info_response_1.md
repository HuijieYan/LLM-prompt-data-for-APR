In this case, it seems that the function is intended to determine the type of the key and then take different actions based on the type. However, the condition for checking the type of the key seems to be incorrect, resulting in the function not behaving as expected.

In all cases, the key_type should be determined based on the type of the key being passed to the function. If the key is a string, the key_type should be set to 'string'.

A corrected function should have the condition for determining the key_type accurately to ensure that the function behaves as intended for all input cases.
