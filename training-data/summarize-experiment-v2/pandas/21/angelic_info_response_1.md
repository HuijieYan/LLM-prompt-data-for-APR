The reason for the discrepancy in all the failing test cases seems to be the function's inability to correctly identify the type of the key input. In all cases, the key input is a single string value being passed to a function that is designed to handle single string inputs. However, the function is failing to recognize the input as a string.

The expected value and type of the key_type variable right before the function's return is 'string' and type str for all cases, but the function is not producing this expected output.

Therefore, the core logic of the function needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to correctly identify and handle single string inputs.
