Summary:
Based on the runtime input/output values and the type of variables inside the buggy function, the discrepancy in the test cases seems to be caused by the handling of the 'key' input parameter. The input key is expected to be a string, but in some cases it is being passed as a list, ndarray, or Series. This mismatch in the input type is causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the 'key' input parameter is consistently passed as a string type. This can be achieved by making appropriate changes to the input handling logic of the function to enforce the correct type for the 'key' parameter.
