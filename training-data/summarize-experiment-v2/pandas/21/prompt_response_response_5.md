Based on the failing tests and the provided code, the likely cause of the issue is that the function is not handling the `list` type of indexer correctly. The code seems inconsistent in its handling of different types of indexers. This inconsistency has led to a failing test `test_getitem_no_matches()` which expects consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the `list` type of indexers in a similar way to how it handles other indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function handles the `list` type of indexers in a similar manner to how it handles other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. Additionally, it aligns with the expected input/output variable information and addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
