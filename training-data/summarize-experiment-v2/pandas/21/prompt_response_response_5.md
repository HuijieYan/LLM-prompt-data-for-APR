Upon analysis of the given information, it appears that the bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the way different types of indexers are handled. The issue seems to arise when a list type indexer is used, which is not being handled correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The expected behavior is for all types of indexers (array-like, Index, and Series) to behave similarly, and only the list type indexer is causing the problem. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the list type indexer, specifically the block of code that processes the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.

To fix this bug, the handling of the list type indexer should be modified to match the behavior of other types of indexers, such as array-like, Index, and Series. This change will ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all types of indexers uniformly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should ensure that different types of indexers, including lists, are handled uniformly, and the KeyError issue should be resolved. The code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it will address the GitHub issue by ensuring consistent behavior across all types of indexers.
