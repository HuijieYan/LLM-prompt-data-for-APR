From the provided information this is what we can analyze:
- The failing test affects the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file.
- The failing test provides a Key Error which throws at the indexing property of the Series.
- The content `None of \[Index\(\['C'\], dtype='object'\)\] are in the \[index\]` is relevant to the fault location.

Simplified Error Message:
```
Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>
```

We can sense that `key = box(key)` is causing a problem.
