In this case, given the original error message, it seems like the failing Python test case is attempting to check if a certain error message is raised when an incorrect key is used for Series getitem.

The failing test case itself is from the file "test_getitem.py" within the "test_getitem_no_matches" function. The test is aiming to ensure that if a non-existent key is used in the getitem operation for a Series object, the error message indicates that none of the items in the index match.

The error message that is expected to be raised is related to the KeyError. However, the error message "DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>" which states that the key error was not raised.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the expected error message to be raised is "KeyError" if the failing condition is met, but the test is showing that the expected error message was not actually raised as per the expectation.
