The failure occurs in the `test_getitem_no_matches()` function of file pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py.

The test code attempts to get an element 'C' from the Pandas series `ser`. The method triggers a KeyError. 

The `test_getitem_no_matches()` function loads the Pandas series with elements 'A' and 'B', and then attempts to access an element 'C'.

Here is a simplified error message:
- "KeyError raised during 'ser[key]'"

It is evident that the failing assertion occurs in the `ser[key]` call.
