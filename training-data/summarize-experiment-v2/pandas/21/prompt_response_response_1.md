### Bug Cause Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, etc., but it is not behaving consistently. This is evident from the failing test, which tests the behavior of the function with different types of indexers.

The failing test is checking the behavior of the function with a key of type `list`, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but the function does not raise the `KeyError` in this case.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we see that the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` for all cases. This is not consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

The GitHub issue title and description highlight the inconsistency in the behavior of the function when it comes to list indexers versus other array-like indexers. The failing test is a clear demonstration of this inconsistency.

### Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

One approach could be to modify the logic for handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, the function should correctly infer the type of the indexer and handle it appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # existing logic for other types of indexers
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case where the key is a list by using `self.loc[key]`, which is consistent with how other array-like indexers are handled. This modification should address the inconsistency highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue. After making this change, the function should pass the failing test and behave consistently for different types of indexers.
