The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case of list-like indexers correctly, leading to inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to the failing test in the `test_getitem_no_matches` function.

The potential error in the function is the handling of list-like indexers. The function is not treating list-like indexers (e.g., `key`) consistently with other array-like indexers (e.g., `np.array(key)`, `pd.Index(key)`).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, so that the behavior remains consistent across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index) or is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we handle list-like indexers (including `pd.Index` and other list-like objects) in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior remains consistent across different types of indexers.

This should resolve the inconsistency issue and make the function behave as expected for different types of indexers, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information. This will also address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
