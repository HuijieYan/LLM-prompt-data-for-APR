The potential error in the buggy function was the incorrect handling of different key types, which resulted in the `key_type` consistently being inferred as `'string'` regardless of the actual input key type.

The correction involves accurately determining the type of the input key and setting the `key_type` accordingly based on the input type. Additionally, the code is updated to handle Index objects differently to correctly infer the type of the key.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now behave as expected for all input cases.

The corrected code provided satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by ensuring consistent behavior for indexers in a series index.
