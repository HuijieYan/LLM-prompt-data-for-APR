The issue lies in the conditional logic within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the check for whether the `key` is array-like or a list is not being handled correctly.

Looking at the GitHub issue, it seems that when a list is used as the key to access elements from the Series, an inconsistent behavior is observed compared to when other array-like objects are used. The actual error occurs in the `_validate_read_indexer` function, which is triggered by the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function.

To fix the issue, we need to update the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that the behavior is consistent for array-like objects and lists.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and key and not is_bool(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version handles both array-like objects and lists in a consistent manner.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
