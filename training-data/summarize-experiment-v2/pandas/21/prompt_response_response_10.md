The bug seems to be in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, as indicated by the failing test and the error message. The failing test is asserting that when accessing a `Series` with a list indexer, a KeyError should be raised, but the actual behavior is different. It seems that the function is not handling list indexers correctly.

The `_get_with` function checks the type of the `key` parameter and branches into different behavior based on the type. For list-like types, it should raise a KeyError, but it seems that this logic is not working correctly.

The expected behavior for list-like indexers should be consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers like NumPy arrays or Pandas Index objects. The failing test demonstrates that the behavior for list-like indexers is inconsistent with these other array-like indexers.

The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers. It seems that the behavior for list indexers should be made consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers to ensure uniformity and to avoid confusion.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function needs to be revised. It should be updated to raise a KeyError for list-like indexers, consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers correctly, raising a KeyError in line with the expected behavior. This should resolve the inconsistency and satisfy the failing test and the GitHub issue.
