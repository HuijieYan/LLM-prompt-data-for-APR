The issue in the buggy function "_get_with" seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the 'key' input parameter. The function is expecting a string input for the 'key', but it is being passed as list, ndarray, or Series in some cases, causing the function to fail. To fix this bug, the input handling logic of the function needs to be modified to enforce the correct type for the 'key' parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function "_get_with":

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, str):
        key = str(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that the 'key' input is always converted to a string type before further processing. This will enforce consistency in the type of the 'key' input and prevent the function from failing due to discrepancies in input type.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
