The issue seems to be related to how the buggy function handles different types of indexers. When an indexer is provided as a list, the function raises a KeyError, while it behaves differently when the indexer is an array-like index or a pandas Index. This behavior is inconsistent and causes the failing test.

The bug is likely located in the conditional statements that handle different types of key inputs. The conditional statement for list-like keys seems to be causing the issue as it does not handle the case appropriately.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for list-like keys should be modified to match the behavior of other types of indexers. This modification should ensure that the function behaves consistently regardless of the type of indexer provided.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle all types of indexers in the same way
        return self.reindex(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this modification, the function should handle all types of indexers in the same way, which should resolve the inconsistency and make the failing test pass.

Once the bug is fixed, the corrected function should behave as expected in all the provided test cases, producing the expected output for each case. It should also satisfy the input/output variable information outlined in the expected values.

Finally, the fix should be validated by running the failing test to ensure that it passes, and the behavior of the function matches the expected outcome. If the fix also addresses the concerns raised in the GitHub issue, it can be submitted as a resolution to the issue.
