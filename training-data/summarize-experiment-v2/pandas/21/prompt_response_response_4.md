Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue seems to stem from the handling of the 'key' input parameter, which is expected to be a string but is being passed as a list, ndarray, or Series in some cases. This inconsistency is causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, the input handling logic of the function should be modified to ensure that the 'key' input parameter is consistently treated as a string type. This can be achieved by enforcing the correct type for the 'key' parameter.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to explicitly handle the 'key' input parameter as a string and convert it to a string if it is not already in that format.
2. Refactor the function to handle different input types for the 'key' parameter in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = str(key)  # Ensure key is treated as a string

    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

The modified code explicitly converts the 'key' input parameter to a string using the `str()` function and checks if the string key exists in the index. If not, it raises a KeyError with the appropriate message. This approach ensures that the function consistently handles the 'key' input parameter as a string type.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistencies in the handling of different input types for the 'key' parameter.
