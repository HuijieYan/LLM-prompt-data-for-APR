The issue lies in the section of the code where the input parameter "key" is being identified and processed. It seems that the indexing behavior for list indexers is different from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency and triggering a KeyError in the case of a list key.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the list key when it tries to locate the index values. This leads to the KeyError being raised instead of properly processing the index.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to properly handle the list key in the same way as other array-like indexers, thus ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = 'string'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code should now handle the list key in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and addressing the KeyError issue. It should pass the failing test cases and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub Issue.
