The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks whether the 'key' is a column name or part of the index. This is where the KeyError is likely occurring.

The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly interpreting the expected grouping key 'x' as a column name when it is actually part of the index. This leads to a key error when attempting to access the group information.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately distinguish between column names and index labels when processing the 'key' parameter. It should also handle MultiIndex columns correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement a check to distinguish between column names and index labels when processing the 'key' parameter.
2. If the 'key' is part of the index, the function should access the group information accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # Validate if the key is a column or part of the index
    if key in obj.columns:
        group_axis = obj[key]
    elif key in obj.index:
        group_axis = obj.loc[:, key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

    # continue with the rest of the code...
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'key' is present in the DataFrame columns. If it is, we use it as part of the group_axis. If not, we then check if it is part of the index, and if so, we access it using the 'loc' indexer. If neither condition is met, we raise a KeyError.

This corrected code should accurately handle cases where the 'key' is a column name or part of the index, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
