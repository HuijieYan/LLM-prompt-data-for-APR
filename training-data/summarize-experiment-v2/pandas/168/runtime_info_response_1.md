After analyzing each runtime input/output values and type of variables for each test case, it seems that the core logic of the function is not able to handle the multi-index DataFrame properly. It appears that the group_axis is being incorrectly derived as the Int64Index instead of as the MultiIndex due to the presence of multi-index columns.

The discrepancy in the test cases occur due to the conversion problem from multi-index to single-index when extracting group_axis. The code logic is not correctly identifying the presence of multi-index columns and is causing the discrepancy in the results.

To fix the bug, the code logic needs to be modified to properly handle multi-index columns and accurately extract group_axis as MultiIndex instead of Int64Index. This will ensure that the function can handle both single-index and multi-index DataFrames correctly.
