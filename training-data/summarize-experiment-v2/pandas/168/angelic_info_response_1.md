Summarizing the analysis of the failing test cases, it appears that the function is not handling certain input parameters and data structures correctly, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual outcomes. The inputs such as DataFrame, axis, key, and other attributes are being correctly passed to the function but the core logic of the function is not aligning with the expected outputs.

In both test cases, the function is not producing the expected output for variables such as group_axis, is_tuple, all_hashable, keys, match_axis_length, any_callable, any_groupers, any_arraylike, levels, groupings, exclusions, gpr, and i. This indicates that there are issues with how the function is processing and manipulating the input data, which leads to incorrect outputs.

To resolve the discrepancies, the core logic of the function needs to be revised to ensure that it appropriately handles the input parameters and data structures, leading to the correct output values for the mentioned variables.
