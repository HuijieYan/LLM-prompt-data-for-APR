The first expected case indicates that there are several variables, such as `group_axis`, `is_tuple`, `all_hashable`, `keys`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike`, `levels`, `groupings`, `exclusions`, `gpr`, and `i` that need to be properly initialized, processed, and validated based on the given input parameters. The expected values and types of these variables are provided, indicating what they should be at the time of the buggy function's return.

The second expected case is similar, although the input parameter `key` is now a list containing the string `'x'`. The expected values and types of the same variables are provided based on this change to the input parameters.
