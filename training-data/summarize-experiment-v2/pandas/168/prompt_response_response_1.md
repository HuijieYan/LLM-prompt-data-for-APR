The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is likely to be caused by the inconsistency in handling grouping by columns when a single column label is passed. The error message indicates a KeyError when attempting to group by a specific value 'x'. This suggests that there is an issue handling single column labels as group keys.

To resolve the bug:
1. We need to modify the way single column labels are handled when grouping along columns. This likely involves a revision in the conditional checks and handling for single column labels.
2. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function can handle MultiIndex columns properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Revision in handling the single column label
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level and level in obj.columns:
                    key = obj[level]
                    level = None
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Remaining code in the function remains unchanged

    # ...
    # (Remaining code from the original function)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With the provided correction, the function should now be able to handle grouping by single column labels as well as MultiIndex columns properly.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and address the issue reported in the GitHub issue related to the KeyError when attempting to group by a specific column label 'x'.
