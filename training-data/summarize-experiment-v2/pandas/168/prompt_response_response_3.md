Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to interpret the expected grouping key 'x' as a column name when it is actually part of the index. This leads to a key error when attempting to access the group information.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly interprets the 'x' key as a column name when it is actually an index name, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code to correctly handle the key 'x' in the case where it is part of the index, not the columns.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Check the type of the key being passed in and handle it appropriately based on whether it's a column name or an index name.
- Ensure that the function correctly interprets the 'x' key as an index name when it is part of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # existing code

    # check if 'key' is in obj.columns or obj.index.names
    if key in obj.columns or key in obj.index.names:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1 - axis)  # Use the axis opposite to 'axis' for grouping

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code should properly handle the situation where the key 'x' is actually part of the index, and it should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
