The buggy function appears to be causing a KeyError when attempting to group the DataFrame by a specific column or index level. The incorrect handling of input parameters, particularly when dealing with MultiIndex, may be leading to this issue.

To resolve this bug, we can update the _get_grouper function to correctly handle the groupby operation when using column names or index levels. This can be achieved by ensuring the input parameters are appropriately processed and validated before initiating the groupby operation.

Possible approaches to fix this bug include:
1. Ensuring that the groupby operation correctly handles both column names and index levels, especially in cases involving MultiIndex data.
2. Validating the input parameters to prevent KeyError during the groupby operation.
3. Testing the modified _get_grouper function with various input scenarios, particularly involving different types of indices and columns.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # updated condition to handle MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                # validate the level name against the index
                if obj.index.name != level and level not in obj.index.names:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not a valid index level".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # remaining code...

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the condition for handling MultiIndex and validating the level name against the index, the corrected version of the _get_grouper function should address the KeyError issue and correctly handle groupby operations on columns and index levels.

Once the corrected function is integrated, it should be tested with the failing test to ensure it passes and resolves the issue as reported in the GitHub problem description.
