Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to stem from the handling of grouping by columns, specifically with the key "x". The code attempts to interpret the key "x" as a column name, but encounters a KeyError as "x" is part of the index, not a column name.

Bug cause:
The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect interpretation of the key "x" as a column name, which leads to a KeyError when attempting to access the group information.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling the key "x" to correctly identify it as part of the index, not a column name.
2. Add a condition to check if the key is a column name or part of the index and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (other comments remain the same)

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """

    # Check if key is a valid column name
    if key in obj.columns:
        # Group by column name
        group_axis = obj[key]
    else:
        # Group by index level
        group_axis = obj.index

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the grouping by columns, and the KeyError issue should be resolved. This updated logic will ensure that the key "x" is correctly interpreted based on whether it is a valid column name or part of the index.
