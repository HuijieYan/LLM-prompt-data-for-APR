In the failing test, there is a KeyError raised at line 615 in the 'grouper.py' file. The stack trace shows that the error was initiated in the 'test_groupby_axis_1' function of the 'test_groupby.py' file, when calling the groupby method on a DataFrame.

The simplified error message is:

```
KeyError: 'x'
```
