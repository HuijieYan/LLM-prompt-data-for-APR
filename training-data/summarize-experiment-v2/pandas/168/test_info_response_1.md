The error comes from the groupby method in the pandas library. The input 'group_name' is used as the argument for groupby, and this causes an error when attempting to group by 'x'. The error message indicates that the KeyError 'x' occurs on line 615 of the grouper.py file.

The failing test code tries to group a DataFrame by the column 'x', and it also attempts this with a MultiIndex (MI) column.

To simplify the error message:
- The error originates from an attempt to group the DataFrame by a specific column or index level.
- The error is caused by a KeyError when trying to group by the specific value 'x'.
- The error occurs in the grouper.py file, specifically at line 615.

In order to resolve this, it is necessary to check why a KeyError is occurring when trying to group the DataFrame by 'x'. This might involve debugging the implementation details of the groupby method in pandas/core/generic.py and pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py.
