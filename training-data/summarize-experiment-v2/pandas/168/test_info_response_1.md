The error message indicates that a `KeyError` occurred in the file `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` at line 615. This error was raised while trying to group by the key `x`. Looking further into the code and the error stack trace, it seems the failure point is due to an issue with interpreting the expected grouping key `x` as a column name when it is actually part of the index. This leads to a key error when attempting to access the group information.

Simplified Error Message:
```
KeyError: 'x' 
```
