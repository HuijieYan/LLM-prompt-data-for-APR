The potential error location within the problematic function is likely around the area where it attempts to interpret the grouping key as a column name when it is actually part of the index. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access the group information.

The bug's cause is as follows:
- The function is attempting to group by column name 'x' using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`, but 'x' is actually a column label.
- This leads to a KeyError as the function tries to access the group information using 'x' as a column name, which it is not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking if the input key is a column name or a column label and handling the grouping accordingly.
- Ensuring that the function correctly interprets the grouping key as either a column name or a column label based on the input.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing implementation ...

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        # group by column name
        group_axis = obj[key]
    else:
        group_axis = obj.index

    # ... rest of the function ...
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check if the axis is 1 and the key is a string present in the columns. If so, we group by the column name. Otherwise, we default to grouping by the index.

This correction ensures that the function correctly interprets the grouping key and avoids the KeyError that was previously occurring.
