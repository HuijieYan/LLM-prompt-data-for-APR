Based on the analysis of the provided information, including the buggy function, related class, test code, error message, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the incorrect calculation and handling of bin edges and labels in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect conversion of hourly frequency to daily frequency, as well as the incorrect adjustments for the time zone, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure correct conversion of hourly frequency to daily frequency while accounting for the time zone.
2. Implement appropriate adjustments for handling ambiguous timestamps, particularly on a clock change day.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method within the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other class and function declarations here)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            closed=self.closed,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version ensures appropriate handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps during the calculation of bin edges and labels, addressing the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days. This version of the method should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
