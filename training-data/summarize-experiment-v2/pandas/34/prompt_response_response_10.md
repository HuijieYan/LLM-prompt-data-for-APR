Unfortunately, since the actual body of the functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges` are not provided, it is challenging to identify the exact root cause of the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function.

However, based on the error message and the failing test case, it seems that the bug might be related to handling ambiguous timestamps resulting from a clock change day. This suggests that the issue could be related to the handling of timezone adjustments in the calculation of the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` variables.

To fix the bug, possible approaches might include:
1. Reviewing the logic in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function to ensure it correctly adjusts the bin edges based on the input values of `binner` and `ax_values`.
2. Verifying that the `generate_bins_dt64` function is handling the adjusted bin edges correctly to generate the `bins` array accurately.
3. Handling ambiguous timestamps or non-existing times during the creation of `binner` and `bin_edges`.

Assuming the above approaches address the bug, here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function taking into consideration the potential approaches and the fix for the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = _adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)  # updated to use correct function

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
