The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function, which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas.core.resample` module. The function checks if the input parameter `ax` is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`, and if not, it raises a TypeError. The error message indicates that the issue is related to time bins.

Based on the input parameters and the variables right before the return statement, it seems that the function is creating time bins and labels based on the frequency and the range of the input `ax`. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the time change in Cuba correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The failing test case further emphasizes the issue with time intervals, as it tests a scenario involving time changes in a specific timezone.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem and the expected behavior. It mentions that the issue is similar to a previously fixed one, but it still persists in the current version of pandas (0.24.2).

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to address the handling of ambiguous times, especially in cases involving time changes in specific timezones.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to update the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times, particularly in scenarios where there are time changes in specific timezones.

Here's a potential correction for the problematic function:

```python
# updated and corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # handle ambiguous times
    binner = binner.tz_localize(None)
    labels = labels.tz_localize(None)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated function handles ambiguous times by utilizing the `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` options in the `date_range` function. Additionally, it localizes the time bins and labels to handle the ambiguity in time changes in specific timezones.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and would resolve the failing test case related to time intervals.
