The bug seems to be related to the calculation and handling of the bin edges and labels. Based on the provided test case, the input parameter `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` with hourly frequency and a time zone of America/Havana. The `self.freq` parameter is set to `<Day>` and `self.closed` is set to `'left'`. The `binner` and `labels` variables, which are the values right before the function's return, are also `DatetimeIndex` objects with certain date values and the same time zone. Additionally, `bin_edges` and `bins` are ndarrays with some specific values.

The bug likely originates from the incorrect calculation of the bin edges and labels. Since the frequency `self.freq` is set to `<Day>`, the bin edges and labels should correspond to day-wise intervals in the provided time zone. However, based on the provided runtime values, it seems that these calculations are not being performed correctly, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual bin edges and labels.

To fix this bug, the function should be analyzed to ensure that the frequency and time zone are appropriately accounted for in the calculation of bin edges and labels. Specifically, the code handling the conversion of hourly frequency to daily frequency and adjustments for the time zone should be reviewed to identify and rectify the issue.
