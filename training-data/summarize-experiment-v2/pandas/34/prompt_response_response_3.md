The potential error location within the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is likely related to the handling of daylight saving time (DST) in the `date_range` function call, especially when dealing with the transition of DST in Cuba.

The bug's cause is related to the failure to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly due to the transition in DST. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling the `groupby` function. The issue is that the `date_range` function is not handling the DST transition in Cuba correctly, leading to ambiguous timestamps and subsequent errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function is capable of handling the transition in DST correctly, and that it creates non-ambiguous timestamps for the specified frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Get the start and end timestamps
    start_ts = Timestamp(ax.min()).floor(self.base)
    end_ts = Timestamp(ax.max()).ceil(self.base) if self.closed == 'right' else Timestamp(ax.max()).floor(self.base)

    binner = date_range(start=start_ts, end=end_ts, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels.shift(1)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By modifying the handling of start and end timestamps, as well as using the `shift` function to adjust the labels, this corrected code should resolve the issue with the `AmbiguousTimeError` and handle the DST transition correctly.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class. This fix should also pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
