### Identification of Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is in the type checking of the `ax` variable. This function expects the `ax` variable to be of type `DatetimeIndex`, but it is raising a TypeError if it's not. This suggests that the function might be receiving an instance of a different type instead of a `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused by the handling of ambiguous time during the time interval grouping. The time bins are not being properly adjusted to handle the ambiguous timestamps, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` on the clock change day in Cuba.

The failing test provided also indicates that the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00', which is the first midnight before the clock change. This suggests that the issue is related to the handling of ambiguous time on that date.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous time during time interval grouping, specifically on the clock change day in Cuba.
2. Check for instances of ambiguous time and handle them appropriately, ensuring that the grouping is done correctly without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time during time interval grouping
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Ensure normalization for ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, we have added a section to handle ambiguous time during time interval grouping within the `_get_time_bins` function. We utilize `normalize=True` in the `date_range` function to ensure normalization for ambiguous times. This should address the AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba.
