Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring in the section of code where the time bins are being generated, specifically in the part where the time bins are adjusted to handle nanosecond precision and closed intervals. 

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time stamps, particularly on a clock-change day in Cuba. The code does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an error. The issue is highlighted in the GitHub report, and the error message also points to a problem with the datetime index checks.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to handle ambiguous time stamps correctly, possibly by using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in the `date_range` function to account for ambiguous and non-existent times during the clock change.
2. Include additional checks for ambiguous times and adjust the time bins accordingly to avoid errors related to ambiguous timestamps.

Here's a possible fix for the problematic function, which takes into account handling of ambiguous time stamps:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Adjust for ambiguous and non-existent times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated function should handle ambiguous time stamps correctly and resolve the error reported in the GitHub issue.
