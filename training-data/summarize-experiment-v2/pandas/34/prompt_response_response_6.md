### Analysis

The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins for resampling, and the error message indicates that there is an issue with checking if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex`. This error occurs specifically on days with a clock change, such as in the failing test case.

The failing test case attempts to downsample a time series with a daily frequency, and the expected output dates back to the clock change day in Cuba.

The variables involved in the buggy function seem to be appropriately handled, and the bug is likely related to the handling of time zones and ambiguous time on clock change days.

The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the specific scenario in which the bug occurs and the expected behavior.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the handling of time zones and ambiguous time on clock change days, specifically within the validation of `ax` as a `DatetimeIndex` and the creation of time bins.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of time zones and ambiguous time during the creation of time bins for resampling, causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure proper handling of time zones and ambiguous time during the creation of time bins.
2. Validate the `DatetimeIndex` input `ax` to account for ambiguous time on clock change days.
3. Adjust the creation of time bins to handle the specific scenario of ambiguous time due to a clock change.

### Corrected Code
Here's a suggested correction for the `_get_time_bins` function to address the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code accounts for ambiguous time on clock change days and handles time zones properly during the creation of time bins. This should address the specific scenario described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
