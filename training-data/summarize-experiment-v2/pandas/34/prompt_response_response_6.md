The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change in Cuba. This issue causes the AmbiguousTimeError when using the `groupby` function on a long clock-change day.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function `_get_time_bins` handles the time bins and labels, especially around the time change.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include addressing the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function and accounting for the time zone changes during the daylight saving time shift.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use date_range with ambiguous='NaT' to handle ambiguous time during daylight saving time change
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='NaT',
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Other code remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code uses the `ambiguous='NaT'` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. This code should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue.
