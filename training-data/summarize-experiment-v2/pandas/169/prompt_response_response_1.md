## Issue Analysis
The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` that occurred when using the `quantile` method on a DataFrame with datetime data. This error occurs during the concatenation of arrays, which suggests that the issue may be related to the handling of datetime data in the quantile method.

Analyzing the input parameters and the variables within the function reveals that the `data` being operated on is an empty DataFrame after transposition, and the data types are not being handled correctly. This causes issues with concatenation, leading to the ValueError.

The GitHub issue details this problem and provides an example where the `pd.Series` works correctly, but the equivalent method with a DataFrame raises a ValueError. The expected output is that the DataFrame should return just as Series does.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of datetime data in the `quantile` function of the DataFrame class. When operating with datetime data, transposing the DataFrame and performing operations on it leads to an empty DataFrame, causing issues with concatenation and resulting in a ValueError.

## Possible Approaches
1. Update the handling of datetime data to ensure that the quantile method can correctly operate on datetime values.
2. Validate the transposition and ensure that it is not causing the DataFrame to become empty when dealing with datetime data.
3. Check the concatenation processes and ensure they are handling datetime data correctly.

## Corrected Code
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    Updated to handle datetime data correctly.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        # Don't transpose datetime data
        data = data.T if data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64']).empty else data

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed and not data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64']).empty:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code introduces a check to handle datetime data differently when transposing the DataFrame in the quantile function. This ensures that datetime data is not mistakenly transposed, leading to an empty DataFrame. With this correction, the quantile method should handle datetime data correctly and avoid the ValueError.
