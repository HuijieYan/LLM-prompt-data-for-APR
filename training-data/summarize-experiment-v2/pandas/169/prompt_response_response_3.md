## Bug Location

The bug is likely located within the `quantile` function, specifically at the line:
```python
result = data._data.quantile(
    qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
)
```
This is where the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` is triggered, indicating an issue with concatenation of arrays.

## Bug Cause

The `quantile` function is not handling the specific case of datetime data correctly, which is causing the issue. It seems that the function is trying to perform a concatenation operation on empty data or unrecognized data type, leading to a `ValueError` when `numeric_only` is set to `False`.

## Possible Approaches

1. Check the data type and handle datetime data appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function handles empty or unrecognized data types gracefully.
3. Add a condition to verify the data type and proceed accordingly.

## Suggested Code Fix

Here's a potential fix for the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not numeric_only:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:  # Handle empty data
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            result = pd.Series([], index=[], name=q)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This fix includes a condition to handle empty or unrecognized data types, and also to properly process the input `q` when it's a list.

With this fix, the `quantile` function should handle datetime data and empty data gracefully, and the failing test case should be resolved.

Please test this fix with the failing test case to confirm that it resolves the issue.
