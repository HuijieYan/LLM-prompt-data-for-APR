The issue seems to be related to the handling of datetime data in the `DataFrame.quantile` method. The failing tests and the error message indicate that the concatenation of arrays is failing, which is likely due to the specific handling of datetime data.

The `quantile` method itself seems to incorrectly handle the datetime data, leading to issues within the `core/dtypes/concat.py` file. The `_constructor` and `quantile` methods within the `DataFrame` class might also be related to the issue, as they could be affecting the data transformation.

The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" suggests that there might be an issue with the conversion or concatenation of data when dealing with datetime values.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to modify the data processing within the `quantile` method to properly handle datetime data. Additionally, the `_constructor` and `quantile` methods might need to be reviewed to ensure they are compatible with datetime data.

Here's a possible correction to the problematic function, taking into account the handling of datetime data:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handle datetime data separately
    if data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64']).empty:
        # No datetime data, proceed with regular quantile computation
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    else:
        # Handle datetime data separately
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=1)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code includes a check for datetime data and handles it separately, ensuring that the quantile computation for datetime values is done correctly.

By integrating this corrected code into the `quantile` method, the issue with datetime data causing concatenation errors should be resolved. This code should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to the incorrect behavior when calculating quantiles for datetime data.
