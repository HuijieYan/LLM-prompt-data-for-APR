Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the part responsible for populating the 'data' variable. 

The cause of the bug appears to be related to how the function is handling datetime data, which results in the ValueError indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic for handling datetime data within the quantile function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    # Other class methods and attributes are not included for brevity

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        # Update the logic for handling datetime and timedelta data
        if data._is_mixed_type:
            data = data.select_dtypes([np.number])

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

By updating the logic for handling datetime and timedelta data within the quantile function, the corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

Please note that the actual bug fix might require more detailed investigation into the pandas library and the interaction between different data types within the quantile function. However, the provided corrected code should address the main issue related to handling datetime data.
