The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the `_get_numeric_data()` method, which is used to filter the numeric data in the input dataframe. This method is not functioning as intended, resulting in empty dataframes and incorrect quantile calculations.

To fix the bug, the `_get_numeric_data()` method should be reviewed and potentially debugged to ensure it correctly identifies and filters the numeric data within the input dataframe. Once this issue is resolved, the `quantile` function should be able to properly calculate the quantiles of the numeric data within the input dataframe.

To fix the bug, the corrected `quantile` function is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected function filters the numeric data using the `select_dtypes` method, which properly identifies the numeric data within the input dataframe. The `quantile` method is then applied to the filtered data, ensuring that the quantiles of the numeric data are correctly calculated.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
