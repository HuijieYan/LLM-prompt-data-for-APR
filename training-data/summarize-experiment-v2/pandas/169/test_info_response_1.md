The error seems to be related to concatenation within the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. The stack frames that are closely related to the fault location are in the `quantile` method of the `pandas/core/frame.py` file and in the `quantile` method of the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.

Simplified error message:
```
ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate
```
