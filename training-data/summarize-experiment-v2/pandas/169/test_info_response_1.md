The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` that occurred in the `concat_compat` function, located in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file. The error was originally triggered by a call to `df.quantile(0.5)` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` file. This indicates that the issue is related to concatenation of arrays, but the exact context within the code is not clear.

The error occurred during the execution of the `quantile` method, specifically at the line `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)` in the `quantile` function, as indicated by the stack trace.

Simplified error message:
```
