In both cases, the function `quantile` is not correctly processing the input data. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the numeric data within the input DataFrame, which leads to empty dataframes and incorrect results.

The issue likely lies in the `_get_numeric_data()` method, which is used to filter the numeric data in the input dataframe. This method is not functioning as intended, resulting in empty dataframes and incorrect quantile calculations.

To fix this, the `_get_numeric_data()` method should be reviewed and potentially debugged to ensure it correctly identifies and filters the numeric data within the input dataframe. Once this issue is resolved, the `quantile` function should be able to properly calculate the quantiles of the numeric data within the input dataframe.
