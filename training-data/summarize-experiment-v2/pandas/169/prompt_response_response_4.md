The problem in the `quantile` function is that it is not handling datetime data correctly. It's failing when trying to concatenate empty arrays, and it's not considering datetime and timedelta data properly when `numeric_only=False`.

To fix the issue, we need to handle datetime and timedelta data appropriately.

Here's the corrected `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number, np.datetime64, np.timedelta64])
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

The corrected function now handles datetime and timedelta data properly by using `select_dtypes` to include them when `numeric_only=False`. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
