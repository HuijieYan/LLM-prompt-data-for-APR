The original error message relates to a `Series` object that has no attribute 'columns' at line 6101 in the file `pandas/core/frame.py`, which was initiated by one of the calls to `pivot_table` in the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The error occurred while the `pivot_table` method was invoked in the `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` test method in `pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py`. The pivot table values are derived using the dataframe `df2` from this test file.

Simplified Error Message:
```
During the execution of the test_pivot_table_multiindex_only test in pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py, the pivot_table method encountered an error in the pivot.py file at line 173, and subsequently, the Series object called this method which resulted in an AttributeError.
