The error message is as follows:
`AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`

This occurs at two main points in the error messages. The first point is at `pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py` on line 953, which is the `result = df2.pivot_table(values="v", columns=cols)` line when evaluating a specific test. The other point is at `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` at line 173 related to the pivot_table function and the code snippet `and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)`.

The error message clearly indicates that the code is trying to access the `columns` attribute from a 'Series' object, which is not available. This helps in identifying the point of failure. It shows that the method `pivot_table` is assumed to be returning a 'DataFrame', but the resulting object is a 'Series' instead.

This kind of error occurs when the input or the pivot_table function is unable to generate the expected output. The error should be traced back to identifying issues in the pivot_table function.

Upon simplification, the error message is: `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`.
