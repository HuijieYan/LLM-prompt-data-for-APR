- The error message is an AttributeError that occurs on line 173 of the pivot_table function in the pivot.py file. This function calls the pivot_table function recursively but fails to return a dynamically generated object.
- The failing test function calls the pivot_table function with different arguments (column pairs) and compares the result with an expected output.
- The failing test function generates a DataFrame based on the column pairs and attempts to pivot the data using the pivot_table method.
- The error message reports an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.

Simplified Error Message: "Series' object has no attribute 'columns'"
Given that the error message appears to be focused on an attribute error for a 'Series' object, it seems to be related to the recursive calls within the pivot_table function and the handling of data.
