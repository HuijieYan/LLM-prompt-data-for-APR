Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the `pivot_table` function is at the recursive call to `pivot_table` when `aggfunc` is a list. The returned result is not dynamically generated, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.

Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the recursive call to `pivot_table` when `aggfunc` is a list. The function fails to return a dynamically generated object, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the resulting Series object.

Proposed Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the recursive call to `pivot_table` to ensure that it returns a dynamically generated DataFrame.
2. Check the logic of the recursive call and ensure that the returned result is in the expected format, especially when `aggfunc` is a list.

Additionally, the handling of multi-index columns needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure symmetrical behavior between rows/columns and single/multi cases.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...

    # Return the final table at the end of the function
    return table
```

In the corrected code, the approach to handling the recursive call with `aggfunc` as a list has been revised to ensure that it returns a dynamically generated DataFrame. This should resolve the AttributeError and align with the expected behavior, fixing the bug.
