Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring at this line in the buggy function:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```
The error message indicates that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This implies that the 'table' variable is a Series object when it should be a DataFrame.

Bug Cause:
The issue seems to be coming from the section of code where the pivot_table function is attempting to access the 'columns' attribute of the 'table' variable. This error occurs due to the way the function handles input for the 'columns' parameter. When the 'columns' parameter is set as a MultiIndex, the 'table' variable is a Series object instead of a DataFrame, causing the 'AttributeError'.

Suggested Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The pivot_table function should be modified to handle MultiIndex columns correctly. This could involve checking if the 'table' variable is a Series or a DataFrame before trying to access its 'columns' attribute.

Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the case where the 'table' is a Series by converting it to a DataFrame before accessing its 'columns' attribute.

Corrected Code for the Buggy Function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty:
        if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
            table = DataFrame(table)  # Convert to DataFrame if table is a Series
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # rest of the existing code...

    return table
```

The above correction includes a check to convert the 'table' variable to a DataFrame if it is a Series before attempting to access its 'columns' attribute. This correction should address the 'AttributeError' caused by accessing the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.
