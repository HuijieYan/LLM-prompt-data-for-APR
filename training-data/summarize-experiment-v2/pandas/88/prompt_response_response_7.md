The issue seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function encountering an error while working with multi-index columns. Specifically, it is failing when the `table.columns.nlevels` is being accessed and is resulting in an AttributeError because the `table` is a Series object, and Series objects do not have a 'columns' attribute.

Upon further inspection, it appears that the multi-index columns in the test case are causing the problem. The function is not handling multi-index columns correctly in some scenarios, specifically when the table is a Series instead of a DataFrame.

To fix this issue, the `pivot_table` function needs to be modified to handle the scenario where the table is a Series due to multi-index columns. This will ensure that the function works correctly for all cases, including the test case where multi-index columns are involved.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # [unchanged lines omitted for brevity]

    keys = index + columns

    # [unchanged lines omitted for brevity]

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        for v in values:
            if (
                v in data
                and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                and v in agged
                and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
            ):
                agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

    table = agged

    # Handle the case where the table is a Series due to multi-index columns
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame().T

    # [unchanged lines omitted for brevity]

    return table
```

With this correction, the `pivot_table` function will handle the scenario where the table is a Series due to multi-index columns, ensuring that it works correctly for all cases. This updated version should address the AttributeError that was encountered in the failing test case.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Please note that this corrected `pivot_table` function should be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness.
