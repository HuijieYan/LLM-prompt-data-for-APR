The buggy function appears to be performing the aggregation of the data erroneously. Despite the input columns and data types being correct and consistent with the function's requirements in all test cases, the aggregation does not seem to be occurring as expected. It seems that the aggregation logic in the function is not properly handling the different arrangements of columns in the input data, resulting in the incorrect output.

The discrepancies in the returned values suggest that the function is not correctly interpreting the columns or is not handling them properly during the aggregation process. This is evident from the incorrect values and types of the `table` and `agged` variables returned by the function, which do not match the expected results based on the given input parameters.

To address the issue, the core aggregation logic within the function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially redesigned to ensure that it appropriately considers the input columns and processes the data correctly, regardless of the column arrangements. The inconsistent behavior across multiple test cases indicates that the issue is systemic and requires a fundamental correction in the aggregation algorithm.
