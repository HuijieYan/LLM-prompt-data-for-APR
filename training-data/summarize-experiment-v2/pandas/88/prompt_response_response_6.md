## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to the `pivot_table` function in the `pandas.core.reshape.pivot` module. The failing test case is due to the `table` being a Series object instead of a DataFrame, which does not have the `columns` attribute.

The input for the `columns` argument causes the function to create a Series instead of a DataFrame. This leads to attribute access errors when trying to access the `columns` attribute.

## Potential Bug Location
The bug likely arises from the section where a Series is being returned instead of a DataFrame. This might be the result of the `cols` variable in the failing test cases, which is used to set a MultiIndex for the columns of the DataFrame inside the pivot_table function.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is using a MultiIndex for the columns, resulting in a Series being returned instead of a DataFrame. This causes attribute access errors when trying to access the `columns` attribute on the Series object.

## Suggested Fix
The `pivot_table` function should handle cases where MultiIndex columns are passed in a way that ensures a DataFrame is returned. This might involve modifying the way the columns are processed or restructuring the function to handle MultiIndex columns appropriately.

## Potential Fix
One potential fix is to modify the function to check if the input for the `columns` argument results in a MultiIndex. If it does, the function could construct a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns instead of a Series.

Here is a potential fix for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(...):
    # existing code

    # Handle MultiIndex columns
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        table = table.unstack(columns)

    # existing code
```

This fix checks if the `columns` input is a tuple, indicating a MultiIndex. If it is a tuple, the function uses the `unstack` method to convert the Series into a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

## GitHub Issue Resolution
The resolution of the GitHub issue would involve applying the potential fix. This fix should be accompanied by updated test cases to ensure that the `pivot_table` function correctly handles MultiIndex columns and returns a DataFrame instead of a Series.

## Final Corrected Code
```python
def pivot_table(...):
    # existing code

    # Handle MultiIndex columns
    if isinstance(columns, (tuple, list)):
        table = table.unstack(columns)

    # existing code
```

This corrected code ensures that the function handles MultiIndex columns and returns a DataFrame with appropriate columns.

After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
