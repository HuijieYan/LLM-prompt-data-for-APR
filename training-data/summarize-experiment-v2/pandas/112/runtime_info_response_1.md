In this buggy function, the get_indexer method is used to determine the index of the target within the IntervalIndex. It handles different situations based on the type and properties of the target and the IntervalIndex.

In Case 1, the input IntervalIndex is not overlapping, so the function should handle the non-overlapping case and return the index of the target within the IntervalIndex.

Upon analyzing the runtime values, it seems that the function is correctly identifying the properties of the target and the IntervalIndex. It checks for equality of indexes, different closed or incompatible subtypes, and then handles non-overlapping cases.

The issue may be in the logic for handling non-overlapping cases, as the conversion of the target to values and the usage of the `IntervalTree` might be causing the incorrect result. It is important to review the logic for handling non-overlapping cases and ensure that the correct index is being returned for the target within the IntervalIndex.

A potential fix could involve reviewing the logic for non-overlapping cases and ensuring that the correct index is derived from the target within the IntervalIndex. Additionally, verifying the usage of the `IntervalTree` and its impact on the final index result is necessary.
