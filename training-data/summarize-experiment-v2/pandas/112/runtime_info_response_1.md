The function is failing to correctly evaluate the comparison between the input parameter `target` and the variable `target_as_index`. On analyzing the values and types of the variables in both the input and the output, it is noted that `target_as_index` is a complete reflection of `target` and that all its attributes are equivalent to those of the `self` instance. This indicates a potential issue with the comparison logic in the function, as it should be able to correctly identify when `target_as_index` is equal to `target` in the given context. Therefore, the bug might be related to the comparison logic or the way equality is being evaluated. Further investigation of the comparison logic is necessary to address this issue.
