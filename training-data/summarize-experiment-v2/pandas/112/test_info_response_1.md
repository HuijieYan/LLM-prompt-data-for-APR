The error originates from the `test_round_interval_category_columns` function defined in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_analytics.py`. The error message is related to a `TypeError` being raised when calling the `get_indexer` method. The failure is caused by a function call with a mismatched signature, leading to a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.

It seems that the error is directly related to the buggy source code where the `get_indexer` method is implemented. The error occurs when calling the `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` method. Therefore, the issue is located within the `get_indexer` method implementation in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`.

Simplified Error Message:
```
TypeError: No matching signature found
```
