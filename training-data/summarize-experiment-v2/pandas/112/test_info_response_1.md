The error message seems to be indicating that a TypeError was encountered in the `get_indexer` method of the IntervalIndex class, which is implemented in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`.

The failing test code is attempting to create a DataFrame using `pd.interval_range` and `pd.CategoricalIndex`, and then call the `round` method on that DataFrame. This call to the `round` method ultimately leads to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is where the error is occurring.

The original error message indicates that a TypeError occurred with no matching signature found, most likely in relation to the `get_indexer` method. This suggests that there may be an issue with the types of arguments being passed to the method, or with the method itself.

A simplified version of the error is:
```
TypeError: No matching signature found
```
