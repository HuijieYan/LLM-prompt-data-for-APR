The issue is occurring in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is attempting to retrieve an indexer, but the type error is thrown, indicating a problem with the method signature.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison and indexing operations performed within the function, specifically on the `target_as_index` IntervalIndex. There could be a mismatch in the types or the comparison operations being used, leading to the type error.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the comparison and indexing operations being performed on the `target_as_index` IntervalIndex. Ensure that the comparison operations are valid for the given types and that the correct method signature is being used for the retrieval of the indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(x) for x in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected code handles the comparison and indexing operations differently depending on the type of the `target_as_index`, ensuring that the correct method signature is used for retrieval of the indexer.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
