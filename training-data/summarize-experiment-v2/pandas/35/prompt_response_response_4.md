The issue seems to be related to weak referencing and the `PeriodIndex` class, particularly in the `_engine` method.

The problem lies in the use of the `weakref.ref` function. The purpose of using `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid a reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it is intended to be used, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, one approach could be to modify the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class to properly handle the weak reference. Specifically, the weak reference should be stored as an instance variable to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference as an instance variable
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

        # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to `self` will be stored as an instance variable, ensuring that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

After making this change, the `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` statement in the failing test should return True, indicating that the bug has been fixed.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
