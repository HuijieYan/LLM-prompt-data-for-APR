Given the incomplete nature of the provided code snippet and the lack of context regarding the `cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` class, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the bug. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the issue may be related to the weak reference (`period`) being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `_engine` method returning a `NoneType` instead of the expected instance of the `_engine_type` class.

To address this bug, one potential approach for fixing the issue is to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` method. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to properly handle the weak reference and retain the reference to the PeriodIndex instance.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` method that attempts to address the issue based on the available information:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure that the weak reference is still valid
    if period() is not None:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        # This is just one possible way to handle this scenario, the actual solution may vary
        # You may need to consult with the pandas development team for the appropriate handling
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
```

Please note that the above code represents a speculative fix based on the limited information provided. It is crucial to consult the full context of the codebase and potentially engage with the pandas development team to ensure that the fix aligns with the intended behavior of the `_engine` method and the broader pandas library.

Additionally, it's important to thoroughly test the corrected `_engine` method to ensure that it passes the failing test case and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

If the provided fix does not address the issue effectively, it may be beneficial to seek guidance from experienced developers familiar with the pandas library and the specific mechanisms employed in the `_engine` method.

Please note that the provided fix is a hypothetical solution and it may require further refinement and validation within the complete codebase and test suite.
