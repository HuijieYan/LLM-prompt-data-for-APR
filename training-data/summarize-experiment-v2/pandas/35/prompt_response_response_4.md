I. Bug Analysis:
The bug is likely occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test is indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` it was expecting, resulting in an `AttributeError`. The failing test seems to be related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, and it specifically mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped earlier than intended.

II. Bug Cause:
We can infer from the failing test and the error message that the weak referencing mechanism for the `PeriodIndex` levels is not functioning as intended. This may be causing premature loss of the weak reference and leading to a `NoneType` error when the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

III. Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing mechanism within the `_engine` function is correctly implemented so that the weak reference to `self` is not prematurely dropped. This can be achieved by using a `weakref.proxy` or `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` to maintain the weak reference.

IV. Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use weakref.proxy to maintain the weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
This corrected implementation utilizes `weakref.proxy` to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and not prematurely dropped.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub by ensuring that weak references to `PeriodIndex` levels are not lost prematurely.

This corrected function should be used as a drop-in replacement in the `PeriodIndex` class.
