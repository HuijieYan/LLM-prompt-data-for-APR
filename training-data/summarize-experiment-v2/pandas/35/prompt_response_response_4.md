The issue seems to be related to weak references in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, but the reference is being lost before the intended time, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Store the weak reference in a variable to maintain its existence
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

This corrected version will store the weak reference in the `self._period_ref` attribute, ensuring that it remains in scope and is not lost prematurely. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.

Please use this corrected version of the `_engine` function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
