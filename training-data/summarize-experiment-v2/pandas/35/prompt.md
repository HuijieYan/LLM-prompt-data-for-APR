Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py

def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test is `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, which has an assert statement that checks if all x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels. This stack trace leads to `pandas/_libs/index.pyx:499`, which returns an AttributeError. 

Simplified Error Message:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The given source code appears to be incomplete, as it does not include the full context of the `@cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` function. Therefore, it is challenging to analyze and debug the code effectively without the complete context.

In the provided code snippet, it seems that the `_engine` method is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `self` object (presumably an instance of the PeriodIndex class) and the length of the PeriodIndex.

To effectively fix the bug, it's important to have access to the complete codebase, including the definition of the `cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` class, to understand the full context and dependencies of the `_engine` method.

It is also recommended to review the test cases and error messages to gain a better understanding of how the function is failing and any specific error messages or expected behaviors that are relevant to this bug. This information can provide crucial insights into the root cause of the problem and guide the debugging process.

Additionally, considering the complexity and potential dependencies of the code, it might be beneficial to seek assistance from experienced developers familiar with the project or library where this code is used, especially if the codebase is extensive and involves intricate caching mechanisms and weak references.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

This snippet of code seems to be a part of a larger codebase and it is not possible to determine the expected value and type of variables without additional context and information about the class and its attributes. If you are looking for help with a specific bug in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file, please provide more details or consider reaching out to the pandas development team for assistance.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs

Description:
When creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and checking if the levels are monotonic, it raises an error. This is because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before it should be, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Expected Output:
The check for monotonic levels should return True.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- pandas: 1.0.1
- numpy: 1.18.1
- scipy: 1.3.0
