The issue is with weak references being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. The function `_engine` is responsible for returning the `PeriodEngine`, and the `weakref` should be passed as an argument. However, the current implementation is incorrect.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly passed to the `PeriodEngine`. We can do this by modifying the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This fix properly uses the `weakref` of `self` to avoid the reference cycle and passes it as an argument to the `_engine_type` (in this case `PeriodEngine`) to create the `PeriodEngine`.

With this fix, the issue reported in the failing test should be resolved, and the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the weak reference issue and prevent the `NoneType` error.
