The issue stems from the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' at line 499 in pandas/_libs/index.pyx.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely so that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, incorporating the fix:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference.
