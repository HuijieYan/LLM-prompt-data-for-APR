Based on the input parameters, expected variable values, and the GitHub issue, the bug appears to be caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError raised in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be accomplished by modifying the _engine function to use the weakref package's ref() method to create the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and then using it as an argument when calling self._engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex will be maintained for as long as it's needed, resolving the AttributeError issue.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test, resolving the bug and addressing the GitHub issue.
