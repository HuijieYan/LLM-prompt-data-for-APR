Based on the given information, the issue seems to be related to weak references within the PeriodIndex class. The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is getting dropped when it shouldn't be, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` method should create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and pass it to the `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex will be maintained, preventing the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
