The bug is causing an AttributeError when accessing the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `idx2` variable, which is a MultiIndex. This error is due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it is intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained until it is no longer needed. The `_engine` function should return the weak reference to `self` instead of the `period` variable.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return weakref.ref(self, lambda period: self._engine_type(period, len(self)))
```

This code ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by using a lambda function to create the `_engine_type` instance when the weak reference is dereferenced.

With this change, the failing test should pass and the issue described in the GitHub bug report should be resolved.
