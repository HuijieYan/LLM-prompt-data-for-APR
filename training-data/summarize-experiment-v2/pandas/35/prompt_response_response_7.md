The issue seems to be with the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object. The `weakref.ref(self)` is not holding a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object as expected.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` method to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` in order to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This should resolve the weak reference issue and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly referenced within the `_engine` method.

Once this change is made, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.

With this fix, the corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
