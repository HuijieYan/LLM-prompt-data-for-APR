The issue with the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak referencing of the `self` object. The weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the `NoneType` error. The function should be modified to correctly handle the weak referencing of the `self` object to avoid the error.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to be updated to properly maintain the weak reference to the `self` object. By using the `weakref.ref` method, the weak reference can be stored as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class, allowing it to be properly maintained.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class, the reference cycle issue should be resolved and the `NoneType` error should no longer occur.

With this fix, the test case should pass, and the previously mentioned bug on GitHub should also be resolved.
