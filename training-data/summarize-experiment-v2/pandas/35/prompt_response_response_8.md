### Analysis
From the error message and the runtime value and type of the variables, it can be inferred that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected value, which leads to an AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.

The `PeriodIndex` class contains the `_engine` method, which is marked with the `@cache_readonly` decorator. This decorator is likely responsible for caching the result of the method and returning the cached value on subsequent calls. However, based on the error message, it seems that the cached value is not being set correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

The failing test is attempting to perform some index operations on a `MultiIndex` that involves using the `is_monotonic` attribute, which eventually leads to accessing the `view` attribute, resulting in the AttributeError.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug seems to be related to the caching behavior of the `_engine` method. It appears that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the caching logic not working as intended.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Investigate the caching mechanism used by the `@cache_readonly` decorator and ensure that it properly caches the result of the `_engine` method.
2. Verify that the weak reference to `self` is being used correctly in the `_engine` method and that it is not being dropped prematurely.
3. Check for any possible inconsistencies or edge cases in the caching logic that may lead to the incorrect behavior.

### Corrected Code
```python
from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure that the result is properly cached
    self._engine = result
    return result
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the result of the `_engine` method is properly cached in the `self._engine` attribute. This should address the caching issue and prevent the premature dropping of weak references, ultimately resolving the AttributeError and fixing the bug.
