GitHub Bug Title:
TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype

Description:
Using the new nullable integer data type, calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError. It works with int64 dtype and also with Int64 dtype when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy. The error occurs with median and std as well. However, it does not occur with min, max, or first.

Expected Output:
When performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of nullable integer data type (Int64), the following behaviours are expected for the specified methods:
mean(): The method should compute the mean of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
median():The method should compute the median of grouped data without raising a TypeError.
std(): The method should compute the standard deviation of grouped data without raising a TypeError.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0

    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
As per comment by @jacobaustin123:
import pandas as pd
idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([pd.PeriodIndex([pd.Period("2019Q1"), pd.Period("2019Q2")], name='b')])
idx2 = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])
all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels) # raises an error

Problem description
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex er dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Expected Output
The above should return True.
