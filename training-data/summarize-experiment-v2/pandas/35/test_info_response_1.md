The failing test is `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, which has an assert statement that checks if all x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels. This stack trace leads to `pandas/_libs/index.pyx:499`, which returns an AttributeError. 

Simplified Error Message:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
