The issue in the buggy function is that it returns a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, but the weak reference is lost before it should be. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function needs to be preserved for the lifetime of the returned `_engine_type` object. One way to achieve this is to make `period` an instance variable by assigning it to `self.period`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self.period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self.period, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to `self` will be preserved for the lifetime of the returned `_engine_type` object, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to `self`.

This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
