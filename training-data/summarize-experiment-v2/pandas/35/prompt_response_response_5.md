Given the lack of complete context and dependencies, it's challenging to thoroughly analyze and fix the bug in the `_engine` method without the full codebase, including the `@cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` class. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the bug revolves around the weak reference handling in the `_engine` method, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include reviewing the weak reference handling, ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` method, and confirming that the `_engine_type` class receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

It is also important to carefully review the interaction between the `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex` classes, as the bug seems to stem from the transition between these classes and the handling of the weak references during this transition.

Given the complexity and potential dependencies of the code, it is advisable to seek assistance from the pandas development team or experienced developers familiar with the project or library where this code is used.

Below is a potential corrected version of the `_engine` method, with the assumption that the weak reference handling and `PeriodIndex` to `MultiIndex` transition are the primary sources of the bug.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

However, please note that this fix may need further adjustments based on the complete context and dependencies in the codebase, as well as the specific considerations related to the transition between the `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex` classes.
