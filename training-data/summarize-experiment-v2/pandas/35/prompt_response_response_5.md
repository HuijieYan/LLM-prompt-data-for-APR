The bug is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the AttributeError when trying to retrieve the index values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be done by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference as an attribute of the PeriodIndex instance.

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the PeriodIndex instance, we ensure that it is not prematurely dropped and remains available for the PeriodEngine to use.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

Here's the entire corrected function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to fix the issue.
