Given the context provided, it appears that the issue with the @cache_readonly decorator and the _engine_type class is causing the _engine method to return a NoneType object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

To address this issue, a possible approach for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely when creating the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine_type_instance
```

This corrected code aims to preserve the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object and ensure that the _engine_type instance is not None. By incorporating this check, the corrected code aims to resolve the issues identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to the bug.
