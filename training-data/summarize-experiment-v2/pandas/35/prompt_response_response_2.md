The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of weakref. The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being lost too soon, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being lost prematurely, which results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the usage of weakref in the _engine method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained for as long as needed. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created and utilized in the _engine method.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

    # Define a custom method that utilizes the weak reference
    def create_engine(period_weakref, length):
        return self._engine_type(period_weakref, length)

    # Use the custom method to create the engine
    return create_engine(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a custom method that utilizes the weak reference and ensures that it's maintained during the engine creation, we ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

With this change, the _engine method will now correctly maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex, preventing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
