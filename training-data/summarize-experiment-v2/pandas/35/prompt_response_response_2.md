The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is causing the issue. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should. This causes an `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until its intended usage.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_engine` function so that it returns the weakref of `self` rather than the direct value of `self`. This will prevent the weak reference from being discarded prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return period
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

This fix ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is preserved until its intended usage, resolving the problem and providing the expected output.
