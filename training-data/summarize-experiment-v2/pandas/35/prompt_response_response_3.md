The issue seems to be related to weak references and a problem with the `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels are monotonic, but it is encountering an AttributeError due to weak referencing problems.

Based on the information provided, it is likely that the weak reference of the `self` object is not being handled correctly in the `_engine` method, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, it is important to review the codebase and gain a thorough understanding of the `@cache_readonly` decorator, the `_engine_type` class, and the weak referencing mechanism used in the `_engine` method. 

Once the issue is understood, potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring proper handling of weak references in the `_engine` method to prevent premature deletion of the `self` object.
2. Checking for any missing or incorrect implementations of weak references in the `_engine_type` constructor.
3. Reviewing the caching mechanism to ensure it does not interfere with weak references.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method that addresses the weak referencing issue:

```python
# Updated version of the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This updated version includes a check for `period() is not None` before calling the `_engine_type` constructor to ensure that the weak reference is still valid. This change should address the weak referencing problem and prevent the AttributeError encountered in the failing test case.

After applying this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully without any AttributeError related to weak references, and the levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex object should be monotonic as expected. This fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to weak references in the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
