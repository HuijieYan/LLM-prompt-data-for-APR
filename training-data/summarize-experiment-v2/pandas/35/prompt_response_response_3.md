The buggy function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError due to 'NoneType' object being returned when calling `PeriodEngine`. This means the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The issue lies in the _engine function, where it needs to properly handle the weak reference to self to ensure that it is not unexpectedly garbage collected. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the PeriodIndex object and its associated weak references.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the _engine function to properly handle the weakref of self, ensuring that it remains valid throughout the function's execution.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
