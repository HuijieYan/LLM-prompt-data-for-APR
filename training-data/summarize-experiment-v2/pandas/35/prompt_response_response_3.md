Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly method that returns the engine type for the `PeriodIndex`.
(b). The `PeriodIndex` class is responsible for creating and managing the index keys that are boxed to Period objects.
(c). The failing test is attempting to create a `MultiIndex` from the `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it fails due to the weak reference issue.
(d). The error message indicates an AttributeError with the `PeriodEngine` getting a NoneType.

Discrepancies:
(e). Actual input/output variable information: The weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method is causing the `self` object to be dropped prematurely, leading to a NoneType error.
(f). Expected input/output variable information: The `_engine` method should correctly handle weak referencing and return the engine type without any issues.

GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue title is "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs". The detailed description explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before intended, leading to the `None` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_engine` method to properly handle weak references to `self` and ensure that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely.
2. Review the caching mechanism used in the `_engine` method and ensure that it correctly retains the weak reference to `self`.
3. Consider restructuring the handling of weak references in the `_engine` method to prevent the loss of reference to `self`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
In the corrected code, we are using the weak reference `period` to check if it is not None before returning the engine type. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and the engine type is returned only if the weak reference has not been dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue described in the GitHub bug report should be resolved.
