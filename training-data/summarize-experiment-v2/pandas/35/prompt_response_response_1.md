The issue is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained as expected.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and used as intended, preventing the issue with the dropped weak reference.

With this fix, the failing test case should now pass, and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.
