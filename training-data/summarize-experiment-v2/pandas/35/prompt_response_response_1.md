Upon analyzing the problematic function and the failing test, it's evident that the bug arises due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The bug likely occurs in the `@cache_readonly` decorator. This decorator is meant to cache the result of the `_engine` method so that it is calculated only once, effectively caching the result upon the first invocation. However, due to the weak reference, the caching mechanism might not be working as intended.

To fix the bug, the caching mechanism in the `_engine` method should be revised to correctly utilize the weakref for caching and return the calculated result when the method is invoked subsequently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine = weakref.ref(engine)
    return engine
```

This fix ensures that the result of the `_engine` method is correctly cached using the weak reference, preventing the dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended.

With this fix, the `PeriodIndex._engine` method should now return the expected output and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
