To effectively fix the bug, it's important to have access to the complete codebase, including the definition of the `cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` class, to fully understand the context and dependencies of the `_engine` method. However, based on the provided information and assuming the most common cases, the bug might be related to weak reference handling within the `_engine` method.

The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" indicates that the `_engine` method is receiving a NoneType object when it expects a valid instance to operate on, possibly due to weak reference handling or caching issues.

To address this issue, it's recommended to carefully review the weak reference usage and caching mechanism within the `_engine` method and ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and utilized to avoid premature deallocation or invalid references.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is properly managed and retrieved to avoid premature deallocation or NoneType return.
2. Reviewing the caching mechanism used in the `_engine` method and verifying that it correctly handles weak references to avoid invalid returns.

Without the complete context of the code, it's challenging to provide a specific and accurate fix for the bug. However, based on common patterns, here is a corrected version of the `_engine` method with some assumptions:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if self is not None:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid self reference")
```

Please note that this corrected version assumes that the weak reference to `self` is being used correctly and that the `_engine_type` class appropriately handles weak references. It's crucial to test this corrected version thoroughly, especially in the context of the failing test case, to ensure that it resolves the bug and does not introduce new issues. Additionally, further adjustments may be necessary based on the complete code context and dependencies.

However, it is crucial to notice that actual corrective code should be based on the proper understanding of the code context (as mentioned in Point 1) and should closely align with the specs presented in Point 5.
