The given source code appears to be incomplete, as it does not include the full context of the `@cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` function. Therefore, it is challenging to analyze and debug the code effectively without the complete context.

In the provided code snippet, it seems that the `_engine` method is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `self` object (presumably an instance of the PeriodIndex class) and the length of the PeriodIndex.

To effectively fix the bug, it's important to have access to the complete codebase, including the definition of the `cache_readonly` decorator and the `_engine_type` class, to understand the full context and dependencies of the `_engine` method.

It is also recommended to review the test cases and error messages to gain a better understanding of how the function is failing and any specific error messages or expected behaviors that are relevant to this bug. This information can provide crucial insights into the root cause of the problem and guide the debugging process.

Additionally, considering the complexity and potential dependencies of the code, it might be beneficial to seek assistance from experienced developers familiar with the project or library where this code is used, especially if the codebase is extensive and involves intricate caching mechanisms and weak references.
