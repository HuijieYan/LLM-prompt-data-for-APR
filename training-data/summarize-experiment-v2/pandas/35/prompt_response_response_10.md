The issue is occurring because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to change the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference to `self`. We can use the `weakref.proxy` function, which allows access to the referenced object without strong reference to it. This will ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code with the fix:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained until it is no longer needed, resolving the issue.

This fix should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, successfully resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
