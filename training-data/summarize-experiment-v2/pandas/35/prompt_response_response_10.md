Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to access weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects, and it seems that the weak reference is lost prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The cause of the bug seems to be the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object before it is intended to be dropped.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained in the `_engine` function until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function (`_engine`) in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference until the creation of `engine_type`, we can ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
