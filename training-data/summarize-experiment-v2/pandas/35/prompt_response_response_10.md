Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is related to weak references being dropped prematurely when creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex, resulting in an AttributeError. To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped too early.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function with potential fixes:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Necessary imports
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))


# The declarations of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    ... (additional class documentation)
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.PeriodIndex(year=year_arr, quarter=q_arr)
    """


# A failing test function for the buggy function
# The failing test has been omitted as it is not part of the function itself.
```

This correction involves using a weak reference (`period_ref`) of `self` when calling `_engine_type` to ensure that the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped.

It's important to note that this fix assumes that _engine_type is implemented correctly. If there are issues in _engine_type or elsewhere in the codebase, further debugging may be necessary.

As for the failing test (`test_get_level_values_when_periods`), it should now pass with the corrected version of the `_engine` function. The fix should ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped before it should be, resolving the AttributeError and allowing the check for monotonic levels to return True.

It's also important to make sure that this fix aligns with the resolution of the GitHub issue related to the bug. If the fix resolves the issue described, then it should be ready for testing and merging into the main codebase.
