Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the error is related to the case where 'columns' is set to None in the pivot function call. This contradicts the actual behavior described in the documentation and the GitHub issue, which states that 'columns' is a required argument and cannot be None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'columns' argument when it is None.

Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking if 'columns' is None in the beginning of the function and raising a KeyError if it is not provided.
2. Updating the function signature and documentation to reflect that 'columns' is a required argument.
3. Modifying the test case to directly check for the KeyError when 'columns' is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the above requirements:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise KeyError("The 'columns' argument in the pivot function is required and cannot be None.")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

By including the check for the 'columns' argument at the beginning of the pivot function, and raising a KeyError if it is None, we ensure that the function now behaves as expected. This fixes the bug and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
