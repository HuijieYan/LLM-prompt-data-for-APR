The error message indicates a KeyError, which occurs at several locations during the code execution, ultimately originating in the pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py file, particularly at the `MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])` line. This error is further thrown from the pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper.pxi file.

Simplified error message:
KeyError occurred at line 441 in the pivot function in pivot.py file resulted from multiple stack frames including the get_loc method in base.py and index.pyx files.
