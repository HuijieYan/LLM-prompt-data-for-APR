Based on the analysis of the runtime values and type of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the calculation of the business hours. The values of the "businesshours" variable for all the test cases are consistently set to 7200, which suggests that the calculation logic is not correctly processing the input parameters.

The correct business hours should be calculated based on the difference between the "other" timestamp and the start time of the CustomBusinessHour. This calculation is likely affected by the "n" parameter as well.

To fix the bug, investigate the code that calculates the business hours and ensure that it correctly accounts for the timestamps and the specified CustomBusinessHours. Additionally, check for any issues related to the usage of the "n" parameter in the calculation logic.
