The given buggy function is `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on a custom business hour. However, the function is complicated and difficult to understand, making it challenging to identify the specific bug. The function relies on a number of related functions within the same file, as well as a failing test function from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.

The error message provided suggests that the issue is related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency. This error occurs within the function `_validate_frequency` and is triggered by the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem arises when using `pd.date_range` with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays, causing the method to produce unexpected results. The expected output is to produce the correct number of periods without dividing the dates unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to thoroughly analyze the logic of the `apply` function and potentially simplify it. Additionally, thorough testing with various input scenarios is essential to ensure the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
  
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjusted timezone and nanosecond
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the corrected function may not completely resolve the bug without thorough testing due to its complex logic and dependency on related functions.

It is also important to thoroughly test this corrected function with various input scenarios, including the failing test case, to ensure that it behaves as expected and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
