Based on the analysis of the buggy function and related information, the potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation and adjustment of the variable "other" based on the input value of "n".

The bug's cause is that the input frequency is not adjusted properly when a holiday is present, causing the frequency to produce more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, the adjustment code related to holidays and business hours needs to be modified to ensure that the frequency adheres to the expected number of periods even when holidays are included.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Add adjustment for holidays
            if self.holidays:
                curr_date = other.date()
                while curr_date in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    curr_date = other.date()

            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if self.n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function includes adjustments for holidays to ensure that the frequency adheres to the expected number of periods. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
