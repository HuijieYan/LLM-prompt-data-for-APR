The potential error in the buggy function is found to be related to the calculations involving the "n" variable and the "other" variable. The issue seems to be causing incorrect frequencies when periods and holidays are used together. 

By analyzing the provided failing test function and the related input-output value pairs, it becomes clear that the function does not handle the effect of holidays effectively, leading to unexpected frequencies in the output of the date_range function.

To fix this issue, the adjustments needed in the function involve properly handling the impact of holidays on the frequencies and ensuring that the date_range function adheres to the expected behavior even when holidays are present.

A corrected version of the function that addresses the aforementioned issue is provided below:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and isinstance(self.holidays, list) and other in self.holidays:
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = other + timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() < 5 and other not in self.holidays:
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() < 5 and other not in self.holidays:
                        n += 1
            return other

        # Original calculation without holidays
        else:
            # remaining code stays the same...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function incorporates the handling of holidays to ensure that the date_range function behaves as expected when both periods and holidays are used together. It also maintains the original functionality for cases without holidays.

With this corrected code, the failing test cases involving date_range with custom business hours and holidays are expected to pass, and the issue reported in the corresponding GitHub thread should be resolved.
