Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

This error occurs at line 891 of `datetimelike.py`, as indicated by the file path. The error message is related to the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` found in the `test_date_range.py` file.

The error message specifies the problem occurs at line 891 in the `_validate_frequency` method of `datetimelike.py`. The root cause of the error appears to be due to the fact that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency, in this case it does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

Simplified error message:
```
ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the analysis of the runtime values and type of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the calculation of the business hours. The values of the "businesshours" variable for all the test cases are consistently set to 7200, which suggests that the calculation logic is not correctly processing the input parameters.

The correct business hours should be calculated based on the difference between the "other" timestamp and the start time of the CustomBusinessHour. This calculation is likely affected by the "n" parameter as well.

To fix the bug, investigate the code that calculates the business hours and ensure that it correctly accounts for the timestamps and the specified CustomBusinessHours. Additionally, check for any issues related to the usage of the "n" parameter in the calculation logic.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

# GitHub Issue: Pandas date_range and holiday issue
## Description
The code for creating date ranges with pandas works fine, but when adding holidays, it produces more periods than specified. Replacing 'periods' with the corresponding 'end' solves the issue. Looking for help to understand this behavior.


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, related functions, test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, the expected input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class docs
   (c). The related functions
   (d). The failing test
   (e). The corresponding error message
   (f). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value
   (g). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value
   (h). The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
   (b). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
   (c). Successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub
