Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python

from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, _get_calendar, _is_normalized, _to_dt64, apply_index_wraps, as_datetime, roll_yearday, shift_month

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the given information, it seems that the variable "n" and "other" are directly contributing to the buggy function result. The other variables with various names do not seem to have a notable impact on the function's return values. Here are the simplified input-output value pairs for the failing test cases:

## Simplified Input-Output Value Pairs

### Case 1
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `3`
- Output:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-27 16:00:00')`
  - `n`: `3`

### Case 2
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

### Case 3
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

### Case 4
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

### Case 5
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00', freq='CBH')`
  - `self.n`: `3`
- Output:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-27 16:00:00')`
  - `n`: `3`

### Case 6
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00', freq='CBH')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

### Case 7
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

### Case 8
- Input:
  - `other`: `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`
  - `self.n`: `1`
- Output:
  - `other`: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`
  - `n`: `1`

By focusing on the variables "other" and "n" in the input and output value pairs, we can identify the specific issue causing the failing test cases.


# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
This code works fine

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
Output:

               '2020-12-02 12:00:00'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='CBH')
If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',end='2020-11-27 16:00:00',
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
