The issue seems to be related to the calculation of dates when using custom business hours and holidays in the `pd.date_range` function from the `pandas` library. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file is attempting to call the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency, resulting in an error due to the inferred frequency being `None`.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem, where using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays results in unexpected behavior, producing more periods than expected.

Upon analysis of the provided source code and error message, it appears that the root cause of the issue lies in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The `apply` function is responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, and it seems that the adjustment logic may not be correctly accounting for holidays, leading to unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

To fix this issue, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class needs to be reviewed and potentially updated to properly handle holidays while calculating the adjusted datetime based on business hours.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to enhance the logic within the `apply` function to check for holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly. This may involve incorporating the logic to skip holidays and adjust the datetime based on business hours and holidays.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, updated to handle holidays properly:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holidays
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            # Adjust the datetime to the next business day
            other = self.next_bday._next_opening_time(other)

        # Rest of the logic for adjusting based on business hours remains unchanged
        
        # ... (existing logic for adjusting based on business hours)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this correction, we have added a check for holidays in the `apply` function, and if the date falls on a holiday, the logic has been updated to adjust the datetime to the next business day.

This correction should address the issue and ensure that `pd.date_range` works as expected when using custom business hours and holidays.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the `BusinessHourMixin` class has the necessary logic to handle holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly.

By incorporating the suggested correction in the `apply` function, the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should also be resolved, as the correction accounts for holidays and adjusts the datetime based on business hours, preventing the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test.
