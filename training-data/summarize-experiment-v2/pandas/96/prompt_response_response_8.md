The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours and other parameters. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to call the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, but it is failing due to an error that occurs in the `_validate_frequency` function. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be related to the calculation of business days and business hours in the `apply` function, which is then used to adjust the input datetime. This calculation may not be considering the holidays effectively, leading to an incorrect adjustment.

From the GitHub issue, it is clear that when using periods and adding holidays, the `pd.date_range` function produces more periods than expected, resulting in an incorrect output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic of the `apply` function and ensure that it properly handles the adjustment of datetime based on business hours and holidays. Additionally, the calculation of business days and hours should be reviewed to account for holidays properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... existing code ...

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Consider holidays when finding the next opening time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=1, holidays=self.holidays)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # Consider holidays when finding the next opening time and closing time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=-1, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # ... remaining code ...
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction includes considering holidays when finding the next opening and closing time, which should help in handling the adjustment of business hours and days effectively.

This corrected code should be able to pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
