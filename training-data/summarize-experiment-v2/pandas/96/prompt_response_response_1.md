The issue is related to the inferred frequency from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency CBH when using periods and adding holidays. The bug is within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

After reviewing the code and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the variable adjustments made based on the `n` and `other` variables within the `apply` function. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours seems to be causing the discrepancies in the output frequency.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours needs to be modified. Specifically, the adjustment logic in the branches for `n >= 0` and `n < 0` should be revised to ensure the correct adjustment of days and hours based on the provided input.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for business days
        if n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                # Add business days
                other = next_business_day(other, n)
            else:
                # Subtract business days
                other = previous_business_day(other, abs(n))

        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        business_hour = timedelta(hours=1)
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += business_hour
                while not is_business_hour(other):
                    other += business_hour
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other -= business_hour
                while not is_business_hour(other):
                    other -= business_hour
                    n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours has been refactored to ensure that the correct adjustments are made based on the provided input. The `next_business_day` and `previous_business_day` functions are assumed to be correctly implemented elsewhere. Additionally, the `is_business_hour` function is assumed to correctly identify business hours.

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
