# GitHub Issue: Pandas date_range and holiday issue
## Description
The code for creating date ranges with pandas works fine, but when adding holidays, it produces more periods than specified. Replacing 'periods' with the corresponding 'end' solves the issue. Looking for help to understand this behavior.
