## Issue Analysis

The provided buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on a custom business hour. However, it contains complex logic and conditional statements, making it difficult to identify a specific bug based on the provided information.

The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the calculated business hours and seems to be affecting the resulting frequency.

The error message is triggered by the function `_validate_frequency` and indicates a value error due to an incorrect inferred frequency.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the use of `pd.date_range` with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` and the addition of holidays is creating unexpected division of dates, resulting in more dates than intended.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the complex logic in the `apply` function, which may have issues with adjusting the timestamp based on the custom business hour. Additionally, there might be issues with handling holidays and the resulting frequency.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Understand the custom business hour logic and how it should adjust timestamps.
2. Verify the handling of holidays in the custom business hour logic.
3. Review the implementation of the `_validate_frequency` function and its interaction with the custom business hour.
4. Simplify the logic in the `apply` function to make it easier to understand and debug.
5. Thoroughly test the function with various input scenarios, including holidays, to identify and fix any inconsistencies.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    if other.time() in self.start:
        start_index = self.start.index(other.time())
        next_opening = other
    else:
        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
        start_index = 0

    if self.n >= 0:
        if next_opening.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(next_opening):
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)

    total_business_hours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(
            self.start[i], self.end[i]
        ) for i in range(start_index, len(self.start) - 1)
    )

    num_business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(
        abs(self.n * 60), total_business_hours // 60
    )
    if self.n < 0:
        num_business_days, remaining_hours = -num_business_days, -remaining_hours

    adjusted_time = next_opening
    if num_business_days != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=num_business_days)
        adjusted_time += skip_bd

    if remaining_hours != 0:
        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

    return adjusted_time
```

Please note that this corrected code is a simplified version of the `apply` function. It assumes that the `BusinessDay` and other related functions work correctly. Thorough testing is necessary to ensure the correct behavior of the corrected function.
