The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. It seems that the adjustment for business days and business hours is not properly handling the given input. 

The function needs to accurately calculate the adjusted datetime based on the given business hours and business days.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling the business days and business hours to accurately calculate the adjusted datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
