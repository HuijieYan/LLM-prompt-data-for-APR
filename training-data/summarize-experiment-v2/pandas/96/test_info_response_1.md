This error occurs at line 891 of `datetimelike.py`, as indicated by the file path. The error message is related to the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` found in the `test_date_range.py` file.

The error message specifies the problem occurs at line 891 in the `_validate_frequency` method of `datetimelike.py`. The root cause of the error appears to be due to the fact that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency, in this case it does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

Simplified error message:
```
ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH
```
