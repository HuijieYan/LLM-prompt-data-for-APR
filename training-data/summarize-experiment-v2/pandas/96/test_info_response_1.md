The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` at `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is trying to call the `pd` function `date_range` with custom business hours. The error message seems to be originating from the `cls._validate_frequency` at `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py:246`. The error occurred due to the frequency not conforming to the passed frequency `CBH`, specifically because the inferred frequency was `None`.

Simplified Error Message:
```
ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH
```
