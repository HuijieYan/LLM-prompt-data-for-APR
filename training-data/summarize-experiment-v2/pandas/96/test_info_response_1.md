Looking at the error message, we can infer that the error originates from the function `_validate_frequency(cls, index, freq, **kwargs)`. Within this function, the line `if index.size == 0 or inferred == freq.freqstr:` condition is not meeting properly, and this triggers a `ValueError`.

The failure is provoked from the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` located in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` as it invokes the function `pd.date_range` with a custom business frequency defined by `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`. 

To simplify the original error message, we can summarize it to: 

```
Error on line 891 in pandas/core/arrays/datetimelike.py: Value error was raised in the _validate_frequency function. The inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH.
```
