Based on the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the issue lies with the multiplication operation being applied to the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. The `right` Series contains NaT (Not a Time) values, which are specific to time-based data in pandas.

The error seems to be caused by the fact that the DataFrame `left` is trying to perform element-wise multiplication with the Series `right`, resulting in the incorrect values of 'NaT' being produced in the resulting ndarray. This type of operation is not appropriate for timedelta data and is causing the discrepancy in the test cases.

To address the issue, you would need to check the logic of the function to ensure that the correct operation is being applied, taking into account the specific non-numeric nature of the `right` Series. This may involve updating the logic to handle the presence of NaT values appropriately, such as through filtering or applying a different operation that is suitable for timedelta data.
