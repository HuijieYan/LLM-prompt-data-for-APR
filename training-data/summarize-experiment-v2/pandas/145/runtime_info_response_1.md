In this buggy function, the dispatch_to_series function is designed to evaluate frame operations by iterating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It supports different types of inputs for the right parameter, including scalars, DataFrames, and Series.

In Case 1, the buggy function is called with various inputs, including a DataFrame (left) and a Series (right) with the axis parameter set to "columns". The function then attempts to perform the operation using the column-wise operation specified by the func parameter.

At the end of the function, the variables right and a seem to have been transformed or processed incorrectly, leading to incorrect values and types. This suggests that the implementation of the column-wise operation and the evaluation using expressions.evaluate might not be consistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function's logic for handling the column-wise operation and evaluation using expressions.evaluate needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data. Additionally, the handling of different input types for the right parameter needs to be re-examined to ensure proper dispatching and operation.
