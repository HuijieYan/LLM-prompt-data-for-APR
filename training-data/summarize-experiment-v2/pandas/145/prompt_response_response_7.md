The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of different input types for the right parameter and the subsequent column-wise operation and evaluation using expressions.evaluate.

The bug's cause could be related to incorrect transformations and operations applied to the input data, leading to unexpected values and types in the actual output variables. This discrepancy between the actual input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values could be causing the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing and revising the logic for handling the column-wise operation and evaluation using expressions.evaluate to ensure the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data.
2. Re-examining the handling of different input types for the right parameter to ensure proper dispatching and operation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.column_op(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected code will ensure that the appropriate column-wise operations are performed on the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`, and the result is evaluated correctly using expressions.column_op. This fix should address the potential issues in the original buggy function and pass the failing test.
