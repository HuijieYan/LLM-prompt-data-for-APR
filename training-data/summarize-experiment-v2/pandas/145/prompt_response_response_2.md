The potential error location within the problematic function `dispatch_to_series` is likely in the column_op functions and the evaluation using expressions.evaluate.

The identified cause of the bug is that the actual input/output variable value and the expected input/output variable value seem to be inconsistent due to incorrect transformations and operations applied to the input data, as well as potential issues with the handling of different input types for the right parameter.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the column-wise operation and the evaluation using expressions.evaluate should be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data. Additionally, the handling of different input types for the right parameter needs to be re-examined to ensure proper dispatching and operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by simplifying the column_op functions and ensuring that the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data. It also includes proper handling of different input types for the right parameter to ensure proper dispatching and operation. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
