Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue with the buggy function lies in the column-wise operation and the evaluation using expressions.evaluate. The improper transformation and processing of variables `right` and `a` might be causing incorrect values and types.

To fix the bug, let's first review the column-wise operation and the expression evaluation to ensure the correct transformations and operations are applied, and then re-examine the handling of different input types for the `right` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/ops/__init__.py

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    # Removed the usage of expressions.evaluate and directly creating a new DataFrame
    new_data = pd.DataFrame(data, index=left.index)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we directly create a dictionary `data` based on the column-wise operations, then use this dictionary to create a new DataFrame `new_data` with the correct values and index. This approach ensures that the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.

With this correction, the function should be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
