The issue in the `dispatch_to_series` function appears to be with the handling of the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The function is attempting to perform the operation directly on the underlying NumPy array, which results in the "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" error.

To fix this issue, the multiplication operation should be performed by broadcasting the operation over the DataFrame and the Series at the Pandas level. This will ensure that the NaT values are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[col]), axis=0)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right), axis=0)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), axis=0)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values, and it should pass the failing test case.
