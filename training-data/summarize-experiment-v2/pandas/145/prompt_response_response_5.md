Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is during the column-wise operation and evaluation using expressions.evaluate. It seems that the transformation or processing of the variables 'right' and 'a' might not be correct, leading to the TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType'.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the column-wise operation and evaluation, leading to inconsistencies in the types and values of the variables. This results in the unsupported operand type error when trying to perform the multiplication operation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the column-wise operation for different input types of the 'right' parameter is handled correctly and consistently.
2. Check the types and values of the variables 'right' and 'a' before performing the operation and evaluation, and make any necessary transformations or adjustments.
3. Verify that the expressions.evaluate function is being called with the correct input types and that the operation is being performed as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
