The issue with the buggy function seems to be that when the input `right` is a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`, the function defined does not handle the case properly. It is allowed for scalar `right` or `right` with the same index as `left`, but it is not handled correctly for a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`.

To fix this, we need to modify the conditional statements to handle the case when `right` is a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and the `axis` is "columns". We also need to make sure the output is a DataFrame with the expected values and types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame(data={i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With the above fix, the function should now handle the case when `right` is a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and the `axis` is "columns" correctly. It will return a DataFrame with the expected values and types. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
