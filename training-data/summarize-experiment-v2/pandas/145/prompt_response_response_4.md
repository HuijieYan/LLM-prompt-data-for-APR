The issue with the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the `column_op` function that is being used to perform the operations column-wise. The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" indicates that the multiplication operation is being performed between unsupported operand types, specifically between a numpy array and NaT values.

Upon inspecting the code, it seems that the issue is related to the implementation of the `column_op` function, which is not handling the NaT values correctly. It is likely that the presence of NaT values is causing the multiplication operation to fail.

To fix this issue, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle NaT values appropriately when performing the multiplication operation.

Here's a possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Update the `column_op` function to handle NaT values when performing the multiplication operation.
2. Check for NaT values in the input Series and replace them with a suitable default value before performing the operation.
3. Ensure that the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and Series handles the presence of NaT values gracefully.

Below is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if np.issubdtype(b.dtype, np.datetime64):
                # Handle NaT values in the Series
                b = b.where(~b.isna(), np.nan)  # Replace NaT with NaN
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    # ... (other cases)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This modification checks for datetime64 values in the Series and handles NaT values appropriately by replacing them with NaN before performing the multiplication operation.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be able to handle the presence of NaT values when performing operations between DataFrames and Series.

This correction should allow the function to pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
