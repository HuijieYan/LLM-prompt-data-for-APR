Based on the analysis of the buggy function and related code, the potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is the `expressions.evaluate` call. It seems that the evaluation using the `column_op` function might not be consistent with the expected behavior, leading to the incorrect values and types.

The cause of the bug involves incorrect processing of input data and the application of the column-wise operation. The evaluation of the operation using `expressions.evaluate` might not be handling the input data properly, leading to the unsupported operation type error.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the column-wise operation and the evaluation using `expressions.evaluate` needs to be reviewed and revised to ensure correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data. Additionally, the handling of different input types for the `right` parameter needs to be re-examined to ensure proper dispatching and operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), args=(right.columns,))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), args=(right.index,))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the column-wise operation is performed using the `apply` method on the DataFrame `left`, ensuring that the operation is conducted correctly for each column. The handling of different types for the `right` parameter has been revised to align with the expected behavior.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
