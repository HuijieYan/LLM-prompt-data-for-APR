The potential error in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of different input types for the `right` parameter and the subsequent column-wise operation and evaluation using `expressions.evaluate`.

The error message indicates that the multiplication operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType' is not supported, suggesting that the handling of the numpy array and `NaTType` (Not a Time) values in the column-wise operation or evaluation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different input types for the `right` parameter should be reviewed and potentially revised. Additionally, the column-wise operation and evaluation using `expressions.evaluate` should be carefully examined to ensure proper handling of numpy arrays and `NaTType` values.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function with the potential fix:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = column_op(left, right)  # Call column_op directly with left and right
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is called directly with `left` and `right` parameters to ensure that the column-wise operation is performed correctly. By doing this, we avoid potential issues with the dispatching and evaluation of different input types.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the buggy function.
