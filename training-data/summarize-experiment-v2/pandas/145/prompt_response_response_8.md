The problem in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the treatment of the timedelta data type when performing operations on DataFrames and Series.

Based on the failing test case and the provided information, it seems that the error is occurring when the function is trying to multiply the DataFrame with the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `mul` operation for the `timedelta64` type.

To fix this issue, it may be necessary to handle the multiplication operation specifically for the `timedelta64[ns]` type.

A possible approach to fix the bug could involve checking the data type of the operands and then applying a suitable method for the multiplication operation, especially when dealing with the `timedelta64[ns]` type.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if isinstance(right, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
            new_data = left * right
            return new_data

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes specific handling for the `timedelta64[ns]` type when applying the `mul` operation on the DataFrame. It checks if the right operand is of type `timedelta64` and performs the operation accordingly.
