Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

Based on the error message received from running the test, the root cause of the failure seems to be related to the `mul` operation (multiplication) between a DataFrame and a Series. The error originates from the built-in function `mul` being unable to process the operation due to unsupported operand types. The presence of the `NaTType` is at the heart of the problem.

The issue can be succinctly simplified as a TypeError caused by unsupported operand types for multiplying a 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType', ultimately resulting in a failure when attempting to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series, specifically during the multiplication operation.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the issue lies with the multiplication operation being applied to the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. The `right` Series contains NaT (Not a Time) values, which are specific to time-based data in pandas.

The error seems to be caused by the fact that the DataFrame `left` is trying to perform element-wise multiplication with the Series `right`, resulting in the incorrect values of 'NaT' being produced in the resulting ndarray. This type of operation is not appropriate for timedelta data and is causing the discrepancy in the test cases.

To address the issue, you would need to check the logic of the function to ensure that the correct operation is being applied, taking into account the specific non-numeric nature of the `right` Series. This may involve updating the logic to handle the presence of NaT values appropriately, such as through filtering or applying a different operation that is suitable for timedelta data.


# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
right, value: `0   NaT
1   NaT
dtype: timedelta64[ns]`, type: `Series`

func, value: `<built-in function mul>`, type: `builtin_function_or_method`

left, value: `   0  1
0  1  2
1  3  4`, type: `DataFrame`

axis, value: `'columns'`, type: `str`

right.index, value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

left.columns, value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

left.index, value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
a, expected value: `   0  1
0  1  2
1  3  4`, type: `DataFrame`

b, expected value: `0   NaT
1   NaT
dtype: timedelta64[ns]`, type: `Series`

a.columns, expected value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

expressions, expected value: `<module 'pandas.core.computation.expressions' from '/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_145/pandas/core/computation/expressions.py'>`, type: `module`
