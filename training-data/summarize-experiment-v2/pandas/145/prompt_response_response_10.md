The issue is likely occurring because the function is attempting to perform a multiplication operation on a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values, which leads to an unsupported operand type error. The error message suggests that the multiplication operation is being performed between a numpy array and a NaTtype, which is not supported.

To fix this issue, the function `dispatch_to_series` needs to handle the case where the right input is a Series with NaT values. This can be achieved by checking for the presence of NaT values in the Series and applying the operation accordingly.

One approach for fixing the bug would be to modify the section of the code that handles the case where the right input is an instance of `ABCSeries`. Specifically, we can check for the presence of NaT values in the Series and adjust the operation accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that should address the issue:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.isna().any():
            # Handle the case where the Series contains NaT values
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            # Handle other cases where the Series does not contain NaT values
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now properly handle the case where the right input is a Series containing NaT values and perform the operation accordingly. This should address the unsupported operand type error when performing the multiplication operation and allow the failing test to pass.
