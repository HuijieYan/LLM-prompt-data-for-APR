The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of different input types for the `right` parameter and the column-wise operation and evaluation using `expressions.evaluate`.

The bug likely occurs in the logic for handling different input types in the `column_op` functions, as well as in the processing of the `right` parameter before it is used in the `column_op` functions and passed to `expressions.evaluate`.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different input types in the `column_op` functions needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure correct operations and transformations. Additionally, the processing of the `right` parameter before it is used in the `column_op` functions and passed to `expressions.evaluate` should be checked to ensure it matches the expected behavior.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `column_op` functions handle the different input types correctly and consistently, and that the `right` parameter is properly transformed or processed before being used in the `column_op` functions and passed to `expressions.evaluate`. Additionally, the related tests should be reviewed to ensure they cover the different input types and operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: func(a, b), str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: func(a, b), str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: func(a, b), str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: func(a, b), str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected function ensures that the `right` parameter is properly passed to `expressions.evaluate` based on its type and the value of `axis`. It also simplifies the handling of the `column_op` functions to use a lambda function directly within `expressions.evaluate`.

This corrected function should pass the failing test provided and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
