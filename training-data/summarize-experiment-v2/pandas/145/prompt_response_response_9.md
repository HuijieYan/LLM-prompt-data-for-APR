The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to perform column-wise operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or another DataFrame. However, the code currently fails to handle the case where the scalar or Series being operated with contains NaT values.

Based on the provided information, the bug seems to originate from the failure to handle the `NaT` values in the right input correctly. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication, involving a `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`. This implies that the code is not handling the NaT values properly during the operation.

To fix this bug, the code within the function needs to be modified to properly handle scenarios where the right input contains NaT values. This could involve special handling for such cases, ensuring that the NaT values are managed appropriately during the operation to avoid unsupported operand types.

A possible fix for the bug could involve adding conditional checks within the function to explicitly handle cases where the right input contains NaT values. This could involve converting the NaT values to a compatible type before performing the operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        # Handle the case where the right input is a Series with NaT values
        na_values = right.fillna(pd.Timedelta('0 days'))
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        right = na_values

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, a conditional block is added to handle the specific case where the right input is a Series with NaT values. Within this block, the NaT values are filled with `pd.Timedelta('0 days')` to ensure compatibility with the operation, and the operation is then performed.

This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test and ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the right input contains NaT values.
