The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate the frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes input parameters such as `left`, `right`, `func`, `str_rep`, and `axis`. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` attempts to perform an operation using the `multiply` operator with a DataFrame and a Series where the series contains NaT values. This leads to the error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'".

From the provided runtime and expected values, it is evident that the issue lies in the handling of the operands and their types when performing the operation. The function is not correctly handling the case where the right input is a Series containing NaT values.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function to handle the case where the right input is a Series containing NaT values. This may require specific handling of the NaT values and appropriate type checks.
2. Ensure that the operation is performed correctly for each column of the DataFrame, taking into account the type of the right input (scalar, DataFrame, or Series).

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), args=(right.columns,))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the different cases of the right input are handled using the `apply` method to perform the operation on each column of the DataFrame. This ensures that the operation is correctly handled based on the type of the right input. This approach should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
