The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `right` and `a` variables, leading to a TypeError when the function attempts to perform the operation using the column-wise operation specified by the `func` parameter.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to review and potentially revise the logic for handling the column-wise operation and the evaluation using `expressions.evaluate`. Additionally, the handling of different input types for the `right` parameter should be re-examined to ensure proper dispatching and operation.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `right` and `a` variables have the correct values and types before the return statement, and that the operation specified by the `func` parameter is applied correctly to the input data.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar 'right' input
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Handle DataFrame 'right' input
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

By applying the `func` directly to the columns of the `left` DataFrame and the corresponding columns of the `right` input (if applicable), the corrected function should correctly handle the column-wise operation and return a new DataFrame with the expected result.

Note: The suggested fix assumes that the relevant functions `lib.item_from_zerodim` and `lib.is_scalar` handle the transformation and validation of the `right` input correctly. If these functions also contain bugs or inconsistencies, they would need to be addressed separately.
