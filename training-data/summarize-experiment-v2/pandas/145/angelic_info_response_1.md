The given expected case 1 includes input parameters and their types, along with the expected value and type of relevant variables right before the buggy function's return.

The function is expected to perform a column-wise operation on the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. It should evaluate the operation for each column and return a new DataFrame with the result.

The variables and their types are expected to be:
- a: DataFrame with the same values as the input `left`
- b: Series with the same values as the input `right`
- a.columns: RangeIndex with the same values as the columns in `left`
- expressions: Module object representing the pandas.core.computation.expressions module

The buggy function should ensure that the expected variables have the correct values and types before the return statement in order to satisfy the expected case.
