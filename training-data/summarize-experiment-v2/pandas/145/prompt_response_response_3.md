Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different input types for the right parameter and the logic for performing the column-wise operation and evaluation using expressions.evaluate.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of the right parameter and the column-wise operation, leading to the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the correct transformations and operations are applied to the input data within the column-wise operation.
2. Reviewing and potentially revising the logic for handling different input types for the right parameter to ensure proper dispatching and operation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, the handling of different input types for the right parameter has been revised to ensure proper dispatching and operation. The column-wise operation has also been adapted to apply the func operation to each column and return a new DataFrame with the result. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
