The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to arise from the handling of NaT (Not-a-Time) values in the `right` parameter. The code does not handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values properly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be updated to handle the case when `right` is a Series with NaT values. Additionally, the check for `NaN` and `NaT` values should be added to handle such cases properly.

Here are the suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when `right` is a Series with NaT values. This will involve checking for NaT values and performing the operation accordingly.
2. Add a check for `NaN` and `NaT` values in the `dispatch_to_series` function before performing the operation.

Based on the expected input/output variable information and the failing test, the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function should be as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # existing code

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, (pd.NaT, pd.NaT)):
                # Handle NaT values
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    # other conditions and code remain unchanged
```

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should handle the `right` parameter containing NaT values correctly and pass the failing test.
