Based on the error message received from running the test, the root cause of the failure seems to be related to the `mul` operation (multiplication) between a DataFrame and a Series. The error originates from the built-in function `mul` being unable to process the operation due to unsupported operand types. The presence of the `NaTType` is at the heart of the problem.

The issue can be succinctly simplified as a TypeError caused by unsupported operand types for multiplying a 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType', ultimately resulting in a failure when attempting to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series, specifically during the multiplication operation.
