From the error message provided from the failing test code, the TypeError is raised in the `safe_cast` method. `safe_cast` is expected to safely cast a values array to a specified data type by using the `values.astype()` method, and the error message indicates that the array cannot be cast from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` according to the rule 'safe'.

To resolve the issue, the input data needs to be inspected. Additionally, the safe casting function should be analyzed to identify why it's returning the error. This may involve reassessing the logic for casting the values from float to int and potentially modifying the `safe_cast` method and the input data to handle the conversion correctly.
