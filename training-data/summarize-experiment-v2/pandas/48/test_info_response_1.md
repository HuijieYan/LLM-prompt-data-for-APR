The original error message tells us there is a TypeError while casting an array and that this exception occurred at pandas/core/ arrays/integer.py:156. This error was caused by the aggregate operation median (or mean), and the error occurred at pandas/core/groupby/generic.py:994 line, which called the _cython_agg_blocks at line 1083, and the _from_sequence method at line 361 in pandas/core/arrays/integer.py. The function _from_sequence calls the coerce_to_array at line 144. The TypeError occurred at line 261 in the method coerce_to_array, which calls the method safe_cast and the error is raised at line 163 of safe_cast. The test file that called the failing method was `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py`.

The key error is the TypeError while casting the values, and the message is "cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64". The problem was caused by calling the median (or mean) aggregation on 'b' dataframe values.

This error comes from the pandas library, as shown by file paths like `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` and the failing test file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py` that import pandas.

Note: The error message was repeated multiple times with slight differences in the traceback, but the core information provided is the same.
