The error messages are due to the "TypeError" generated by the "safe_cast" function caused by a failed attempt to cast array values from "float64" to "int64" according to the rule 'safe'.

The source of the issue originates from making use of an incompatible data type for the array being operated upon. This occurs when a conversion from "float64" to "int64" is encountered.

The relevant stack frame messages are as follows:
1. pandas/core/arrays/integer.py:156: in safe_cast - It indicates the TypeError generated due to the reasons mentioned above.
2. pandas/core/groupby/generic.py:994 and 1083: in _cython_agg_general and _cython_agg_blocks - They demonstrate where the error occurs.

Simplified version of the error:
The error occurs because the function is trying to cast array values from "float64" to "int64", which is not permissible according to the rule 'safe'.

Action needed:
The function should be checked to ensure that it handles the data types correctly, and the conversion is safe.
