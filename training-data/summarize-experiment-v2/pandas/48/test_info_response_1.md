The method `safe_cast` is trying to cast the values to the dtype, and it is having an error due to incompatible data type. 

The direct cause of the exception is a TypeError: "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'". 

The issue is directly caused by the failing test case initial data with key `values`. The source of this is from the `values` parameter passed to the test function.

The most relevant stack frame messages for finding the fault location come from the `safe_cast` method and from the test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` where the error originated.
