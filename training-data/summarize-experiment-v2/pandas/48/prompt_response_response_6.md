Based on the provided information and the failing test, it seems that the bug is occurring when trying to cast the values from a float to an integer, specifically when using the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message indicates that the array cannot be cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'. This issue is occurring explicitly with the nullable integer data type.

The problematic function seems to be `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. When trying to cast the result to the original dtype, it is encountering issues with the new nullable integer data type. It is also attempting to cast the block back to the original dtype, but it is not handling the nullable integer dtype correctly.

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to inspect the logic for casting the values from float to int, and to analyze the `safe_cast` method to identify why it's encountering the error when dealing with nullable integer data type. This will likely involve modifying the `safe_cast` method and the logic for handling nullable integer data type.

Additionally, the failing test provided shows the input data and the expected output, which can be used to validate the fix.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Modify the logic for casting the values from float to int to handle nullable integer dtype correctly

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Previous logic remains unchanged

        if result is not no_result:
            # Handle the nullable integer dtype appropriately
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)
            else:
                # Handle other cases where the block dtype is not integer
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Remaining logic unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This corrected code includes a modification to handle the nullable integer data type when casting values from float to int, ensuring that the logic is able to handle the specific requirements of the nullable integer data type.

By making this change, the function should be able to handle the new nullable integer data type correctly and pass the failing test.
