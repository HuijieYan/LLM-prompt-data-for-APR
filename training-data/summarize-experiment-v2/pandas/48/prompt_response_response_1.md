It appears that the bug is related to the new nullable integer data type, and calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError. The problem occurs when calling certain aggregation functions (such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`) on nullable integer data.

The bug seems to be related to the safe casting from float to int within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The input data, which includes nullable integer values, causes issues during the safe casting process.

The bug seems to be occurring when the function is trying to handle the nullable integer data and perform aggregation operations on it, leading to the TypeError.

To resolve the bug, it is necessary to modify the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the area where safe casting from float to int is being performed. Additionally, the function should be changed to handle nullable integer data correctly during aggregation operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the safe casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data properly.
2. Adding a check in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to identify nullable integer data and handle it separately during aggregation operations.
3. Ensuring that the safe casting from float to int within the function is compatible with nullable integer data.

Updated code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Check if the block contains nullable integer data
        if isinstance(block.values, pandas.Series) and block.values.dtype == 'Int64':
            # Handle the nullable integer data separately
            result = block.values.astype('float64').mean()
            result = result.astype('Int64')

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the above changes, the safe casting process has been modified to handle nullable integer data separately and prevent the TypeError. This updated logic should ensure that the function is compatible with nullable integer data and can perform aggregation operations correctly.
