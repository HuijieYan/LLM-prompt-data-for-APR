Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug might be related to the conversion of the nullable integer data type when calling mean, median, or std after grouping. The error message indicates a TypeError related to casting non-equivalent float64 to int64, which implies a type conversion issue. It's also noted that the error occurs with median and std, but not with min, max, or first.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the type conversion of the nullable integer data type is handled correctly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and std.

Here's the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation based on the specified 'how' parameter
        agg_result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, self.axis, min_count)
        
        if agg_result is not None:
            # Create a new Block based on the aggregation result
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(agg_result.values)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reorder the items and adjust for deleted items
    agg_blocks, agg_items = self._reorder_items_and_adjust_deleted(data, agg_blocks, new_items)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

# Updated method for performing aggregation on a single block
def _aggregate_block(self, block: Block, how: str, alt, axis, min_count):
    try:
        # Perform aggregation using the grouper's aggregate method
        agg_result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        return agg_result
    except NotImplementedError:
        if alt is not None:
            # Handle alternative aggregation method
            result = self._handle_alternative_aggregation(block, alt)
            return result
        else:
            return None

# Method to handle alternative aggregation
def _handle_alternative_aggregation(self, block, alt):
    obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs].droplevel(0)
    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
    # Unwrap DataFrame to get array
    return result._data.blocks[0].values
```

In this corrected version, we've refactored the logic to handle the aggregation in a more modular and understandable way. Additionally, we've included a method to handle alternative aggregation methods in case the primary aggregation method is not implemented.

This corrected code should address the type conversion issue that was causing the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype.

Assuming this corrected version of the function is integrated into the pandas codebase, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
