The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class to aggregate data using different aggregation methods. It seems that there is an issue with safe casting values from `float64` to `int64` when performing the mean aggregation on grouped data.

The error is related to the safe casting of values within the function, which is causing a TypeError when trying to cast a float to an integer. The issue is occurring when the mean aggregation is applied to the grouped DataFrame containing nullable integer (Int64) values.

The DataFrame is created with nullable integer values, and when the mean function is applied to the grouped data, the safe casting method is attempting to cast a float result to an integer, which is not possible. This is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the safe casting logic needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data appropriately. The safe casting method should return the input data without casting it to a specific type when dealing with nullable integer values. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when casting the mean of a grouped DataFrame with nullable integer values.

The updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle nullable integer data and avoid performing unsafe casts.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            # new logic to handle casting for nullable integer
            if is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
                result = block.dtype.type(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # existing code...

    # existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the new logic added to handle the safe casting of aggregated results for nullable integer (Int64) data, the function should be able to handle mean aggregation on grouped DataFrame containing nullable integer values without raising a TypeError.

This update should resolve the type conversion issue and ensure that the function works correctly for nullable integer data, passing the failing test and fixing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
