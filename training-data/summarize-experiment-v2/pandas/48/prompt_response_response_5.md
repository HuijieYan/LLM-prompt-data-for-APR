Based on the analysis of the buggy function and related information, it seems that the issue is related to the casting of values when using the mean, median, or var aggregation on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message "cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64" indicates a type casting issue.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to improve the type casting logic and ensure consistency in handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/generic.py

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype.kind in 'ui':
                result = np.nanmean(result)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                # reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype.kind in 'ui':
                    result = np.nanmean(result)
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        # rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, additional checks have been added to handle nullable integer data types and cast them appropriately during aggregation operations to avoid the type casting issue that caused the TypeError.

By incorporating these changes, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
