Based on the analysis provided, it seems that the bug is related to the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. This issue occurs at line 994 of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The error message indicates a problem with safely casting non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To address this bug, the following approach can be taken:

1. Check the logic and type handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the aggregation of Int64 dtype is handled correctly.
2. Verify if the aggregation method (such as mean, median, var) is compatible with the nullable integer data type.
3. Ensure that any type casting or conversion operations are performed accurately, considering the nullable nature of the Int64 dtype.

The corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which addresses the described issue, is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code to handle split blocks and index offset

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

Please note that the details of split blocks and index adjustment have been omitted for brevity. The main change is to directly use the `grouper.aggregate` method and handle the resulting `agg_block` without performing any additional type casting or unnecessary operations.

This corrected function should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype while also aligning with the provided GitHub issue.
