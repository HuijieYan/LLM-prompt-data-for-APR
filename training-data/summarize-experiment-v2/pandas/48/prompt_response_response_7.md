The bug is causing a TypeError when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The actual error is occurring in the safe_cast method, where the array cannot be safely cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64'). The issue is related to using the new nullable integer data type and is present in pandas version 1.0.1.

The buggy function is _cython_agg_blocks in the DataFrameGroupBy class in the file pandas/core/groupby/generic.py. The function is responsible for performing aggregation within a groupby operation.

The failing test is attempting to apply the mean, median, and var functions to nullable integer values, and it's failing due to the mentioned TypeError. The corresponding error message indicates that the safe casting method is unable to convert the values from float to int according to the rule 'safe'.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the safe_cast method not handling the nullable integer data type correctly when trying to convert float values to int.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the safe_cast method to handle the conversion of float values to int for nullable integer data type appropriately.
2. Ensure that the _cython_agg_blocks function handles the nullable integer data type consistently during aggregation.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    if result.dtype == 'float64' and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 2 and is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
        result = result.astype('Int64')

    # Existing code...
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to convert the result to the 'Int64' dtype if it is a float array with two dimensions and the block's dtype is of integer type.

This fix should address the issue by ensuring that the conversion from float to int for nullable integer data types is handled appropriately within the aggregation process.
