The issue in the provided code is related to the dtype of the data. When calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, it results in a TypeError. This error occurs with other functions like median and std as well.

The issue seems to stem from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, and the issue is triggered by the function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` in the test file.

The failing test case is trying to cast the values to a specific dtype, but encounters an error due to incompatible data types.

Using the information provided, it seems that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is not handling the aggregation operations on nullable integer data types correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        values = block.values

        if pd.api.types.is_extension_array_dtype(block.dtype) and not pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(block.dtype):
            values = values.astype(np.float64)

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this implementation, the function can correctly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var.

This corrected version should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
