Based on the provided information, we can simplify the runtime input and output value pairs to the following:

### Case 1
- Input: 
  - numeric_only: `True`
  - how: `'mean'`
  - min_count: `-1`
  - self.obj: DataFrame (omitted)
  - self.axis: `0`
- Output:
  - result: `array([[1.5, 1.5, 1.5]])`
  - block.values: `<IntegerArray>[1, <NA>, 2, 1, <NA>, 2, 1, <NA>, 2]`
  
### Case 2
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 3
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 4
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 5
- Input:
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'median'`
- Output:
  - Same as Case 1
  
### Case 6
- Input:
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'median'`
- Output:
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 7
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'median'`
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 8
- Input:
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'median'`
- Output:
  - Same as Case 1

### Case 9
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'var'`
- Output: 
  - result: `array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]])`
  - block.values: `<IntegerArray>[1, <NA>, 2, 1, <NA>, 2, 1, <NA>, 2]`

### Case 10
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'var'`
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 9

### Case 11
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'var'`
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 9

### Case 12
- Input: 
  - Same as Case 1, how changed to `'var'`
- Output: 
  - Same as Case 9

This simplified version captures the essential input parameters and relevant output variables for each case, making it easier to analyze and identify patterns in the buggy function.
