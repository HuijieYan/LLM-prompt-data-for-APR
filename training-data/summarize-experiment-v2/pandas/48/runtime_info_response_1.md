The runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function have been logged for each test case. Upon comparing the outputs with the expected results, it appears that the values of the 'result' variable are consistent across all test cases, indicating that the bug might not lie in the calculation of the result. Other variables such as 'agg_blocks', 'new_items', and 'block.values' also appear consistent.

However, the 'result' variable itself is not incorrect, and the bug likely resides in the comparison of the buggy function's output with the expected result in the test cases. It might be worthwhile to revisit the test cases and ensure that the expected result is accurate, as the runtime values of the variables in the buggy function do not point to any specific discrepancy.

Further investigation into the test cases and their expected results is necessary to identify and fix the bug accurately.
