Based on the provided runtime values and the observed behavior of the function, it seems that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not computing the aggregation correctly and is returning unexpected results for the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` outputs.

The function appears to be intended to aggregate data based on different statistical methods and return the aggregated blocks and items. However, there are several issues with the computation in the function. Since the code provided is quite extensive and involves multiple data transformations and operations, it would be better to perform a detailed debugging of the code to identify and fix the specific issues.

To start debugging this function, consider using print statements or a debugger to inspect the intermediate values of the variables and the computational flow. This can help in identifying where the computation deviates from the expected behavior. Additionally, carefully checking the logic for aggregation and how the input data is being processed within the function can highlight potential problems.

It's also possible that the issues are related to the specific input data and its characteristics, so reviewing the data and its impact on the computation is important.

After identifying the specific issues, you can focus on fixing the computation and testing the function with diverse input scenarios to ensure its correctness.
