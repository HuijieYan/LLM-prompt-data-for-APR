The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It is used to aggregate data using various functions like mean, median, var, etc. The `TypeError` arises when using the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype data.

The potential error location within the function is the safe_cast method, which is responsible for safely casting a values array to a specified data type. It appears that the safe casting function is not handling the conversion from float to int correctly when dealing with nullable integer data types.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the safe_cast method not handling the nullable integer data type conversion correctly, especially when dealing with aggregations that result in float values (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) from a DataFrameGroupBy object.

To fix this bug, the safe_cast method needs to be modified to handle the conversion from float to int correctly, particularly when working with nullable integer data types.

Here is a possible fix for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle NotImplementedError
        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == 'Int64Dtype':
                # check if the block has 'Int64Dtype'
                if how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
                    # handle safe_cast for nullable int
                    result = result.astype('Int64')
            # create agg_block
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This fix modifies the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to explicitly handle the safe casting for nullable integer data types when performing aggregations that result in float values. This should resolve the `TypeError` raised when using the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype data.

The modified code should be tested with the failing test provided to ensure that it passes and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
