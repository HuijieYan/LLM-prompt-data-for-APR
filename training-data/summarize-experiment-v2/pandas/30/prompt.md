Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import iNaT
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Series, isna, to_datetime

    def test_readjson_bool_series(self):

        expected = pd.Series([True, True, False])
        tm.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `_get_object_parser` function within `_json.py` file, specifically during the `read_json` process in the `test_pandas.py` file.

Simplified error message from the command line is:
```
TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime in tslib.pyx
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The main discrepancy in both cases lies in the variables `in_range` and `date_unit`. In Case 1, `in_range` is showing all `False` values when it should have some `True` values based on the input data. In Case 2, `date_unit` is showing as `'ns'` when it should be derived from `self._STAMP_UNITS` tuple.

The reason for this discrepancy could be a logic error in the code that is responsible for calculating the `in_range` values and selecting the appropriate `date_unit`. The code might not be correctly handling the input data or could be referencing the wrong variables. 

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic responsible for calculating these variables, ensuring that the correct data is being used and the correct conditions are being applied. Additionally, the code for selecting the `date_unit` should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly referencing the `self._STAMP_UNITS` tuple.


# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
data, value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

self.min_stamp, value: `31536000`, type: `int`

self._STAMP_UNITS, value: `('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')`, type: `tuple`

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
new_data, expected value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

new_data.dtype, expected value: `dtype('int64')`, type: `dtype`

in_range, expected value: `array([False, False, False])`, type: `ndarray`

new_data._values, expected value: `array([0, 1, 2])`, type: `ndarray`

## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Title: read_json with typ="series" results in timestamps/Exception

Description:
When using pd.read_json with typ="series" to convert a JSON list of bools, it results in a Pandas Series object with timestamps in older Pandas versions and raises a TypeError in version 1.0.0. This is inconsistent with the "frame" case and users would expect a Series of bools. This issue does not occur when convert_dates is set to False. The expected output is a Pandas Series of boolean values.

2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class docs
   (c). The failing test
   (d). The corresponding error message
   (e). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value
   (f). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value
   (g). The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
