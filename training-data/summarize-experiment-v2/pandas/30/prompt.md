Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import iNaT
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Series, isna, to_datetime

        tm.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error message is raised at the following line in the buggy function `pandas/io/json/_json.py`:

```python
new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
```

The error message indicates that `<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`. This error message is related to the attempt to convert boolean data to datetime.

Simplified error message:
`<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`

Hope this helps.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The `_try_convert_to_date` function is designed to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. It tries to coerce objects in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch formats and return a boolean if parsing was successful. However, there are several issues in the code that need to be addressed.

In the first failing case, the input data is a RangeIndex, and the function attempts to change the data type to "int64" without handling the case of non-numeric data. As a result, the function does not successfully parse the data into a date column and returns the original data with a False flag.

In the second failing case, the input data is a Series of boolean values, and the function attempts to convert the data type to "int64" without considering the nature of boolean values. Additionally, the date parsing loop does not properly handle the given date unit ("ns") and the nature of the data, resulting in a failed conversion.

To fix these issues, the function should include proper handling for non-numeric and boolean data types, as well as ensure that the date parsing loop covers all possible date units and correctly handles the input data type. Additionally, error handling for specific data types and conversions should be implemented to improve the reliability of the function.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In this case, the expected output is to convert the data into a date format. However, the function is not working properly and needs to be fixed. The input parameters and types are provided, along with the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. The expected values include the expected value of new_data, new_data.dtype, in_range, and new_data._values. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases to ensure that the conversion to date format is handled correctly.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Calling mean() on DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype raises a TypeError

Description:
When calling mean() after grouping resulting in a TypeError with nullable integer data type Int64. The error also occurs with median() and std() methods, but not with min(), max(), or first(). The expected output should compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of grouped data without raising any TypeError.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, the expected input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class docs
