The main discrepancy in both cases lies in the variables `in_range` and `date_unit`. In Case 1, `in_range` is showing all `False` values when it should have some `True` values based on the input data. In Case 2, `date_unit` is showing as `'ns'` when it should be derived from `self._STAMP_UNITS` tuple.

The reason for this discrepancy could be a logic error in the code that is responsible for calculating the `in_range` values and selecting the appropriate `date_unit`. The code might not be correctly handling the input data or could be referencing the wrong variables. 

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic responsible for calculating these variables, ensuring that the correct data is being used and the correct conditions are being applied. Additionally, the code for selecting the `date_unit` should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly referencing the `self._STAMP_UNITS` tuple.
