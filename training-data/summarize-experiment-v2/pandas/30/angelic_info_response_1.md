In this case, the expected output is to convert the data into a date format. However, the function is not working properly and needs to be fixed. The input parameters and types are provided, along with the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. The expected values include the expected value of new_data, new_data.dtype, in_range, and new_data._values. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases to ensure that the conversion to date format is handled correctly.
