The potential error location within the function is identified as the block of code that tries to parse a boolean value into a datetime. This conversion is not valid and results in the TypeError.

The bug is caused by the function `_try_convert_to_date` attempting to convert boolean values into datetimes, which is not a valid conversion. This leads to a TypeError being raised, as observed in the failing test. The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is due to the incorrect conversion attempted by the function.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle boolean values differently and not try to convert them into datetimes. This will eliminate the TypeError and ensure that boolean values are correctly processed.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_try_convert_to_date` is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # Handle boolean values differently
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By handling boolean values differently and not attempting to convert them into datetimes, the updated function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
