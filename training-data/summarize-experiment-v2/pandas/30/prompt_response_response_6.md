The bug is originating from the `_try_convert_to_date` method in the `_json.py` file, where it attempts to convert a boolean value into a datetime, resulting in a TypeError. The issue on GitHub describes the problem as `read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools resulting in timestamps/Exception, which is inconsistent with the "frame" case and raises a TypeError since version 1.0.0.

The problem stems from the function attempting to convert boolean values into datetime, which is not a valid conversion. The expected output is a Pandas Series of bools, but the function is returning a series of timestamps or raising an exception.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` method to handle boolean values differently. We can check for the dtype of the input data, and if it's a boolean, we can directly return the data as it is without attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle boolean values and return the expected output for the failing test case. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue raised by ensuring that the `read_json` method with `typ="series"` returns the expected Pandas Series of bools.
