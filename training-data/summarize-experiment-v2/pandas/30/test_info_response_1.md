The failing test is trying to convert a boolean array into datetime using the `read_json` method from the `_json.py` file. However, the data conversion to datetime fails, and an error is raised.

The core problem seems to be originating from the `_try_convert_to_date` method in the `_json.py` file. The function specifically tries to convert a boolean value into a datetime, which is creating the error.

The error message can be simplified to:

```
TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime
```
