The failing test encountered a 'TypeError' at line 1665 in the file 'pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py'. The error is caused by the line `result = read_json("[true, true, false]", typ="series")`, which caused the call stack to execute methods that eventually led to calling `to_datetime` and attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime object. The detailed error message is "TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime".

The issue originates from the method `_try_convert_to_date` in the file 'pandas/io/json/_json.py', particularly at line 984, where it attempts to convert boolean values to datetime. However, boolean values are not convertible to datetime, leading to the error.
