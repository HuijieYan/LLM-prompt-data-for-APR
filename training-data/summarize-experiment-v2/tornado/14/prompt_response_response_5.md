The potential error in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is that the `make_current` argument is not being properly handled. If `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. 

To fix this, we need to modify the conditional statement handling the `make_current` argument. Here's the updated and corrected `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this updated code, the `initialize` method checks if `make_current` is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making it current.

This updated code should pass the failing test and effectively resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
