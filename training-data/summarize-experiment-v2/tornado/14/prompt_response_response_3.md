Based on the provided information, the bug in the initialize function of the IOLoop class is that it is not handling the make_current argument correctly. The current logic first checks if make_current is None, and if so, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then calls self.make_current(). Next, it checks if make_current is True, and if so, it again checks if current IOLoop instance is None and raises a RuntimeError if it is not None. 

From the failing test and the error message, it seems that the bug is related to the logic for handling the make_current argument. The failing test is expecting a RuntimeError to be raised when trying to create a new IOLoop with make_current=True if there is already a current instance, but it is not happening as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling make_current argument is not correctly differentiating between the cases when a current IOLoop instance already exists and when it doesn't.

To fix the bug, the logic in the initialize function needs to be adjusted to properly handle the make_current argument. It should check if make_current is True and if there is already a current IOLoop instance, then raise a RuntimeError. If make_current is None, it should behave as it does currently.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function should now handle the make_current argument as expected and pass the failing test case. This will also resolve the GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None".
