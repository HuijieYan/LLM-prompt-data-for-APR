The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. The function should raise an error in this case, but it is not doing so correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. Specifically, we need to check if `make_current` is True and if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
