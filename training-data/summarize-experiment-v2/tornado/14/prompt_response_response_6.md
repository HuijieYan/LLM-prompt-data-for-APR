The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The error message "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists" is raised when the `make_current` parameter is set to True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional block for the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, we should raise the `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is None, we should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then make it the current instance. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The changes made include updating the condition for `if make_current` to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None and raising the `RuntimeError` accordingly. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
