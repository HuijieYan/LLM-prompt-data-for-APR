### Bug Location
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement checking for the existence of the current IOLoop. 

### Bug Cause
The `initialize` method is meant to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current=True`, it should set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop. However, in the conditional statement, the logic seems to be checking if the current IOLoop is already present when it should check if it's not present.

### Possible Approaches
To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be changed to check if the current IOLoop is not present when `make_current=True`. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current=None` case should also be updated to set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop when there is no current instance.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # Set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed. The failing test should now pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
