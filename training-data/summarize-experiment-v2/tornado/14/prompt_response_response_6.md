The issue in the initialize function is that the logic for handling the make_current parameter is incorrect. Instead of checking if there is no current IOLoop instance and then calling self.make_current(), the function should directly call self.make_current() if make_current is True, and should raise a RuntimeError only if make_current is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the initialize function to properly handle the make_current parameter and the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The changes made in the corrected version include:
- Adjusting the condition in the elif statement to check if make_current is True, rather than just a non-None value.
- Checking if the current IOLoop instance is not None before raising a RuntimeError when make_current is True.

With these changes, the corrected function should properly handle the make_current parameter and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
