The issue in the buggy function is that it checks if the current IOLoop exists before calling the make_current function, but if make_current is set to True, it still checks for the current IOLoop, and if it exists, it raises a RuntimeError. This contradicts the intended behavior when make_current is set to True.

To fix this issue, we should remove the check for the current IOLoop if make_current is set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function will only call make_current if make_current is True, without checking for the current IOLoop.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
