The issue with the initialize function is that the logic is flawed and does not handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created properly. 

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the initialize function to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

The corrected initialize function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This fix addresses the flawed logic in the original initialize function by checking for the presence or absence of a current IOLoop instance depending on the value of make_current, and only raising a RuntimeError when necessary.

With this corrected function, the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass successfully and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.

The GitHub issue title:
```
Fix logic in initialize function to properly handle existing or new IOLoop instances
```

The GitHub issue's detailed description:
```
The logic in the initialize function needs to be revised to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created. This fix ensures that the initialize function behaves as expected depending on the value of make_current.
