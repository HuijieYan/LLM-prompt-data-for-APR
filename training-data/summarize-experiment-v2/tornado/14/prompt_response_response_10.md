```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
The issue can be resolved by fixing the if condition in the `initialize` function. The error was occurring because the condition inside the if statement was incorrect. By changing the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, we ensure that the error is only raised when there is already a current instance.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
