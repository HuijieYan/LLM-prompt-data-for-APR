    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.

    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.

```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The provided error message is a stack trace.
- The failing test function `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
- The stack trace shows that the until that raises the exception is inside the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file, and more specifically, it indicates that the exception is being raised in `tornado/ioloop.py` at line 253.
- The original error message is: `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

Simplified error message:
```
Error: current IOLoop already exists
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the given code, the initialize function is meant to initialize the IOLoop object by setting it as the current IOLoop. However, there are some issues with the logic of the function.

In the case where make_current is None, the function checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then calls self.make_current(). However, this logic is flawed because it does not make sense to create a new IOLoop instance if one does not exist when make_current is None.

Similarly, in the case where make_current is True, the function checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then raises a RuntimeError if that is the case. This logic is also flawed because it should not raise an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic in the initialize function should be revised to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
line 252, IOLoop.current(instance=False) is Noneã€‚why then raise "already exists"?
