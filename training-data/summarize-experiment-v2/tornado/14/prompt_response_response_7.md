The potential error location within the buggy function is at the conditional statement `if make_current is None:`. 
Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not evaluating as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the logic is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. It should raise an error in this case, according to the test and the error message.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
