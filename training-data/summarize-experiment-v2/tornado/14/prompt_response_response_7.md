The issue in the `initialize` function is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is flawed. It should only try to make the IOLoop instance current if `make_current` is True, and it should raise an error if `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists.

To fix this issue, we need to revise the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    ... (other class documentation remains the same)
    """

    # Fix for the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:  # if make_current is not specified
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # if current instance does not exist
                self.make_current()  # make the current instance
        elif make_current:  # if make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # if current instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # raise an error
            self.make_current()  # make the current instance

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance needs to be made current or already exists. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
