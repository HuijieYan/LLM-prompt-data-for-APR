The issue lies within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. The function is designed to set the current IOLoop instance, but it has a bug where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

The bug occurs because the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`, but then raises an error if the current IOLoop instance already exists. This is contradictory behavior, as checking for `None` and then raising an error for the existence of an IOLoop are conflicting conditions.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the current IOLoop instance.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this fixed code, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance` and then check if it is `None` or not based on the `make_current` parameter. We only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

With this fix, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
