The potential error within the buggy function `initialize` is in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The current logic does not properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True.

The cause of the bug:
- The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the IOLoop object by setting it as the current IOLoop. However, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is flawed, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter to accurately determine when to make the IOLoop current.
2. Update the conditional statements and make use of the `IOLoop.current()` and `make_current()` functions appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected function should properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True, and it ensures that the IOLoop instance is initialized appropriately.

This updated code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test.
