### Bug Location
The potential error is located in the conditional statement `if make_current:` of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class.

### Bug Cause
The issue is caused by the conditional statement `if make_current:` falsely assuming that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is always `None`. This assumption leads to the premature raising of the "current IOLoop already exists" error.

### Possible Approaches
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the condition for raising the error is accurate. We should check if `make_current` is `True` and if an instance of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` already exists.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current: 
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` ensures that the error is only raised if an instance of the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.

### GitHub Issue
Title: "Condition for raising 'current IOLoop already exists' error in IOLoop.initialize is inaccurate"
Description: The condition for raising the 'current IOLoop already exists' error in the `IOLoop.initialize` function is inaccurate, leading to premature errors. This has been corrected by ensuring that the error is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` already exists.
