Potential error location: The buggy logic in the initialize function of the IOLoop class at line 252 in ioloop.py file is causing the issue.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function, `initialize`, does not properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`. It incorrectly creates a new IOLoop instance or raises a RuntimeError without checking for the current IOLoop instance.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
Revise the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code checks if a current IOLoop instance exists before making any decisions based on the value of `make_current`. It addresses the incorrect logic from the original function and should resolve the issue.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
