## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to a misunderstanding of the make_current parameter in the initialize function. When make_current is set to True, the buggy code checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance using the IOLoop.current(instance=False) function. If it finds that there is already an instance, it raises a RuntimeError. However, in the failing test, make_current is set to True, which triggers the RuntimeError because it detects that there is already a current IOLoop instance, even though this is the expected behavior according to the test.

## Bug location
The bug is located in the conditional statement for make_current in the initialize function of the IOLoop class.

## Possible approaches to fix the bug
1. Change the condition for raising RuntimeError in the initialize function to only raise the error if make_current is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Modify the failing test to account for the correct behavior of the initialize function, or update the behavior of the initialize function to match the failing test's expectation.

## Corrected code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # only raise error if make_current is True and a current instance exists
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: 
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
