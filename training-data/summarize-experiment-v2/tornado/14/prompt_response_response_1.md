Upon analyzing the buggy function `initialize` and its related components, it appears that the issue lies in the flawed logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The function incorrectly attempts to create a new IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `None`, and raises an error when `make_current` is `True` even if an IOLoop instance already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It should only create a new IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance, and not raise an error if an instance already exists.

To address this issue, the `initialize` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter, ensuring that a new IOLoop instance is only created if necessary.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be revised as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and ensures that a new IOLoop instance is only created when necessary.

This corrected version of the `initialize` function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.

GitHub Issue Title:
```
ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None
```

GitHub Issue Description:
```
The logic in line 252 of ioloop.py results in an erroneous RuntimeError being raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists. The logic needs to be updated to address this issue.
```
