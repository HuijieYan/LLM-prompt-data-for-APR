### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if an IOLoop.current instance is already present before calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True and an IOLoop.current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, if `make_current` is None, it calls `self.make_current()` even if an IOLoop.current instance already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` instantiates an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then attempts to instantiate another IOLoop with `make_current=True`. This triggers the `RuntimeError` in the buggy function, indicating that `make_current` is not being properly handled when it is None.

The GitHub issue indicates a discrepancy between the check for a current IOLoop instance and the subsequent raising of the error.

### Bug Cause
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is None and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Possible Approaches
1. Update the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is None and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
2. Modify the check for a current IOLoop instance to be more explicit and account for all the possible scenarios.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected code, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the scenario when `make_current` is None and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the issue and the failing test case.
