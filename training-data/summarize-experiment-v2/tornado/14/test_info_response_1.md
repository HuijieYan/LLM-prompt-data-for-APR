The original error message has multiple stack frames and specific error locations associated with the failing test that can make it confusing to understand for a workaround.

The bug is located in ioloop.py, within the `initialize` method of the IOLoop class and specifically within the `if make_current` conditional block. The error `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is raised when the IOLoop current instance already exists.

A simplified version of the original error message could be:
"Error at line 253 in ioloop.py: RuntimeError - current IOLoop already exists."
