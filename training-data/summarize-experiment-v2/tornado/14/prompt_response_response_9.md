The bug in the `initialize` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. However, the current code is not properly checking for the existence of the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and raise a `RuntimeError` when necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and properly handle the `make_current` parameter, raising a `RuntimeError` when necessary.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version. It resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and should also pass the failing test.
