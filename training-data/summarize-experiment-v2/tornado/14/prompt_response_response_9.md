The issue in the `initialize` function of `tornado/ioloop.py` is that the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. It creates a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is None, and it raises an error if `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists.

To fix this, we need to revise the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where the IOLoop instance already exists or needs to be created.

Potential error location: There are two potential error locations in the `initialize` function. First, the condition `if make_current is None` should not create a new instance of `IOLoop`. Second, the condition `elif make_current` should not raise an error if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The above code fixes the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. It first checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and then acts accordingly based on the value of `make_current`.

This corrected code should resolve the issue specified in the GitHub report and also pass the failing test case.

GitHub Issue:
- Title: `ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None`
- Description: `line 252, IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. why then raise "already exists"?`

This corrected code addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report by fixing the flawed logic in the `initialize` function and should resolve the problem.
