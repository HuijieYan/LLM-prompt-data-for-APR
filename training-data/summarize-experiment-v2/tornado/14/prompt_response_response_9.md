### Bug Cause

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It checks if `IOLoop.current` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`, but it doesn't handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current` is not `None`. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Location

The bug is located in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statements for checking `make_current`.

### Proposed Fix

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to handle the `make_current` parameter more effectively, ensuring that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when appropriate.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class code)

    # Fixing the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the above modification, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` when it's not necessary.

The corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

This fix should address the bug and the GitHub issue.
