The bug in the table_exists function in luigi/contrib/hive.py is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the stdout. The function does not consider case insensitivity, leading to false positives or false negatives in the test results. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a case-insensitive comparison of the table name and the stdout, resolving the issue of false positives or false negatives in the test results.

The GitHub issue for this bug is titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" with the detailed description:
"Check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues"

This fix addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test cases. It ensures that the table_exists function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables.
