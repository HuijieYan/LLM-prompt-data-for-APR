The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it does not account for case sensitivity. The function should perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the stdout. This is causing the failing test cases to return unexpected results, leading to assertion errors.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of the table name to the stdout. The function is not converting the table name to lowercase for comparison, which is causing the case sensitivity issue.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the stdout. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue by making the table_exists function case insensitive.

The GitHub issue title for this bug can be "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The detailed description can mention that the stdout should be checked against the lowercased table name to avoid case sensitivity issues. This approach ensures that table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug.
