The bug in the `table_exists` function has been identified and the correct implementation of the function has been provided. Below is the entire corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

The above code will now correctly check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. It addresses the issues raised in the failing test and also resolves the issue posted in the related GitHub bug.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
