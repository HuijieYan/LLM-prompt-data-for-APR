Potential error location: The issue is likely occurring due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `table_exists` function. This is causing the function to return an unexpected output, leading to test failures.

Bug cause:
- The buggy function is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to false test results.
- The failing tests are asserting `self.assertTrue(returned)`, expecting the function to return `True` in specific cases, but it's failing due to the case sensitivity issue.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected code for the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information provided.

GitHub Issue Information:
- The issue title "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the problem of case sensitivity in table existence checks.
- The detailed description of the issue emphasizes the need for making the comparison case insensitive to avoid test failures when dealing with capitalized table names.
- The proposed solution aligns with the suggested approach for fixing the bug.

By addressing the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected code will align with the expectations outlined in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
