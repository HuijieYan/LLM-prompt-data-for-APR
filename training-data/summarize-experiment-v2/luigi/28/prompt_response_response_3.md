The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function is not taking into account that Hive is case insensitive and returns table names as lowercase. This leads to false positives or false negatives when testing for table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to be case insensitive when comparing table names. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will now correctly compare table names in a case insensitive manner and pass the failing test.

Additionally, a GitHub issue related to this bug can be titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The detailed description for the issue can state:
"Check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues."

This fix will address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the function works as expected in a case insensitive environment.
