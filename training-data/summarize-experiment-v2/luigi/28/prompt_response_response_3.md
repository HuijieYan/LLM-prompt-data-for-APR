## Potential Error Location

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the condition checking where the table name is compared. It seems that the function is not handling case-sensitivity properly, leading to incorrect comparisons and ultimately incorrect return values.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the case-sensitivity of the table names when comparing them with the output from the Hive command. The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons properly, leading to discrepancies in the return values.

## Suggested Fix

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the output from Hive command to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) for comparison. Additionally, the function should address how it handles partitions to ensure correct output values for all test cases.

## Corrected Code

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function handles case-insensitivity by converting both the table name and the output from Hive command to lowercase before comparison. It also properly handles the partition condition. This corrected code is a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.

With these updates, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will address the issue posted in the GitHub discussion regarding case-sensitivity.

This suggested fix and corrected code will resolve the bug and improve the functionality of the `table_exists` function.
