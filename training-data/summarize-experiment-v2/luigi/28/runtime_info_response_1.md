By analyzing the runtime input/output values and comparing them with the core logic of the function, it is evident that the bug in the function is related to the discrepancy in the output for different test cases. Specifically, the output seems to be incorrect when the table name is provided with different cases (lowercase vs uppercase) and also when a partition is included in the input. 

Based on these discrepancies, it can be inferred that the buggy function likely has a case-sensitivity issue with table names and a potential issue with handling partitions. Additionally, there may be a logic error in the function that is leading to incorrect output values. 

To effectively fix the bug, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles case-sensitivity and partitions, and the logic should be corrected to generate the expected output for all test cases.
