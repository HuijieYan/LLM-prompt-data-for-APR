The `table_exists` function is intended to check whether a table or partition exists in a Hive database. However, there are multiple bugs in the function that need to be fixed.

1. In the `if partition is None` block, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. If `stdout` is non-empty, it will always evaluate to `True`, but we need to check if the `table` is present in `stdout`. The correct condition should be `table in stdout`.

2. In the `else` block, the condition `if stdout` is also incorrect. The function should return `True` if the partition exists, which means `stdout` should not be empty. The condition should be `if stdout and table in stdout`.

3. In the `show partitions` command, the function should check if the specified partition exists, but it's currently just checking if the `stdout` is non-empty.

4. Because the case of the table name can vary, the function should be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table or partition. We can convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the check.

To fix these bugs, the correct implementation for the `table_exists` function should be as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```
