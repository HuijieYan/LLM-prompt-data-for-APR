The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case-sensitivity issues with table names and potential problems with handling partitions. Additionally, there may be a logic error that is causing the function to return incorrect values for different test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to check `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name to ensure case insensitivity. Additionally, the logic for handling partitions should be reviewed to ensure correct output values. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
