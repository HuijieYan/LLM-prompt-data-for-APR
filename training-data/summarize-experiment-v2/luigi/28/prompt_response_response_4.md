The issue with the table_exists function is that it is not case insensitive when checking the table names in the stdout. This results in false positives or false negatives when testing the existence of a table.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This should resolve the issue and make the table_exists function case insensitive.

This corrected version of the function is also expected to pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue by making the table_exists function case insensitive.

Once this corrected version of the function is implemented, the failing test should no longer result in the AssertionError: False is not true.
