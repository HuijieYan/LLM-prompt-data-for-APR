The problem seems to be related to the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, which is causing the tests to fail when expecting certain table names.

The failing tests show that the function is not returning the expected values under certain conditions. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case sensitivity of table names, which is causing the mismatch between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the table names in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" already suggests the approach to fix the bug, which is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. This aligns with our analysis of the bug.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle table names in a case-insensitive manner and satisfy the expectations of the failing tests. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub discussion by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

This fix should be accompanied by appropriate testing to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios. Once verified, the fix can be incorporated into the codebase and the GitHub issue can be closed.
