The bug in the `table_exists` function of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the `show tables` Hive command. The function should be case insensitive, but it currently returns inaccurate values.

The cause of the bug has been identified as the function not accounting for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output of the `show tables` command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned from the `show tables` command, making it case insensitive.

This fix will also resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.

With this fix, the function will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The GitHub issue for this bug has been titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and the description suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. This fix addresses that suggestion.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function can now be dropped in as a replacement for the buggy version.
