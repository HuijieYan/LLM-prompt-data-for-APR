The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with case sensitivity. In the failing test cases, the `table_exists` function is expected to return `True` in specific scenarios, but it's returning `False` instead.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and its description discuss the problem, pointing out that Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case, causing issues when comparing table names in code. The suggested fix is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The actual input/output variable information shows that the `stdout` variable is sometimes in lowercase, causing mismatch with the input parameters. The expected input/output variable information suggests that in certain cases, the `stdout` should match the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity. The comparison between `stdout` and the table name should be case insensitive, either by converting both to lowercase before comparison or using a case-insensitive comparison method.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison between `stdout` and the table name is case insensitive, addressing the issue highlighted in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

By applying this change, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity correctly and should pass the failing test cases. Additionally, it resolves the issue raised in the GitHub discussion about case sensitivity when comparing table names.
