Based on the analysis, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to a case sensitivity issue with table names, and a potential issue with handling partitions. Additionally, there may be a logic error in the function that is leading to incorrect output values.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to handle case insensitivity for table names and correctly handle partitions. The logic should be updated to generate the correct output for all test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function now handles case sensitivity for table names by converting both the input table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison. Additionally, it addresses the handling of partitions as per the logic in the original code.

With these changes, the function should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test cases. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub discussion by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Please note that the related functions such as `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are assumed to work correctly and are not modified in this correction.
