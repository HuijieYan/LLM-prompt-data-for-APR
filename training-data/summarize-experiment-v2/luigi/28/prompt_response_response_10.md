Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies with case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling case differences properly, causing the tests to fail when they expect case-insensitive behavior.

To fix this issue, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name with the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. The function should also be updated to handle both uppercase and lowercase table names correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing tests.

The GitHub issue titles and descriptions suggest making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the `stdout` against the lowercase version of the `table` name. The corrected function aligns with this suggestion and should resolve the issue.

It's important to ensure that the function now passes the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided. Once the changes are made, a pull request can be made to address the issue on GitHub.
