The correct implementation for the `table_exists` function should be as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```
With this fix, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive table names and verify the existence of tables or partitions in the hive database.

By using the `lower()` method, it converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the check, ensuring that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table or partition. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug and aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to fix the issues reported.
