The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is comparing the table name with the stdout without considering case, which causes the test cases to fail. The related GitHub issue suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the table name and stdout in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's a possible fix for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function will be case insensitive when checking for table existence. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" reflects this potential change and can be used to track the fix.
