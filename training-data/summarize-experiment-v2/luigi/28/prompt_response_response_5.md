Based on the information provided, the buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing due to a case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive.

The issue is related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive, so the function needs to do a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name to the table names returned in the stdout.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in the stdout, which resolves the case sensitivity issue.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

As for the GitHub issue, the title could be "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive", with the detailed description stating that the stdout should be checked against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive, resolving the bug and addressing the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.

I hope this helps in resolving the bug and implementing the necessary fix. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
