The buggy function 'table_exists' in the hive.py file has a few issues:

1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` in the if block is incorrect. It should be `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to make the check case-insensitive.

2. The condition `if stdout` in the else block is also incorrect. It should be `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to make the check case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function should be updated as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

This updated implementation fixes the case insensitivity issue and should correctly check for the existence of a table or partition in a case-insensitive manner.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and also address the issue raised in the GitHub bug.

Please replace the existing 'table_exists' function in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file with the corrected version provided above.
