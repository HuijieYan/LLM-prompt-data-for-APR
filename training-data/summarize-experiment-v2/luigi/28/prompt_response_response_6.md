Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to a case sensitivity issue with table names and a potential problem with handling partitions. 

To fix the bug, the code should be reviewed to ensure proper handling of case sensitivity and partitions. Additionally, the logic should be corrected to generate the expected output for all test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case sensitivity with table names and correctly handle partitions. The corrected function aligns with the expected input/output variables and should pass all the test cases.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" also suggests the change needed to make the function case insensitive, which has been implemented in the corrected function. This fix also aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue description.

By using the corrected code provided above, the bug related to the case sensitivity issue and handling of partitions in the `table_exists` function should be resolved.
