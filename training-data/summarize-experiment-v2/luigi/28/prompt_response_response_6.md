The bug in the table_exists function of luigi/contrib/hive.py is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the hive command. The function is currently returning false positives or false negatives when testing for table existence. This is because the table name is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for table existence in a case-insensitive way. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

With this fix, the function table_exists will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This addresses the underlying issue reported in the GitHub thread and resolves the bug in the function.
