The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the existence of a table in a database, and it seems to be assuming a case-sensitive match between the provided table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`. However, Hive is case-insensitive, so the comparison should also be case-insensitive to avoid issues.

The failing test cases are checking for the existence of a table, and they fail when the table name is provided in a different case than the one returned by Hive. This indicates that the comparisons in the `table_exists` function are not handling case insensitivity correctly.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" raised by a user named Lin suggests that the issue is indeed related to case insensitivity. The proposed solution is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the comparisons in the `table_exists` function should be made case-insensitive. The corrected code for the function would involve using `lower()` to make both the table name and the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd` lowercase before comparison.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function now makes case-insensitive comparisons, which aligns with Hive's behavior. This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
