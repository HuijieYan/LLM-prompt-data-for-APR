Based on the provided error messages, the assertion fails thereby causing the pytest to fail. The failing tests are intended to check the behavior of the 'table_exists' method. The error messages specify that after accessing the 'table_exists' method, the expected result is True, but instead, the result is False. Also, the initial mock command for 'run_hive_cmd' method is incorrect, which can infer to failing test as well. 

The refactored error message that skips the irrelevant parts would be as follows:
- The tests failed because a call to the 'table_exists' method returned an unexpected result: a False when it was expected to return True.

It leads to the conclusion that the code path taken corresponds to an else branch in the 'table_exists' method in the buggy file. Therefore, the conditional check seems to be faulty. The first troubleshooting step would be to investigate the 'table_exists' method in the buggy file and its else block to identify the root cause of the error.
