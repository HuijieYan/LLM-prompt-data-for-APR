The bug is located in the table_exists function of luigi/contrib/hive.py. When the command 'show tables like "{1}";' is executed, the return stdout value is inaccurate. This leads to either false positives or false negatives when testing the table_exists function. If this test function ran successfully, the return value should be "OK\n" followed by the table names.

Simplified Error Message:
AssertionError: False is not true
