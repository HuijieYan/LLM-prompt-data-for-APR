The error messages shown above are from two different test functions which are failing.

In the first error message, the failing test is test_table_exists at line 111 in the file `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. It asserts `self.assertTrue(returned)` and fails.

In the second error message, the failing test is test_apacheclient_table_exists at line 175 in the file `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. It also asserts `self.assertTrue(returned)` and fails.

The test message is "AssertionError: False is not true", this message indicates that the failure occurred due to an assertion not being met. Both test cases call the function `table_exists` from the source code, which is expected to return `True` in the specific cases and the tests are checking for that.

For the fix:
The `table_exists` function may be returning the wrong output under certain conditions. It seems that there is a logic issue within this function, and it should be debugged to determine why it's returning an unexpected output, causing the test cases to fail.
