After analyzing the buggy function and its related components, it is evident that the issue lies within the comparison of the table name in a case sensitive manner. This leads to discrepancies in the test results. The GitHub issue indicates that the table_exist function should be case insensitive when checking the existence of tables.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exist function to compare the table name in a case insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the table_exist function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected function ensures that the table names are compared in a case insensitive manner, addressing the issue identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
