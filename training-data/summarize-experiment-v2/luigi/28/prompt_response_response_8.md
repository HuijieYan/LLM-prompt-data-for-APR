The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function should be modified to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made to the `table_exists` function:

1. Convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output from the Hive command.
2. Modify the logic to return `True` if the table is found in the output, and `False` if it is not found.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)

# Other functions and test cases remain unchanged
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function will handle case sensitivity issues and return the correct result for all test cases. Additionally, the bug posted on GitHub will be resolved by making the table existence check case insensitive.
