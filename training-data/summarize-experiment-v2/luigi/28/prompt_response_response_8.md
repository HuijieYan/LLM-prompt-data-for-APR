The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the failing test cases due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is not handling table name case insensitivity properly when checking against the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd`. This results in the assertion error "False is not true" in the failing test cases, as the function is not returning the expected output.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" has already identified the issue and suggested a fix of checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. The subsequent GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" further emphasizes the need to address this case insensitivity issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the `stdout` result. We can use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now handle case insensitivity properly, and the failing test cases should pass. The GitHub issue has been addressed, and the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
