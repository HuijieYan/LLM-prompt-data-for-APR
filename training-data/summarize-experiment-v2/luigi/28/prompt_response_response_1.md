The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be related to how it handles the case-sensitivity of table names and partitions, as well as a potential logic error that causes the incorrect output for different test cases.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle case-insensitive table names and partitions, and the logic should be adjusted to generate the expected output for all test cases. Based on the GitHub issue, it seems like checking the `stdout` against the lowercased table name would resolve the case sensitivity issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected code should address the case sensitivity issue and produce the expected output for the failing test cases. It also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Overall, this fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all test cases.
