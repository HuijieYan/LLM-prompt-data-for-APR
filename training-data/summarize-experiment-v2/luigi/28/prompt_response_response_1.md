## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not being case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. It seems that the function is not handling the case where the table name is in different cases than the one returned by the command.

By analyzing the failing test cases and the input/output variable information, it is evident that the function is not returning the correct output in these cases due to the comparison not being case insensitive.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case or upper case before comparing them.

Another approach could be using the `in` keyword along with case conversion to check if the table name exists within the stdout, also in a case-insensitive manner.

## Corrected Code

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is done in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## GitHub Issue Response

In response to the GitHub issue, the fix has been implemented as suggested, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout.

The GitHub issue should be closed with the message that the fix has been implemented and the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive, addressing the problem reported in the issue.

By making the function case insensitive, it allows for easier integration with table names defined in different cases and ensures the function behaves as expected when dealing with case variations in table names.
