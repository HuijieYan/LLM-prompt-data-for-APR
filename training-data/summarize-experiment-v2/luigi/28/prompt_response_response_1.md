The issue with the buggy function is related to the conditional checks and case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a hive database. The function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, which results in failing tests.

To fix the issue, the conditional checks for table existence need to be updated to handle case insensitivity. The function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

The above fix ensures that the `table_exists` function correctly handles case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This solution addresses the Github issue related to the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` method.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the failing test and address the case insensitivity issue.
