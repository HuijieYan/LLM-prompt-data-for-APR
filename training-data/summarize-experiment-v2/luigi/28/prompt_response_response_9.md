Potential error location within the problematic function:

The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the `table_exists` function. The function is not taking into account the case sensitivity of the table names when comparing them to the output from the Hive command.

Bug's Cause:
The `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table names to the output from the Hive command. This leads to the function returning incorrect results and causing the tests to fail.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
The function should be modified to be case insensitive when comparing the table names to the output from the Hive command.

Here's a suggested fix for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The updated code uses the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

The corrected code satisfies the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information.

GitHub Issue Information:
The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" has been identified as being related to this bug. It discusses the case sensitivity issue with table names and suggests using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to fix the problem.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" provides a concise description of the issue and the proposed solution.

By addressing the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function, the bug can be resolved in line with the suggestions from the GitHub issues.
