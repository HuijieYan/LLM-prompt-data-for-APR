Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the table_exists function when checking the stdout against the table name. To fix this, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version makes the table name comparison case insensitive, which should fix the issue with false positives or false negatives when testing the table_exists function. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" also supports this fix, so it aligns with the proposed solution.

By using this corrected version of the function, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
