The issue in the `__init__` function is that the code is not properly indented and the `time` module is being used without being imported. 

To fix the code, we need to properly indent the function and import the `time` module.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected code properly indents the `__init__` function and imports the `time` module. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
