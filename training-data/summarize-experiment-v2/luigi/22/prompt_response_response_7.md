The issue in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, and then used in a comparison without checking for its existence. 

To fix this issue, we can check if `last_active` is `None` before using it in the comparison. If it is `None`, we can set it to the current time.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `__init__` function will set the `last_active` attribute to the provided value if it's not `None`, otherwise, it will set it to the current time.

This correction should resolve the TypeError that was raised, and the function should now pass the failing test.
