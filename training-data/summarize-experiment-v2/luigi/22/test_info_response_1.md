The error message is a TypeError, specifically an unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int', at 'luigi/scheduler.py:245'. The failing test is 'test_worker_prune_after_init' which specifically calls the 'prune' method on a luigi.scheduler.Worker object. The exact line in the code where the error is originating from is 'if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():'. This error occurs because 'last_active' is initialized to 'None' when the 'Worker' object is being created.

Simplified error message:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int' in luigi/scheduler.py at line 245
