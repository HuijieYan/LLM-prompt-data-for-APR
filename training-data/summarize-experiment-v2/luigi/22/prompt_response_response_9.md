The bug in the `__init__` method in the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class is caused by the improper indentation and the missing import statement for the `time` module. This results in the `time` module not being available and causes a TypeError when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be properly indented and the `time` module should be imported. Once these issues are addressed, the function should properly initialize the attributes and work as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Fixed and corrected version of the __init__ method
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        import time  # import the time module
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the `time` module is properly imported and the `__init__` method is correctly indented. This fixed version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the TypeError that was previously occurring.
