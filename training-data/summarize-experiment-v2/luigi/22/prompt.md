Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import time
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
```# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """


# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: test/scheduler_test.py

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

This error message indicates that there is a TypeError, specifically due to an unsupported operand type for the addition operation in the method `prune` of the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class. The fault location is within the `prune` method within the `luigi/scheduler.py` file on line 245.

The simplified error message is: 
"TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int' in prune method of luigi/scheduler.py at line 245."


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The buggy function is the init method of a class, and it initializes several attributes for the class instance. In this case, the function takes in a worker_id and last_active as parameters. It then sets the id, reference, last_active, started, tasks, and info attributes for the class instance.

In the given test case, the worker_id is 123 and the last_active is 1706548223.648739. The function correctly sets the id and last_active attributes to these values. The started attribute is initialized using time.time(), which will result in a different value each time the test is run. The tasks attribute is correctly initialized as an empty set, and the info attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary.

Based on the provided values and types of the variables inside the function, there doesn't appear to be a bug in this function. The function is correctly setting the attributes based on the input parameters provided. It's important to note that the started attribute will have a different value each time the test is run due to time.time(), which is expected behavior.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the buggy code, the `__init__` function is supposed to initialize various attributes of the `LuigiWorker` class. However, it seems there is an indentation issue and the function body is not properly indented. Additionally, the `time` module is being used without being imported.

The expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return are based on the assumption that the function is properly initialized. The `worker_id` should be assigned to `self.id`, the current time in seconds since epoch should be assigned to `self.started`, an empty set should be assigned to `self.tasks`, and an empty dictionary should be assigned to `self.info`.

To fix the code, the `__init__` function should be properly indented and the `time` module should be imported. Once these issues are addressed, the expected values and types of variables should align with the given test cases.


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, the expected input/output variable information, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class docs
   (c). The failing test
   (d). The corresponding error message
   (e). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value
   (f). Discrepancies between expected input/output variable value

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
   (b). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
