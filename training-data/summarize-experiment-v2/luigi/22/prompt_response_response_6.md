The bug is caused by an indentation issue in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Additionally, the `time` module is being used without being imported. This causes a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` when the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is called.

To fix this bug:

1. Ensure that the `time` module is imported at the beginning of the file.
2. Properly indent the `__init__` method and initialize the `last_active` attribute with a default value if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # Rest of the class methods...

# The failing test function for the buggy function
def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
    worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

    class TmpCfg:
        def __init__(self):
            self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

    worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the `prune` method of the `Worker` class should no longer raise a `TypeError`. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
