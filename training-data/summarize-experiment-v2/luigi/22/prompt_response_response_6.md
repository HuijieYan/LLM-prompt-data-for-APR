The issue with the `prune` method in the `Worker` class is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because `NoneType` cannot be added to an integer in the `if` condition.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `prune` method to handle the `None` case for `last_active` by checking if it's `None` and treating it as a time of 0 if it is. Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something here (e.g. remove worker from the scheduler)
            pass
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to 0 if it is `None`, and the `prune` method should now handle the `None` case properly. The code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
