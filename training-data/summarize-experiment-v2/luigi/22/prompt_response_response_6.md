The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the last_active parameter is None. This leads to a TypeError when trying to add a delay to a None value. To fix this, we can set a default value for last_active if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now the corrected function should handle the case when last_active is not provided and set it to the current time.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
