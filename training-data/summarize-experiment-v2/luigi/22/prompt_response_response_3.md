# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
import time


class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The issue with the original code was the indentation of the `Worker` class and the `__init__` method. The `time` module was also not being imported in the original code. Both of these issues have been fixed in the corrected version of the code. 
This corrected version of the code should now be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
