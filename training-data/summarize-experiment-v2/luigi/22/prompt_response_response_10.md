The issue in the code is that the `last_active` parameter can be `None` which causes the `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. To fix this, we can check if `last_active` is `None` and if so, initialize it to the current time.

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # add your logic here
```

With this fix, the code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
