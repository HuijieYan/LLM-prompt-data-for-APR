```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
As a drop-in replacement, this corrected version of the function addresses the potential issue with `last_active` being set to `None`. In the corrected version, `last_active` is set to the current time if it is not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.

Now, when the failing test is executed, the corrected function should produce the expected output for Case 1.
