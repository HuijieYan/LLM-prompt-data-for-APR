```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The corrected version of the function includes a check to see if last_active is None, and if it is, it initializes it to the current time using `time.time()`, otherwise it uses the provided last_active value. This change ensures that there are no unsupported operand types for addition when performing the comparison in the `prune` method.

The corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement in the failing test.
