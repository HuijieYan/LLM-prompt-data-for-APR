The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called.

To fix this, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time. 

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly handled, and the `prune` method should work as expected.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test.
