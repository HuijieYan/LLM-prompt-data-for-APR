The bug in the code is happening due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix this bug, you should modify the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class to provide a default value for `last_active` when it's not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, if `last_active` is not provided, the current time will be used as the default value, ensuring that it's always a valid timestamp.

This corrected code should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
