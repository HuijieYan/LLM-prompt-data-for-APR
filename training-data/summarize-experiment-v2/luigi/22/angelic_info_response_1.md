In the buggy code, the `__init__` function is supposed to initialize various attributes of the `LuigiWorker` class. However, it seems there is an indentation issue and the function body is not properly indented. Additionally, the `time` module is being used without being imported.

The expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return are based on the assumption that the function is properly initialized. The `worker_id` should be assigned to `self.id`, the current time in seconds since epoch should be assigned to `self.started`, an empty set should be assigned to `self.tasks`, and an empty dictionary should be assigned to `self.info`.

To fix the code, the `__init__` function should be properly indented and the `time` module should be imported. Once these issues are addressed, the expected values and types of variables should align with the given test cases.
