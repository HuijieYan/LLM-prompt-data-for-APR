Based on the provided information, the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is likely due to improper indentation and missing import statement for the `time` module.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function should be properly indented and the `time` module should be imported at the beginning of the file. Once these issues are addressed, the function should be able to properly initialize the attributes of the `LuigiWorker` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `__init__` function should now properly initialize the attributes of the `Worker` class. It should also pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` without any issues.
