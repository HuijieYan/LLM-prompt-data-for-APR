The bug is caused by the default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter. When the `prune()` method is called, it tries to use `last_active` in an expression without first checking if it has been assigned a value. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided. We can use the `or` operator to achieve this in the constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the fix applied:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active or time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning
            pass
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it can be safely used in the `prune()` method.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
