The issue in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is that it is trying to add `NoneType` (the value of `self.last_active` when it's not provided) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `self.last_active` is `None` and set a default value for it in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass  # replace this with actual pruning logic
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method now has a default value of `time.time()` if it's not provided. This will ensure that the `prune` method does not encounter a `NoneType` when adding the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
