The problem with the buggy function is that it is not properly formatted with correct indentation, and it is using the 'time' module without being imported. This is causing a TypeError in the prune method of the luigi.scheduler.Worker class.

To fix the bug, we need to properly indent the __init__ method and import the 'time' module. Additionally, we need to ensure that the last_active parameter defaults to None if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the fixed function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function should now properly initialize the attributes of the Worker class and pass the failing test.
