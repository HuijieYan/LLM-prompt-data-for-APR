Suggested approach to fix the bug:
- Update the __init__ function of the Worker class to set a default value for last_active if it is not provided. The default value should be None to maintain consistency with the current behavior.
- When checking if a worker should be pruned, handle the case where last_active is None separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
```

By making these changes, the function will handle the case where last_active is None and prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
