The potential error in the problematic function is an indentation issue and the fact that the `time` module is being used without being imported. The `time` module is used to get the current time in seconds since epoch, which is then assigned to the `self.started` attribute. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError due to unsupported operand types. This could be caused by the `self.started` attribute not being properly initialized.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the `__init__` function needs to be properly indented to ensure that the attributes are initialized correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
This fixed version of the function initializes the `started` attribute using the `time` module, which should resolve the TypeError issue. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
