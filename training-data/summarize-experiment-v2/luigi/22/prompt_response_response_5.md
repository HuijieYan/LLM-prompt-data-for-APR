The buggy function is failing because it is trying to add an integer to a NoneType, resulting in a TypeError. The issue is with the last_active variable being assigned a default value of None, and then used in a comparison without checking for None.

To fix this issue, we can modify the __init__ function to ensure that last_active is set to the current time if no value is provided. This will prevent it from being None when it is used in the prune function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning here
            pass
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the input/output variable information provided.
