The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType'. The failing test also confirms that the `columns` parameter is set to `None` when the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object is instantiated.

The related GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This would check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length, preventing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `copy` function should be modified as suggested in the GitHub issue:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This will ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None.

By implementing this change, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test. The updated code for the `copy` function would look like this:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.
