The potential error location is within the `copy` function of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, specifically within the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement.

The bug is caused by the `colnames` variable being assigned an empty string before being used in the SQL query. If `self.columns` is empty, `colnames` will remain as an empty string, leading to an invalid SQL query when used in the `COPY` command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing `colnames` and handle the case when there are no column names.

```python
if self.columns:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
else:
    colnames = ''
```

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
