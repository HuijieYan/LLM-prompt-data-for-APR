The potential error location within the problematic function is within the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

The bug's cause is that the colnames variable is being assigned an empty string even when self.columns is empty, which can lead to an invalid SQL query.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding a conditional statement to check if self.columns is empty before constructing colnames and handling the case when there are no column names.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should now accurately handle the case when self.columns is empty, ensuring that the colnames variable is populated with the column names only when they exist. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
