There is an issue with the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class where it tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not None.

The solution is to modify the conditional statement to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # modification here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function should handle the case where `self.columns` is None and the failing test should pass. This also addresses the GitHub issue that was raised regarding the bug.

This updated code should completely resolve the issue raised in the GitHub and successfully pass the failing test.
