```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before using len()
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not None before using the `len` function, we can prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This fix directly addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue by making the necessary adjustment to the code.

The corrected code satisfies the following criteria:
1. It passes the failing test by preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
2. It successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue by addressing the root cause.

This drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function will fix the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the Redshift COPY jobs to run successfully.
