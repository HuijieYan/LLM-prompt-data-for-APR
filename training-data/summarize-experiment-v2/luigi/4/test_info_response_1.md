Based on the error message, it can be inferred that the "TypeError" is raised when the length of the `self.columns` is checked in the `copy` function of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The specific fault location is within the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement in the `copy` function.

Simplified error message:
A TypeError is raised in the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file at line 356, specifically within the if statement checking the length of self.columns, which is of type 'NoneType'.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is attempting to run a task named `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with the columns set to `None`, which is causing the TypeError to be raised.
