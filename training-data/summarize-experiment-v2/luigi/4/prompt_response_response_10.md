### Bug Location
The potential error is located in the `copy` function, where it tries to access the `len` attribute of `self.columns`, which is None. This is likely causing the TypeError.

### Bug Cause
The `self.columns` attribute is being checked for its length without first checking if it exists or is not None. This results in a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

### Potential Fix
To fix this issue, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. If it is None, we can assume that there are no columns to be copied. We should also update the `colnames` variable accordingly.

### Updated Code
Here's the updated code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this update, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we assume that there are no columns to be copied and `colnames` remains an empty string.

### GitHub Issue Solution
The solution to the GitHub issue would be to provide this updated code and explain the rationale behind the change. The updated code will ensure that `self.columns` is checked for existence before trying to access its length, preventing the TypeError.

This solution should also be linked to the GitHub issue for reference.
