The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the fact that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. In the failing test, the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is instantiated with `columns=None`, leading to a TypeError when the `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, the `copy` function should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. 

A possible fix for the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and the TypeError should be resolved.

The corrected code for the problematic function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
