This corrected code now includes a check for `self.columns` before constructing the `colnames` variable. This fixes the bug where a TypeError was raised due to checking the length of `self.columns` when it was of type 'NoneType'.

This fix addresses the issue posted in the GitHub bug, and the corrected function should pass the failing test without any TypeError related to the length of columns being None.
