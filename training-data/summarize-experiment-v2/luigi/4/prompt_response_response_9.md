The root cause of the bug is that the `len` function is being called on `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when it is `None`. This happens in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get the length of it.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` method will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix should also address the issue posted in the GitHub issue.

This solution passes the failing test and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
