### Bug Cause
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is throwing a `TypeError` when the `self.columns` attribute is `None` because it's trying to check the length of the `None` object. This leads to a runtime error, as demonstrated in the failing test.

### Potential location of the bug
The potential location of the bug is identified in the following line of code:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first confirming that it is not `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. We can do this by using the `and` operator.

### Updated Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue title will be: "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided"

### GitHub Issue Description
Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The root cause seems to be [link to the specific line of code](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338). A possible solution would be to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, unless I am missing some reason to explicitly check only for the length of `self.columns`.

By following these suggestions, we can fix the bug and update the GitHub issue with the proposed solution.

These changes will resolve the bug and ensure that it passes the failing test and satisfies the GitHub issue.
