The issue here is that the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is set to `None`. This causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The code should be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. If it is None, then the `colnames` variable should also be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
# Inside the S3CopyToTable class
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and will not throw a `TypeError`. This modification should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. It also aligns with the suggestion on the GitHub issue.

After making this change, the Redshift COPY should work correctly even when `columns` are not provided, and the TypeError should no longer occur.
