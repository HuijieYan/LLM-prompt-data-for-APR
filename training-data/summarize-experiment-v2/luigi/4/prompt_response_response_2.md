The bug in the `copy` function is caused by attempting to call `len` on the `columns` attribute without checking if it's `None` first. This results in a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change ensures that `len` is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this change, the `copy` function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
