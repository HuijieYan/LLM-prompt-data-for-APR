The root cause of the bug is that the `copy` function doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to use `len` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compute the length of the columns.

Here is the corrected `copy` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the issue reported in the GitHub thread will be resolved, and the `TypeError` caused by passing `None` for the columns parameter will be avoided. The updated `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before using `len` on it. The updated code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue.

Please replace the existing `copy` function with the corrected version provided above to address the bug.
