## Bug Cause
The `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is caused by trying to call `len()` on `self.columns` when it is `None`. This happens in the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string `''` when `self.columns` is empty, but the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check is not guarding against the `None` type.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None in the `if` condition.
2. Add input validation to ensure that `columns` is not None when initializing the `S3CopyToTable` class.
3. Modify the logic in the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

## The corrected code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` condition guards against calling `len()` on a `None` type object, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
