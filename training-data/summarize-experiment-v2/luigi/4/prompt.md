Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

Based on the error message, it can be inferred that the "TypeError" is raised when the length of the `self.columns` is checked in the `copy` function of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The specific fault location is within the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement in the `copy` function.

Simplified error message:
A TypeError is raised in the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file at line 356, specifically within the if statement checking the length of self.columns, which is of type 'NoneType'.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is attempting to run a task named `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with the columns set to `None`, which is causing the TypeError to be raised.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The function `copy` is meant to define the process of copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the `colnames` variable. It is used to store a comma-separated list of column names, but it is being assigned an empty string before being used in the SQL query, which may cause issues in the query execution.

The `colnames` variable is constructed by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but if `self.columns` is empty, `colnames` will remain as an empty string. This can lead to an invalid SQL query when `colnames` is used in the `COPY` command.

To fix this bug, you should check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing `colnames` and handle the case when there are no column names. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check the length of `self.columns` and only constructing `colnames` if it's not empty.

```python
if self.columns:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
else:
    colnames = ''
```

With this change, the bug should be fixed, and the `colnames` variable will be correctly populated with the column names when they exist.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

GitHub Bug Title:
Redshift COPY fails in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided

Description:
When running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prevent table creation, it fails in Luigi 2.7.1 with a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). The issue appears to be related to a specific line in the code. A potential solution would be to make a change to that line.

Expected Output:
When using Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None in Luigi 2.7.1, the operation should not fail with a TypeError related to the length of columns being None.

Environment:
- Python: 3.7.3.final.0
- numpy: 1.18.1
- matplotlib: 3.1.2
- scipy: 1.3.0
- xlrd: 1.2.0
