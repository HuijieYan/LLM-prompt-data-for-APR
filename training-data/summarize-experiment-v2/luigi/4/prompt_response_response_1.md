By adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that an error will not occur when `self.columns` is None. This approach aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

With this corrected code, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without encountering the "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" error. It also satisfies the requirements of passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
