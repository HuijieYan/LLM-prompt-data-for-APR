The cause of the bug is that when the columns parameter is set to None, the buggy function does not handle this case correctly, which leads to a TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to handle the case when columns is None. We can do this by checking if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the modified function will handle the case when columns is None and should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
