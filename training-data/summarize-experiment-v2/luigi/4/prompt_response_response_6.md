The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling the case when self.columns is None. The buggy function is checking the length of self.columns without first checking if it is None, which causes the TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to first check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the buggy function will first check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

This will resolve the issue and the corrected code will pass the failing test and should also address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
