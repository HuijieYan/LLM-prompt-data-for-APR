Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
         Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
         If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )

    # The declaration of the class containing the buggy function

    def _credentials(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

```

This corrected version includes a fix for the bug in the `copy` function. We check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`, which resolves the TypeError issue.

This fixed version of the function should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to the bug.
