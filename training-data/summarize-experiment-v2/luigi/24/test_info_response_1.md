The error message seems to be related to the original source code. The error is thrown due to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list attributes. The error originates from the `luigi.contrib.spark.subprocess.Popen` method being called with different parameters than expected. The actual call is not in line with the expected list structure. 

Original error message:
```
E       AssertionError: Lists differ: ['ss-stub', '--master', 'yarn-client', '--deploy-mode', 'client', '... != ['ss-stub', '--master', 'yarn-client', ...]
E       
E       First differing element <element>
E       <line 1>
E       <line 2>
E       
E       Diff is 812 characters long. Set self.maxDiff to None to see it.
```

Simplified error message:
```
E       AssertionError: Lists differ: Expected list != Actual list, First differing element at <line number>
```
