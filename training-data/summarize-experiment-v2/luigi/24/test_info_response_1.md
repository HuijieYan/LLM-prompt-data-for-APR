The error message from the failing test for the using the `_dict_args` function is related to an assertion error in unit tests declared in the spark_test.py file. It is failing with an "AssertionError" because of the incorrect comparison of the proc.call args with another list. It is recognizing the individual strings in the list as different from each other because of the formatting that was used.

The two failing test asserts are looking into the arguments process of subprocess.Popen and are failing with differences in the value of the strings. The issue seems to be related to mishandling of the calls of commands and their arguments.
The error message indicates that the method _dict_arg does not format the command args properly producing incorrect assertions.
The standard list comparison is done by checking the elements at each index in the list. In the error message, as seen in the diff, the string 'prop1=val1' is compared with '"prop1=val1"' and failing. 

A part of the error is due to the incorrect formatting of the string as it is producing a different type of quote in the strings compared, leading to the assertion error.
