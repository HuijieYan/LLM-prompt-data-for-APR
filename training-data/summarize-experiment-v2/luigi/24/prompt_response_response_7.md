The potential error location within the problematic function is the formatting of the command list. In the current implementation, the function is adding extra quotes to the value, which is causing the discrepancy in the test cases.

The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly formats the command list by adding unnecessary quotes around the value.

To fix the bug, the function should only add the key-value pair to the command list without adding extra quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected implementation removes the unnecessary quotes around the value when adding it to the command list. This function now generates the expected command line arguments as required.

Please note that this corrected version should be placed within the `SparkSubmitTask` class.
