The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly formats the command arguments. It adds an extra pair of quotes around each key-value pair, which is not expected. This causes the failing tests to assert incorrectly.

To fix this, we need to remove the additional quotes around the key-value formatting in the list comprehension.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
