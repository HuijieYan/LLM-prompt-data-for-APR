The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a `name` and `value` and construct a command list based on these input parameters. The issue with the current implementation is that the function is not correctly formatting the command list when the `value` is a dictionary. Instead of creating a command list with key-value pairs formatted as strings, it is simply adding the keys and values as separate elements in the list.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the key-value pairs as strings before adding them to the `command` list. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `name` is added to each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the key-value pairs and include the `name` for each key-value pair in the `command` list. This should resolve the issue with the failing test cases and make the function behave as expected.
