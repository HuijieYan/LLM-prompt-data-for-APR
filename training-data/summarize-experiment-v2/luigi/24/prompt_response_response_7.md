Based on the analysis, the issue with the function `_dict_arg` is that it is incorrectly enclosing the argument values within double quotes. This is causing the comparison failure in the test cases. To fix this, we need to modify the function to format the command arguments without enclosing the values in quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The function now formats the command arguments without enclosing the values in quotes. This should fix the comparison failure in the test cases.

Using this corrected function should make the failing test cases pass, and it satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
