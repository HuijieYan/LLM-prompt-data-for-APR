The _dict_arg function is intended to convert a dictionary value into a list of command-line arguments. It iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and appends them to the command list in the format "name='value'".

In the first case, the input dictionary {'Prop': 'Value'} is correctly transformed into the list ['--conf', 'Prop=Value'].

In the second case, the input dictionary {'prop1': 'val1'} is also correctly transformed into the list ['--conf', 'prop1=val1'].

Both cases show that the function correctly handles the dictionary input and converts it into the desired command format.

It is important to note that the fix for this function should focus on the correctness of the command list generation, and also consider edge cases such as empty dictionary input or non-dictionary input. Additionally, the function could benefit from clearer variable names to avoid confusion between the outer 'value' and the inner 'value' within the for loop.
