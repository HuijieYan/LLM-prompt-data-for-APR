Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the creation of the `command` list. The bug causes the command list to be constructed incorrectly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

The function should properly handle the input dictionary by iterating through its key-value pairs and constructing the command list accordingly. The values should be formatted as strings with the key and value separated by an equal sign.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val" to avoid reusing the same variable name
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use "val" instead of "value"
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should properly construct the command list and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected command lists.
