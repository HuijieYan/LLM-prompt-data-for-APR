    # corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change value to val to avoid variable name conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes around {0}={1}
        return command
```

The main issue in the original `_dict_arg` function is that it was incorrectly adding double quotes around the `name='value'` format. Additionally, there was a variable name conflict within the for loop. The corrected function removes the unnecessary double quotes and renames the inner variable to avoid conflicts. This ensures that the function generates the correct command list format.

Now the corrected function will handle input dictionary properly and generate the expected command line arguments.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
