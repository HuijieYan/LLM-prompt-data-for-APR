Based on the failing test cases and the input parameters and expected return values, it is evident that the issue lies in the way the `value` and `prop` are being formatted in the `command` list. The current implementation is not adding quotes around the key-value pair of the dictionary. This is leading to incorrect comparisons in the test cases.

To fix this, the `command` list should include the key-value pair of the dictionary inside double quotes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
