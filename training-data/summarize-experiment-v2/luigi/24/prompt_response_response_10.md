The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs when forming the command list. This causes the comparison to fail in the test cases.

To fix this, we need to remove the double quotes from around the key-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification removes the double quotes from around the key-value pairs in the `command` list, which should allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
