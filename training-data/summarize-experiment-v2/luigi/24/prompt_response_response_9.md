Based on the failing test cases, the issue seems to be with the creation of the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is supposed to create a list of command line arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. However, it is currently not formatting the command properly.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the command list. Specifically, we need to format the `value` and `prop` variables with a specific format and then append them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected formatting here
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the command list based on the input dictionary `value`. It should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
