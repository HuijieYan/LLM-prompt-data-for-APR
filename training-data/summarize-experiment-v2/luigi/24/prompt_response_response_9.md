The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly formats the key-value pairs when constructing the command. The values should not be enclosed within quotes as it results in a mismatch when comparing the arguments in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command without enclosing the values in quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function removes the unnecessary quotes around the values, which should resolve the comparison issues in the failing tests.
