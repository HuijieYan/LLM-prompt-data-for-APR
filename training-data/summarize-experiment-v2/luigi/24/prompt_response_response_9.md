The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not formatting the dictionary values properly before adding them to the `command` list. The values should be formatted with double quotes, but this is currently missing in the function. 

To fix this, we can update the function to properly format the dictionary values before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will now properly format the dictionary values with double quotes, which should resolve the failing tests and the assertion errors.
