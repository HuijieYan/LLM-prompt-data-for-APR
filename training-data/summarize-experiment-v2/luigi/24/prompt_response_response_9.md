The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the inner loop variable. This is leading to confusion and incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable to something different, such as `key_value_pair`, and also ensure that it is properly formatted as a string with the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task): 
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In this corrected version, the inner loop variable has been renamed to `val` to avoid confusion with the outer `value` parameter. Additionally, the format for the command list has been corrected to use `{0}={1}` to correctly represent the key-value pairs.

This corrected version should now correctly handle the input dictionary and generate the expected command line arguments.
