The bug in the function is caused by concatenating the name and value with an equal sign in between, but not wrapping the value in double quotes if it contains the equal sign. This leads to incorrect formatting of command arguments, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to properly wrap the value in double quotes if it contains the equal sign.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            value_pair = '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val) if '=' in str(val) else '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)
            command += [name, value_pair]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will properly format the command arguments and should pass the failing tests. This corrected function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
