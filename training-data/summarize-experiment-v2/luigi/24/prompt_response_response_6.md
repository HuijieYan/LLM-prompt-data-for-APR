```python
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid confusion with the outer 'value'
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated the format of the command to include '--'
        return command
```

By making these changes, the corrected function will now properly handle the input dictionary and generate the expected command line arguments.

Please note that the corrected code includes the changes described, and it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
