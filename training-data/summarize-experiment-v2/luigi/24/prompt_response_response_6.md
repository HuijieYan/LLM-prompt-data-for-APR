Based on the given information and error analysis, it seems that the issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is improperly handling key-value pairs and mistakenly wrapping the value in double quotes. To fix this, we need to adjust the function to handle the key-value pairs correctly and not wrap the value in quotes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The key adjustment here is to remove the double quotes around the value in the format function, as the value should not be quoted in the command.

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now handle the key-value pairs correctly and format the command as expected, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
