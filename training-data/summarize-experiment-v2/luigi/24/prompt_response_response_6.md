The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly constructs the `command` list by adding the name and value of each item in the input dictionary. However, it adds the value in a format that is not expected by the test cases.

To fix this, we can update the `_dict_arg` function to add the value in the format expected by the test cases. Additionally, we need to check if the input `value` is not None before processing it as a dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will construct the `command` list in the expected format. It will also handle the case when the `value` is None.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
