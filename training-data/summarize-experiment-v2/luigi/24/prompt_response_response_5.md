The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs as separate strings inside a list, leading to assertion errors in the test cases. To fix this, we need to modify the way the command list is constructed so that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key-value pairs will be properly formatted as a single string inside the list. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
