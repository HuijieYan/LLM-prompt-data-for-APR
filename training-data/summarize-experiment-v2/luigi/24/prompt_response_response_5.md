The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the values when creating the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the values are added to the command list without quotes and with the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly format the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the values. This will ensure that the failing tests pass and the expected input/output variable information is satisfied.
