The buggy function `_dict_arg` is expecting a `name` and `value` (which is supposed to be a dictionary) and converts it into a list of command line arguments. However, the function is currently not handling the dictionary input correctly, leading to failing tests.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the variable name `value` inside the for loop, overriding the value of the input.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the buggy function `_dict_arg`, the related class docs, the failing test, and the corresponding error message, which shows discrepancies between the actual and expected command line arguments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be revised to properly handle the dictionary input and generate the expected command line arguments. This can be achieved by using a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overriding the `value` from the input.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle the dictionary input and generate the expected command line arguments. This corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
