Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue seems to be related to the concatenation of the `name` and the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` within the list. This results in an unexpected structure of the command list.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect concatenation of the `name` and the formatted string within the list. This results in a command list that does not match the expected structure, leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command list is constructed correctly with the appropriate formatting. One approach could be to use a single string for each key-value pair within the command list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Use a single string for each key-value pair
    return command
```

The corrected code should ensure that the command list is constructed in a way that matches the expected structure and satisfies the failing test cases.
