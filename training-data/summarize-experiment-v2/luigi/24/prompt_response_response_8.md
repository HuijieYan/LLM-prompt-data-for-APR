The issue in the _dict_arg function is that it is adding quotes around the value when constructing the command list, which is causing the failing assertion in the test cases. The function should not add quotes around the value.

To fix this, we will update the _dict_arg function to construct the command list without adding quotes around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the value in the format method, we ensure that the command list is constructed without improperly enclosed values.

This corrected version of the function satisfies the expectations in the failing test cases and should fix the bug.

The entire class with the corrected function is as follows:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command

def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
```

This corrected version of the class can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy version and should pass the failing test cases.
