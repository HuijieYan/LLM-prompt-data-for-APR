The issue with the buggy function is that it is not formatting the command arguments properly. It needs to create a string in the format "key=value" and then add it to the command list. 

To fix this issue, we can update the `_dict_arg` function to format the command arguments correctly and return the formatted command list. 

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now properly format the command arguments and return the expected output. This updated function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
