Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with how the `command` list is being constructed. The elements in the list are not being formatted correctly with the double quotes.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is not formatting the dictionary values properly when constructing the command list. It is not handling the values of the dictionary and the double quotes properly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the way the `command` list is being constructed. When iterating through the dictionary items, the values should be formatted with double quotes before being added to the `command` list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Format the value with double quotes
            formatted_value = '"{}={}"'.format(prop, val)
            command += [name, formatted_value]
    return command
```

By using the corrected code, the function should format the dictionary values correctly and construct the `command` list as expected. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
