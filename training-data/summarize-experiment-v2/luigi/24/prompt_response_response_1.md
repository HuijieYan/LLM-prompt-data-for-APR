The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not formatting the command arguments properly, which is causing the failing test. The function should format the command arguments as key=value pairs enclosed in double quotes.

In order to fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function can be updated to correctly format the command arguments. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated value to val to avoid shadowing the variable name
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the command arguments, and the failing tests should pass as expected. This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated value to val to avoid shadowing the variable name
        return command
```
