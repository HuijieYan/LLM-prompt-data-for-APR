The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly generating the command list from a dictionary input. It is converting the key-value pairs into arguments separated by the equal sign, but it is not handling them in the correct format for a command-line argument. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly generate the command list from the dictionary input, ensuring that the arguments are formatted correctly. Additionally, it should handle edge cases such as empty dictionary input or non-dictionary input.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected version should now handle the dictionary input correctly and generate the command list in the expected format. This should fix the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
