Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command arguments. The bug seems to be due to the lack of adding double quotes around the key-value pairs of the dictionary passed to the function.

To fix this bug, you should modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the key-value pairs with double quotes and equal signs before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By implementing this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the command arguments for the given dictionary input, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and passing the failing test cases.
