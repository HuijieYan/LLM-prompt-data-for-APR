The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary `value` and create a list `command` based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The function checks if the `value` parameter is a non-empty dictionary, and if so, it iterates through the key-value pairs and appends them to the `command` list.

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not format the key-value pairs correctly. It is adding the `name` attribute to the `command` list repeatedly for each key-value pair, and it also wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes, which is unnecessary. This results in an incorrectly formatted `command` list, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list attributes in the tests.

To fix the bug, the function should only append the formatted key-value pairs to the `command` list. Additionally, the formatting should be done without unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary and create a `command` list that matches the expected format in the tests.

This correction should address the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
