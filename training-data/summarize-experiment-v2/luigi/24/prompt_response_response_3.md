The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs because the values are not properly formatted when constructing the command list.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the values are formatted correctly, with the key and value pair enclosed in quotes if the value is a string. Additionally, we should remove the existing quotes from the values to avoid double quoting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs and construct the command list as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
