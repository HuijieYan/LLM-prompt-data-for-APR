The function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a `name` and a `value` (which is expected to be a dictionary) and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, the function is currently not handling the dictionary input correctly.

In case 1, the function should take the input dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The expected output should include the `name` followed by each key-value pair in the dictionary, formatted as strings. Additionally, the individual `prop` and `value` should also be extracted for later use.

In case 2, the same process should occur, with the input dictionary `value` being converted into command line arguments, and the individual `prop` and `value` being extracted correctly.

These cases indicate that the function is not properly handling the input dictionary and generating the command line arguments as expected. A corrected function should handle the dictionary input properly and generate the expected command line arguments.
