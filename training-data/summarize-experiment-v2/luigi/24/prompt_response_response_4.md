The issue in the buggy function is that it is missing the correct string formatting inside the list. It is not adding the command line arguments in the correct format and is not wrapping the key-value pairs in double quotes. This results in the failing tests as the comparison between the actual and expected command is failing due to incorrect formatting of the strings.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs in the command list are properly formatted with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the _dict_arg function will now correctly format the key-value pairs and wrap them in double quotes, which should resolve the failing tests and produce the expected input/output variable values.
