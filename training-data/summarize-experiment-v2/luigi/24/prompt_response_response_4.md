The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. It iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list, formatted as strings.

The bug in the function is that it does not correctly format the key-value pairs as strings when adding them to the `command` list. As a result, the final command list is not as expected, resulting in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should properly format the key-value pairs as strings before appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Format the key-value pair as a string
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the key-value pairs as strings before adding them to the `command` list, and it will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This correction will also fix the failing test cases and prevent the error message related to the mismatch in the expected and actual command list attributes.
