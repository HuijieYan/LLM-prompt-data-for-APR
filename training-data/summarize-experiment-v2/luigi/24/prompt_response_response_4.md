The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary value into a list of command-line arguments. In the provided code, it iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and appends them to the command list in the format `name='value'`. The issue seems to be with the string formatting where the values are enclosed in unnecessary double quotes.

Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`.

The cause of the bug is that the current string formatting adds unnecessary double quotes to the value, causing discrepancies between the actual and expected command line arguments.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the string formatting to ensure that the command list is generated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the dictionary input and generate the expected command-line arguments.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and generate the expected command list based on the input dictionary, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
