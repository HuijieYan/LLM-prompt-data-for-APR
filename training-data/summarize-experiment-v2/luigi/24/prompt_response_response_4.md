Based on the input and output variable information, it appears that the issue is with the way the key-value pairs are being formatted in the `command` list. The values are being enclosed in quotes when they should not be, leading to discrepancies when comparing the actual and expected values.

To fix this issue, the `command` list should be built without enclosing the values in quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `command` list will be built without unnecessary quotes around the values, which should resolve the discrepancies and make the failing tests pass.
