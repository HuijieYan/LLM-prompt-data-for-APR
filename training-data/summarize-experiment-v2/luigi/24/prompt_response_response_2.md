The problem in the _dict_arg function is that it incorrectly constructs the command list. The function is supposed to take a dictionary as input, iterate through its items, and construct the command list based on the key-value pairs of the dictionary. However, it currently constructs the command list incorrectly by adding the name parameter multiple times which results in an incorrect command list.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should construct the command list properly by concatenating the name parameter and the key-value pair within the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

After making this correction, the function should construct the command list accurately according to the input dictionary. This change should resolve the failing test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
