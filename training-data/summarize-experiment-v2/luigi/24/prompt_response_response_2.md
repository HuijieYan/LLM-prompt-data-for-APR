The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list when processing the input dictionary. The function is not properly handling the dictionary input and generating the command line arguments as expected.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly iterate through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and append them to the command list in the format "name=value". Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as empty dictionary input or non-dictionary input.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function properly handles the dictionary input and generates the command line arguments as expected. It also includes the handling of edge cases such as empty dictionary input or non-dictionary input. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
