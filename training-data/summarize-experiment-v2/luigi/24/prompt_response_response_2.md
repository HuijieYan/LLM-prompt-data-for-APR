Based on the analysis, it appears that the issue with the `_dict_arg` function is related to the way key-value pairs are being formatted. The values should not be enclosed in quotes. Additionally, the values and keys should be concatenated with an equals sign.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly and do not include unnecessary quotes.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
