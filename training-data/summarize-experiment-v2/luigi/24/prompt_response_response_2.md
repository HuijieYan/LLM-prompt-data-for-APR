Based on the failing tests and the discrepancies between the actual and expected input/output variable values, it appears that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the formatting of the command arguments. The function is not correctly formatting the strings when constructing the command list, which leads to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should use proper formatting to ensure that the command arguments are constructed with the expected quotations and escaped characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the `_dict_arg` function should now properly format the command arguments and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
