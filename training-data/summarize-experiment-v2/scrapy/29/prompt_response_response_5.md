The issue in the code is related to the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None` in certain cases, causing an error when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value in such cases. Additionally, we should also handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function, including the fix:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None and parsed.hostname != '':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        # provide a default value for the hostname if it's None or empty
        s += b"Host: localhost\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the function now includes a conditional check for the `parsed.hostname` variable and provides a default value of `'localhost'` if it's `None` or empty.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test without any errors.
