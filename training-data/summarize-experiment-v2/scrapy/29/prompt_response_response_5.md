The error occurs in the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` part of the code, specifically when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it expects a string, but receives a `NoneType` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to concatenate it with other bytes.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Add a condition to check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this change, we are now handling the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and only adding the hostname to the bytes representation if it exists. This should fix the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.

By making this change, the `request_httprepr` function should now pass the failing test.
