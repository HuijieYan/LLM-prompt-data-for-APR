Given the error message and the function in question, it seems that the issue may lie with the `parsed.hostname` value being `None` for non-HTTP requests. The `None` value is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError.

To address this issue, we can modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value. We can use an empty string as the default value for `parsed.hostname` in this case.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Providing a default value for parsed.hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `parsed.hostname` is provided with a default value of an empty string if it is `None`, which should prevent the TypeError from being raised in the original implementation.

This corrected implementation should now pass the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` and not raise the TypeError that was encountered before.
