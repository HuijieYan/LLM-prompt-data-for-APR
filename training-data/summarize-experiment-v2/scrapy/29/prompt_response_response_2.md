The issue in the buggy function is that the `parsed.hostname` is not always populated, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this, we can update the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is available and then use it in the `s` string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code includes a check for `parsed.hostname` before using it in the `s` string, which should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
