The potential error in the buggy function is that the `urlunparse` function is not correctly constructed and it does not include the correct protocol ("HTTP/1.1") or the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers that are commonly included in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the protocol "HTTP/1.1" instead of the scheme from the parsed URL.
2. Include the "User-Agent" header and any other relevant headers if they are present in the request.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    path = urlunparse(('http', parsed.netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = b"{} {} HTTP/1.1\r\n".format(to_bytes(request.method), to_bytes(path))
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        if b'User-Agent' not in request.headers:
            request.headers[b'User-Agent'] = b'Scrapy'
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"User-Agent: Scrapy\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body

    return s
```
