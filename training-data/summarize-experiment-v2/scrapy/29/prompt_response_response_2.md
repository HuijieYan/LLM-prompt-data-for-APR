From the error message and the failing test, it seems that the issue is with the hostname of the parsed URL being `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` and raise a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the hostname is `None` and provide a default value for it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: " + b"localhost" + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not `None`. If it is `None`, we default to adding a hostname of "localhost" to the HTTP representation.

This should resolve the `TypeError` being raised due to `to_bytes` receiving a `NoneType`. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
