The issue in the buggy function is that the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` if the URL does not contain a hostname, such as in the case of a `file://` URL. This is causing the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` call to fail because it expects a string but receives a `None` value.

To fix this, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function will now handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and should pass the failing test without any errors.
