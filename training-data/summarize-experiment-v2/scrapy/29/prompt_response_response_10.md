The potential error location within the problematic function is the `urlunparse` method. It is using the scheme from the parsed URL instead of "HTTP/1.1".

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the information provided:
(a). The buggy function constructs the HTTP request string incorrectly and does not include the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers that are commonly included in an HTTP request.
(b). The failing test does not specifically test for the correct inclusion of the HTTP protocol, "Host" header, and other relevant headers.
(c). The error message states that the function `to_bytes` expected a unicode, str, or bytes object but received a NoneType, which occurred in the file `request.py` at line 82.
(d). The discrepancy between the actual input/output variable value is the incorrect inclusion of the HTTP protocol, "Host" header, and other relevant headers in the constructed HTTP request string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to correctly include the "HTTP/1.1" protocol in the HTTP request string.
2. Include the "User-Agent" header and other relevant headers if they are present in the request.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('http', parsed.netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass without any errors.
