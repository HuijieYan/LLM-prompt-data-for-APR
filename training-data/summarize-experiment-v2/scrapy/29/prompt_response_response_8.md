The potential error in the function is when getting the `parsed.hostname` since it is returning `None` and then trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function, which results in a `TypeError`. This is happening when non-HTTP requests are passed to the `request_httprepr` function, as shown in the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value. We can use an empty string as the default value for `parsed.hostname` if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function that includes the fix:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    else:
        host = b''
        
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `parsed.hostname` is checked for `None` and handled by using an empty byte string as the default value. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.

This corrected code should pass the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` and handle non-HTTP requests correctly.
