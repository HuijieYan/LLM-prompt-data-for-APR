The error is occurring in the `request_httprepr` function due to the `to_bytes` function being passed a `None` value for the `parsed.hostname` variable. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it expects a unicode, str, or bytes object, not a NoneType.

The bug is caused by the parsing of non-HTTP URLs which result in the `parsed.hostname` being `None` for such URLs. This is evident from the failing test where non-HTTP URLs are used.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None, and ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a None value.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before trying to use it in the `to_bytes` function. If it is None, use an empty string instead.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname is not None else b''
    s = method + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `to_bytes` function will not receive a None value, and the bug should be fixed. The corrected code should pass the failing test.
