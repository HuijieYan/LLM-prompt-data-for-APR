### 1. Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function, which occurs when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes. The variable `parsed.hostname` is `None`, hence causing the error.

### 2. Bug Location
The bug is located in the `request_httprepr` function, where the `parsed.hostname` is used without proper validation, leading to a `None` value.

### 3. Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being properly handled before using it to construct the HTTP representation.

### 4. Possible Fix
We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before using it in the construction of the HTTP representation.

### 5. Corrected Code

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
