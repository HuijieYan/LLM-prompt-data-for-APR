# The source code of the buggy function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # fix for potential NoneType
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"  # fix for potential NoneType
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the fixed code, we have added a condition to check if the `parsed.hostname` is not None before trying to concatenate it with the byte string. This should prevent the `to_bytes` function from receiving a `NoneType` and avoid the TypeError that was occurring in the original buggy function.

By making this small change, the function should now be able to handle cases where the `parsed.hostname` is None without raising an error, and should pass the failing test.

Please note that the `request_httprepr` function has been updated and provided as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy version.
