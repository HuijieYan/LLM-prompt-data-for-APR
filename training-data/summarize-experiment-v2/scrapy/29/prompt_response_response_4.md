#1. Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, and the actual input/output variable information:
   - The buggy function takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes.
   - The failing test function tests the behavior of the `request_httprepr` function for non-HTTP requests, and it is reported that the representation is not important but it must not fail.
   - The error message states that the `to_bytes` function expected a unicode, str, or bytes object but received a NoneType. This error occurred in the file `request.py` at line 82.
   - Actual input/output variable information:
     -- In the first case, the parsed URL is "file:///tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n".
     -- In the second case, the parsed URL is "ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n".

#2. Potential error location within the problematic function:
   - The potential error location is in constructing the HTTP request string where the incorrect protocol ("HTTP/1.1") is being used and the inclusion of the "Host" header is not handled correctly.

#3. Elucidation of the bug's cause:
   - (a). The `request_httprepr` function constructs the HTTP request string incorrectly, using the scheme from the parsed URL instead of "HTTP/1.1", and it doesn't include the necessary headers.
   - (b). The failing test checks the behavior of `request_httprepr` for non-HTTP requests, and it should not fail.
   - (c). The error message states that `to_bytes` expected a unicode, str, or bytes object but received a NoneType, indicating that `parsed.path` might be None, leading to the NoneType error.
   - (d). Actual input/output variables are incorrect HTTP request strings.

#4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use "HTTP/1.1" as the protocol for constructing the HTTP request string.
   - Include the "Host" header with the appropriate value.
   - Include other relevant headers if they are present in the request.

#5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = b"GET " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    return s
```
