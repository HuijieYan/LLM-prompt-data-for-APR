The `request_httprepr` function takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It first parses the request URL, then constructs the HTTP request string and returns it.

In the first case, the input request has a method of 'GET', empty headers, and an empty body. When the function is executed, the parsed URL is "file:///tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n".

In the second case, the input request has a method of 'GET', empty headers, and an empty body as well. The parsed URL is "ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n".

The bug in the function is that it constructs the HTTP request string incorrectly. It uses the scheme from the parsed URL instead of "HTTP/1.1". Additionally, it does not include the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers that are commonly included in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly construct the HTTP request string by using the correct protocol ("HTTP/1.1"), including the "Host" header with the appropriate value, and including other relevant headers if they are present in the request.
