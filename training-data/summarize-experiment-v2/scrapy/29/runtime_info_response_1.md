The core logic of the function appears to be related to parsing a request and constructing a byte string `s` based on the parsed request values.

Looking at the input parameters and variables right before the function's return, it seems that the function is correctly parsing the input request and constructing the byte string `s` appropriately based on the parsed request values in both cases.

Therefore, the reason for the discrepancy in the test cases might not lie in the core logic of the function itself, but possibly in how the input requests are being generated or how the test cases are being evaluated. This could include issues such as incorrect comparison of expected vs actual output, or incorrect initialization of the input parameters for the function.

Further analysis of the test cases and how they are being evaluated is needed to identify the actual cause of the failing tests.
