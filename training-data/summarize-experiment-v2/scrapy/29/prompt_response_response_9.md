The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This is where the TypeError is being raised due to `parsed.hostname` being NoneType.

The cause of the bug is that `parsed.hostname` can potentially be `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError.

The fix for this bug would be to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value instead.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
  
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
  
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `parsed.hostname` value is checked and if it is `None`, a default value of `b"localhost"` is used. This ensures that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `NoneType` and the TypeError is avoided.
