The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` potentially being `None` in some cases, which leads to an error when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fixed version of the function, it should pass the failing test without raising any errors.
