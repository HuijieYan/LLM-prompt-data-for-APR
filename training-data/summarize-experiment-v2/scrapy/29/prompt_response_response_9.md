The potential error location within the problematic function is where the 'parsed' object is used to construct the path and 'Host' header.

The bug's cause is that the function uses the scheme from the parsed URL instead of "HTTP/1.1" to construct the HTTP request string, and it does not include the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers that are commonly included in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug, the function should use "HTTP/1.1" for the protocol, include the "Host" header with the appropriate value, and include other relevant headers if they are present in the request.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)

    if parsed.scheme == 'http':
        protocol = b"HTTP/1.1"
    else:
        protocol = to_bytes(parsed.scheme.upper()) + b'/1.0'

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" " + protocol + b"\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        if b'User-Agent' not in request.headers:
            s += b"User-Agent: Scrapy\r\n"
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b''  # handle NoneType for request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test and provide the correct HTTP representation for the given request.
