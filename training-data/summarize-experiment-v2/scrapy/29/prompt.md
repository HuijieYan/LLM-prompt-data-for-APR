Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/utils/request.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/test_utils_request.py

    def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
        # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
        request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
        request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The original error message states that the function `to_bytes` expected a unicode, str, or bytes object but received a NoneType. This error occurred in the file `request.py` at line 82. 

Simplified error message:
```
TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The `request_httprepr` function takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It first parses the request URL, then constructs the HTTP request string and returns it.

In the first case, the input request has a method of 'GET', empty headers, and an empty body. When the function is executed, the parsed URL is "file:///tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n".

In the second case, the input request has a method of 'GET', empty headers, and an empty body as well. The parsed URL is "ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt" and the constructed HTTP request string is "GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n".

The bug in the function is that it constructs the HTTP request string incorrectly. It uses the scheme from the parsed URL instead of "HTTP/1.1". Additionally, it does not include the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers that are commonly included in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly construct the HTTP request string by using the correct protocol ("HTTP/1.1"), including the "Host" header with the appropriate value, and including other relevant headers if they are present in the request.


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The failing test
   (c). The corresponding error message
   (d). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
