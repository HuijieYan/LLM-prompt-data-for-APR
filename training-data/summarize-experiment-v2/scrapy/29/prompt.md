Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/utils/request.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/test_utils_request.py

    def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
        # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
        request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
        request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The error message is indicating that a TypeError is being raised in the function `request_httprepr` in the `scrapy/utils/request.py` file. The specific line in which the error is occurring is `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`, which is inside the `request_httprepr` function. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a value of `NoneType` and is unable to handle it. The test that triggered the error is `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` in `test_utils_request.py`.

Simplified Error Message:
```
TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The core logic of the function appears to be related to parsing a request and constructing a byte string `s` based on the parsed request values.

Looking at the input parameters and variables right before the function's return, it seems that the function is correctly parsing the input request and constructing the byte string `s` appropriately based on the parsed request values in both cases.

Therefore, the reason for the discrepancy in the test cases might not lie in the core logic of the function itself, but possibly in how the input requests are being generated or how the test cases are being evaluated. This could include issues such as incorrect comparison of expected vs actual output, or incorrect initialization of the input parameters for the function.

Further analysis of the test cases and how they are being evaluated is needed to identify the actual cause of the failing tests.


1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The failing test
   (c). The corresponding error message
   (d). Discrepancies between actual input/output variable value

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
