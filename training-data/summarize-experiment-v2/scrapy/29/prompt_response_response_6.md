# The buggy function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Fix: Added `or ''` to handle NoneType
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

By adding `or ''` to handle `NoneType`, we can fix the potential TypeError that is being raised in the `request_httprepr` function.

Updated the function to handle `NoneType` for `parsed.hostname` by using `or ''` to ensure that `to_bytes` does not receive a `NoneType` value.

This fixed function should now pass the failing test:
```python
def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
    # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
    request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
    request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```
