The issue with the buggy function is that the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` in some cases, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to throw a TypeError. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value instead.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function should handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, providing a default value of `b"localhost"` for the hostname. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring.
