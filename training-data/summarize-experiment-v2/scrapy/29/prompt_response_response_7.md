The issue in the `request_httprepr` function seems to be related to the `parsed.hostname` value being `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` when it tries to convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, we can simply check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before concatenating it with the byte string.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This version of the `request_httprepr` function includes a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it in the byte string concatenation.

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function should now handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
