The potential error in the problematic function is in the line where the path is constructed using `urlunparse`. It uses the parsed URL's scheme, which may not always be "HTTP". This is the cause of the bug, as it incorrectly constructs the HTTP request string. Additionally, the function does not include the "User-Agent" header and other potential headers commonly included in an HTTP request.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the HTTP request string by explicitly using "HTTP/1.1", including the "Host" header with the appropriate value, and including other relevant headers if they are present in the request.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('http', parsed.netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        if b'User-Agent' not in request.headers:
            request.headers[b'User-Agent'] = [b'Scrapy']
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"User-Agent: Scrapy\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function will now construct the HTTP request string correctly with the "HTTP/1.1" protocol and include the "Host" header with the appropriate value. Additionally, it includes the "User-Agent" header if it is not already present in the request.
