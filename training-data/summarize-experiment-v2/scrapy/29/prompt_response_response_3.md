The issue with the buggy function is that the `parsed.hostname` is not handling the case when the hostname is empty or `None`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is empty or `None` before attempting to concatenate it with the `b"Host: "`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Handle the case when hostname is not empty or None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code includes a check for `parsed.hostname` before attempting to concatenate it with `b"Host: "`, ensuring that it's not empty or `None` before converting it to bytes.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without any errors.
