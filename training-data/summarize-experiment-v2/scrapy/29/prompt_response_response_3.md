The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. This line is trying to concatenate the "Host" header with the result of `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)`, which is causing a TypeError when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

This issue could be fixed by checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check before adding the "Host" header to the byte string `s` to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Add a conditional check for parsed.hostname
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function adds a conditional check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding the "Host" header to the byte string `s`. This fix should prevent the TypeError that was occurring and the function should now pass the failing test.
