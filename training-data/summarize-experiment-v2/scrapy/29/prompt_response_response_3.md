The error is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`, which is passed to the `to_bytes` function, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

This issue occurs because for non-HTTP URLs, such as `file://` or `ftp://`, the `urlparse_cached` function returns `None` for `parsed.hostname`. 

To fix this issue, we need to handle non-HTTP URLs differently in the `request_httprepr` function. We can simply check if the scheme is not `http` before constructing the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    # check if the scheme is not HTTP
    if parsed.scheme != 'http':
        host = b""
    else:
        host = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    s += host
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this change, the function will now handle non-HTTP URLs correctly and should pass the failing test.
