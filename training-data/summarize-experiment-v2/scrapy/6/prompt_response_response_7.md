The bug seems to be in the `convert_image` function, specifically in the section where it deals with images of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It attempts to convert such images to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. However, it then saves the converted image as a JPEG without maintaining the alpha channel, resulting in the loss of transparency.

To fix this, the function should check for the presence of an alpha channel in the original image before converting it to RGB and saving it as a JPEG. If the image has an alpha channel, it should be saved as a PNG to preserve transparency.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if 'A' in image.getbands():  # Check if image has an alpha channel
            image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB
        else:
            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, format='PNG')  # Save as PNG to preserve transparency
            return image, buf
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the function will now correctly handle images with alpha channels and preserve transparency when saving images in the 'PNG' format. This should address the failing test cases.
