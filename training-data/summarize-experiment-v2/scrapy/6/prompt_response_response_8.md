The potential error in the provided buggy function lies in the incorrect condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB' and the issue with applying the thumbnail size to the image.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect if condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. Also, the test is failing due to unexpected output values, which could be a result of incorrect image processing within the function.

To fix the bug, the if condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB' needs to be corrected. Additionally, the logic for applying the thumbnail size to the image should be reviewed to ensure it provides the correct output size.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
