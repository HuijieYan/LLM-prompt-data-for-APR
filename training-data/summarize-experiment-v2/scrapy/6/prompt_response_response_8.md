The bug in the code is with the `convert` method. When trying to convert `RGBA` images to `RGB`, it's not working as intended. This is causing the failing test cases. The function should be modified to handle this conversion correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to correctly handle the conversion of `RGBA` images to `RGB`. We also need to ensure that the actual output matches the expected output for all the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO


class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image.split()[-1])  # Paste the alpha channel
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the failing test cases should pass and the function should produce the expected output for all test cases.
