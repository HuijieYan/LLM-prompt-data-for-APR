Based on the analysis, the buggy function `convert_image` has multiple issues related to image format conversion, resizing, and mode changes. To fix the issues, the following changes need to be made:

1. Correctly resize the image to the specified size.
2. Ensure that the image mode is correctly changed to 'RGB' when needed.
3. Fix the background handling to ensure proper conversion and mode changes.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle the image format conversion, resizing, and mode changes. It will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
