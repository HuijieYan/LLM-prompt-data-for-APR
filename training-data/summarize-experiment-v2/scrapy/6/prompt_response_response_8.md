The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conditional statements for converting PNG images with RGBA mode. Based on the failing test and the expected values, it appears that when the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the function is mishandling the conversion, leading to incorrect output.

The failing test indicates that the function is not converting the RGBA mode PNG image as expected, resulting in the `getcolors()` method returning an unexpected value. The issue likely lies in the conditional statements for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. 

To fix this bug, the conditional block for PNG format with RGBA mode should be updated to properly handle the conversion of such images. 

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly and pass the failing test cases.
