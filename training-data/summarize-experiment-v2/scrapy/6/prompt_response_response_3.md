The potential error location within the problematic function is the if condition for checking the format and mode of the image. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the resizing logic when a size parameter is provided.

The bug is likely caused by incorrectly checking the format and mode of the image, incorrect resizing logic, as well as a mistake in the paste operation inside the condition for converting from PNG and RGBA to RGB.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the if condition for checking the format and mode of the image.
2. Verify the resizing logic to ensure the correct output size.
3. Fix the paste operation inside the condition for converting from PNG and RGBA to RGB.

Here's the corrected code for the convert_image function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.format != 'JPEG':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This code should pass the failing test and provide the expected input/output variable information.
