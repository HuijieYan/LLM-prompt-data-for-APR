The issue with the buggy code is that when trying to convert an RGBA image to RGB, the conversion is not working as intended. Additionally, there are some mistakes in the conditional checks for image format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks for image format and mode, and fix the conversion process of RGBA to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
