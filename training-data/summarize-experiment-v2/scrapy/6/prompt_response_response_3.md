After analyzing the provided code and the failing test, it has been determined that the buggy function `convert_image` is not correctly handling the image format conversion, resizing, and mode change. 

The potential error location within the function is where the image format is being handled, specifically in the logic for resizing and mode change.

To fix the bug in the function, the logic for image format conversion, resizing, and mode change needs to be thoroughly reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the function should handle the background image properly when converting images.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from PIL import ImageOps

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the image format conversion, resizing, and mode change, and should pass the failing test case.
