The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is related to the image format conversion, resizing, mode change, and background handling logic.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Implement the correct resizing logic to ensure that the image is resized to the specified size.
2. Ensure that the image mode is correctly changed to 'RGB' when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
3. Properly handle the conversion of image mode from 'P' to 'RGB' and ensure that the background image is handled correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

The corrected code addresses the issues related to image format conversion, resizing, mode change, and background handling in the `convert_image` function. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
