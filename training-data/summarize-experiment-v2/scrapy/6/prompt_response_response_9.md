The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of images with an RGBA mode. 

When the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA image with a white background and then pastes the input image onto the new background. However, it should be noted that the `paste` method expects a box, not an image, as its second argument. This is likely causing the error in the test case where an image with RGBA mode is converted to RGB.

To fix this issue, the `paste` method should be called with the `(0, 0)` coordinate tuple, which specifies the upper left corner of the image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle images with RGBA mode correctly, and the failing test should pass.
