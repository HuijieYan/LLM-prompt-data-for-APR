In case 1, the function should return the image as it is since the format is already 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB', so no conversion is needed.

In case 2, the function should resize the image to the specified size while maintaining the aspect ratio and return the resized image.

In case 3, the function should convert the image from RGBA to RGB and return the converted image.

In case 4, the function should convert the image from mode 'P' to 'RGB' and return the converted image.

It seems that there are several issues in the function: 
- The condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB' is incorrect. It should be `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` instead of `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`.
- The thumbnail size is not being correctly applied to the image, leading to an unexpected output.

These issues should be corrected to satisfy all the expected cases.
