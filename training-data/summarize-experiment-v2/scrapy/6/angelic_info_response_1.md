The disrepancy in the failing test cases occurs because the function is not correctly handling the transformation of the input image. In cases 1 and 2, the function is expected to resize the image to the specified size, but it is not doing so. Instead, it should return an image with the new size and mode specified. Additionally, in case 3, the function should also be changing the mode of the input image to RGB, but it is not doing so. Finally, in case 4, the function should be converting the image from mode 'P' to mode 'RGB', but it is not.

The reason for the discrepancy is that the function is not correctly implementing the logic to resize and convert the images as expected by the test cases. The function needs to be modified to correctly perform the image transformation operations as specified in the test cases.
