The potential error in the buggy function is due to incorrect conditions for image format and mode checks, as well as problems with the resizing logic. Additionally, the paste operation in the first if statement should be reviewed to ensure it correctly combines the original image with the new background.

To fix the bug, the code for checking the format and mode of the image needs to be corrected. The resizing logic should also be reviewed and adjusted to ensure it correctly applies the size parameter. Additionally, the paste operation in the first if statement should be modified to correctly combine the original image with the new background.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these fixes, the convert_image function should now correctly handle the conversion of images based on their format and mode, as well as correctly apply the size parameter for resizing. This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
