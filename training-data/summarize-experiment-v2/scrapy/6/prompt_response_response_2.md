The buggy function has several issues related to image format conversion, resizing, and mode change. The function is not correctly handling the transformation of the input image as expected by the test cases. It also fails to correctly convert the image mode from 'P' to 'RGB' and does not handle the background image properly.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Correct the image resizing logic to ensure that the final image has the specified size.
2. Ensure that the image is correctly converted to the 'RGB' mode when necessary.
3. Handle the background image properly when there are transparency issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the image format conversion, resizing, mode change, and background handling, and should pass the failing test cases.
