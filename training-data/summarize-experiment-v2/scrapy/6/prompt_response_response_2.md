The issue in the `convert_image` function lies in the section that handles images in RGBA format. In the first part of the conditional statement, when the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image on top of it, then converts the image to RGB. This process removes the transparency from the image, which is why the tests are failing.

To fix the function, a check for transparency should be added before converting the image to RGB. If the image has an alpha channel, it should be converted to an RGBA image with a white background to preserve the transparency.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will handle RGBA images correctly, preserving the transparency and preventing the tests from failing.
