### Bug Cause Analysis

- The error occurs when the convert_image function is called with images of different formats and modes.
- In Case 2 of the failing test, the function fails to maintain the image ratio while creating a thumbnail.
- In Case 3, the function fails to handle transparency and convert RGBA to RGB properly.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of image format and mode conversions.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Make sure to handle RGBA images properly when converting them to RGB.
2. Ensure that creating thumbnails maintains the image ratio.
3. Handle the transparency properly when converting images to a different mode/format.

### Corrected Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected code ensures proper handling of RGBA images by using the alpha channel as a mask when pasting onto a new RGB background. It also ensures that creating thumbnails maintains the image ratio.

This should fix the issues reported in the failing test cases.
