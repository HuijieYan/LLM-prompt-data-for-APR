The issue with the `convert_image` function is that the conversion from RGBA to RGB is not done correctly. Additionally, the thumbnail size is not being applied as expected. The function should be fixed to correctly convert the image and apply the thumbnail size.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function fixes the issues with incorrect RGBA to RGB conversion and applies the correct thumbnail size. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
