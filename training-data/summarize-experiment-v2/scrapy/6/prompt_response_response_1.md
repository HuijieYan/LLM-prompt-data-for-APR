The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the way transparency is handled when converting images. 

In the failing test, when the input image has a mode of "RGBA" and a format of "PNG", the function is creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on top of it. This operation is meant to handle transparency, but it appears to be causing unexpected behavior, resulting in a different set of colors than expected.

Additionally, when the input image mode is "P" (which represents a color-mapped image), the function is also producing unexpected results, likely due to the same issue with transparency handling.

To fix the bug, you can modify the way transparency is handled when the input image is in "RGBA" mode, and handle color-mapped images differently as well. The `paste` operation with a white background may not be effectively handling transparency, so an alternative approach may be needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with an opaque white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the new background
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the image to RGB format
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB format
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code should now handle transparency properly for images in "RGBA" mode and handle color-mapped images more effectively, thus passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
