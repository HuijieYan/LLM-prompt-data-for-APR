The original error message is long and may appear confusing. The major problem in the buggy source code is the `convert` method. It tries to convert `RGBA` images to `RGB`, but the conversion is not working as intended. Similarly, the buggy file is located at "scrapy/pipelines/images.py", and the relative path for the test file is "tests/test_pipeline_images.py". Moreover, the most relevant information is the "Lists differ" suggesting that the expected result and the actual result of the test are different and the failure in the comparison has caused the issue.

The simplified error message is:

"Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]"

And the locations closely related to the fault are lines of code in the test file with the failing assertions specifically at:
- Line 105: `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`

This points to the definite discrepancy in the expected and actual outcomes.
