This is an actual error message from a failing test. The meaningful part of the error message is:

```text
msg = 'Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]\n\nFirst differing element 0:\n(10000, (0, 127, ..., 230, 255))\n\n- [(10000, (0, 127, 255))]\n?             -----\n\n+ [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]\n?           +++++++\n'
```

This message is a comparison of two lists, and in this case, they are expected to be equal, but they are not. In particular, they disagree about the color of the image. The original error message is on the denser side with lots of details. We can simplify this as follows:

Simplified error message:
```text
ERROR: Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]. The expected and actual color values differ for the image.
