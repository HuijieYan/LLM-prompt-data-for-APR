The issue in the `convert_image` function is with the conversion of images. Specifically, when the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function is creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it, then converting it to 'RGB' format. However, in this scenario, it should retain the transparency of the original image.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' differently. Instead of creating a new background and pasting the original image onto it, we should directly convert the image to 'RGB', which will retain the transparency.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now properly handle the transparency of PNG images with RGBA mode, and the failing test should pass.
