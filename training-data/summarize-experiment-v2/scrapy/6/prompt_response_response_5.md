## Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class and is called by the failing test `test_convert_image`. The failing test indicates that the output of the `convert_image` method does not match the expected output. This test specifically checks for the mode and colors of the images after conversion. The error message shows a discrepancy between the expected colors and the actual colors of the images after conversion.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB', as well as the resizing logic, which seems to be providing an incorrect output size.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is incorrect and should be `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. Additionally, the resizing logic is not providing the correct output size, which is causing the discrepancy in the test cases.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the condition for converting from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB' should be corrected to `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. Additionally, the resizing logic should be carefully examined to ensure that it provides the correct output size. The paste operation in the first if statement should also be reviewed to ensure that it correctly combines the original image with the new background.

Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
