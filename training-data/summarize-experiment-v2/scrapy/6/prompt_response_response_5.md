Based on the analysis, the issue with the `convert_image` function is related to image format conversion, resizing, mode change, and background handling. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    
    # corrected version of the convert_image function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

The changes made to the function include:
1. When dealing with PNG images with RGBA mode, the background image is created with the 'RGB' mode, and the original image is pasted onto it. Then, the original image is set to the background image.
2. When the image mode is not 'RGB', the image is converted to 'RGB'.
3. Proper copying and resizing of the image are handled.

With these changes, the function should now correctly transform images as expected by the test cases.
