The buggy function 'convert_image' is designed to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. It has several conditional statements to handle different image formats and modes.

After analyzing the failing test and the actual input/output variable information, it is clear that the bug is occurring in the conditional statement that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. In this particular case, the expected value of the variable 'converted' is not equal to the actual value, leading to a failure in the test.

The cause of the bug is that when the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA image named 'background' and pastes the original image onto it. Then, it converts this 'background' image to 'RGB'. However, the original transparency information is lost in this process, which is causing the discrepancy in the test results.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the RGBA mode differently to retain transparency information. One way to achieve this is by using the `convert_alpha()` method to convert the image to true RGBA mode. After this conversion, the image can be converted to RGB mode while retaining the transparency information.

Here's the corrected code for the 'convert_image' function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert image to true RGBA mode
        image = image.convert_alpha()
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB while retaining transparency
        image = image.convert('RGB', background=(255, 255, 255))
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
