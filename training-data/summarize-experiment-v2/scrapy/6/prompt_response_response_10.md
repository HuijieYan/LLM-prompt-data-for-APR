Based on the analysis of the failing test and the buggy function, the main issue appears to be with the image conversion, resizing and mode change logic. The function is not correctly handling the transformations for different image modes and sizes, leading to discrepancies in the output.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Correct the image resizing logic to ensure that the image is resized to the expected size while maintaining the aspect ratio.
2. Ensure that the image mode is correctly changed to 'RGB' when the input image is in 'RGBA' or 'P' modes.
3. Handle the background image properly when converting from 'RGBA' to 'RGB'.
4. Update the function to return the corrected image and the buffer.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
