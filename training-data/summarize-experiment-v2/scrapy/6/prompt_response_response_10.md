from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# The corrected and fixed function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a background in RGB mode
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the RGB background
        image = background  # Set the image to the newly created RGB image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the final image to RGB before saving as JPEG
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The issue with the original function was that the background was being created in RGBA mode, and the original image was being pasted onto the background, resulting in unexpected color combinations. Additionally, the final image needed to be explicitly converted to RGB mode before saving to JPEG to ensure consistent results.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should now produce the expected results when tested.
