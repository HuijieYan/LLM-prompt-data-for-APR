Based on the failing test and the provided input/output variable information, it appears that the bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conditional logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The failing tests indicate that the conversion of RGBA mode images to RGB mode is not resulting in the expected colors.

The cause of the bug appears to be the conditional block that converts RGBA mode images to RGB mode. The use of the `background.paste(image, image)` line inside the conditional block seems to be incorrect, which is leading to unexpected colors in the converted image.

To fix the bug, consider the following approach:

1. Instead of using `background.paste(image, image)`, simply create a new instance of the `Image` class without pasting.

2. Use the `background` image as a reference to create a new instance of the `Image` class and then convert it to RGB mode.

3. Update the logic to handle RGBA to RGB conversion in a way that preserves the transparency correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with RGB mode and white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the input image onto the new background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the background to RGB mode
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
