The issue with the original function is that the conversion of RGBA images to RGB is not working as intended, leading to failing test cases. The image mode is not being handled correctly, and the conversion to RGB is problematic. To fix this, the `convert` method should be used to handle the conversion more accurately. Additionally, the check for the image mode should be updated to ensure the correct behavior for different image modes. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA' or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version should handle different image modes and their conversions more accurately, passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
