1. The buggy function is a method that checks if a table exists in a database. It takes the table name, database name, and an optional partition as input. It then runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table and returns a boolean value based on the result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block where the Hive command is being run to check for the existence of a partition.

3. The bug's cause is that the else block is not properly formatted and the Hive command is not being executed correctly. Additionally, the partition_spec method is being called without being defined in the code provided.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly format the Hive command in the else block to check for the existence of a partition.
   - Define the partition_spec method or replace it with the correct logic for generating the partition specification.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if partition:
            partition_condition = 'partition (%s)' % partition
        else:
            partition_condition = ''

        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_condition))

        return bool(stdout)
```
