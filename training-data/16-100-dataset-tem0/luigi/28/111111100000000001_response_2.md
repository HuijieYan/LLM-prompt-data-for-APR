1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table. It also calls the `partition_spec` function to get the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if `stdout` is not empty. It also seems that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly when `partition` is not None.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string.
   (b). The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly when `partition` is not None.
   (c). The `partition_spec` function is being called with the wrong arguments.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `stdout` is not empty when checking for table existence.
   - Correctly call the `run_hive_cmd` function when `partition` is not None.
   - Pass the correct arguments to the `partition_spec` function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```
