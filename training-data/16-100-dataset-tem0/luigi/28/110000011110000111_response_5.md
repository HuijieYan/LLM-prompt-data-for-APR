The buggy function is `table_exists` which is a method of a class. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database, and it takes into account the possibility of a partition. The failing test `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the behavior of the `table_exists` method under different scenarios. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the method is not returning the expected results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems that the comparison is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to the test failures.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This issue has been identified and discussed in the GitHub issue, where it is suggested that the comparison should be made case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` in a case insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing test. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion by making the comparison case insensitive.

The GitHub issue can be closed with the implementation of this fix, and it can be titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The detailed description can mention that the stdout is now being checked against the lowercase table name to avoid case sensitivity issues.
