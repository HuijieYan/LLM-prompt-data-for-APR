The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output of the hive command. This causes the comparison to fail when the table name is in a different case than the output.

To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output of the hive command. This can be achieved by using the `lower()` method on the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output of the hive command, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
