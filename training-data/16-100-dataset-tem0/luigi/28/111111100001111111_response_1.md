The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to ensure that it can correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of its case.

The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the table name and the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that it can correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of its case.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and its detailed description provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. The suggested fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and its detailed description also provide a clear and concise description of the issue and the proposed fix.

By implementing the suggested fix, the `table_exists` function will be able to correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.
