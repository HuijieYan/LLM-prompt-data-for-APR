The issue with the buggy function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function should be modified to make the comparison case insensitive.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This is in line with the GitHub issue, which suggests that the function should check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will now compare the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
