The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making it case insensitive.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
