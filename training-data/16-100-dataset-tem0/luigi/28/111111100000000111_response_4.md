1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is case sensitive, causing failures when checking for tables with capitalized names.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The comparison is case sensitive, leading to failures when the table name is in a different case than the output.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are not directly causing the bug, but they are used within the `table_exists` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.
   - Using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected code modifies the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
