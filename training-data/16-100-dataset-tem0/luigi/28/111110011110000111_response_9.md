The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database and partition. The failing test is checking for the case insensitivity of table names, and the error message indicates that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems that the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to the test failures.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This is evident from the failing test and the GitHub issue, which both highlight the need for case insensitivity in table existence checks.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This will address the failing test and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
