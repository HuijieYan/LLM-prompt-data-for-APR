The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block of the table_exists function. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the command string when partition is not None.

The bug's cause is that the function is not formatting the command string correctly when the partition is not None. This is causing the run_hive_cmd function to return unexpected results, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command string is formatted correctly when the partition is not None. We can achieve this by using the format method to construct the command string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the table_exists function should now pass the failing test.
