The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. The issue arises from the fact that the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are both checking for case insensitivity when calling the `table_exists` function. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected results when checking for table existence with different cases.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" further confirms that the problem is related to case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will resolve the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, and it should pass the failing test cases. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report.
