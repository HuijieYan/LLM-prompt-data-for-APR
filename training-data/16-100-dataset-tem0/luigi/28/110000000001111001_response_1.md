The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional statements. The function is not returning the correct values based on the conditions.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the conditions properly and is not returning the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the conditions and return the expected values.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
