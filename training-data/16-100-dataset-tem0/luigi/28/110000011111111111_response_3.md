The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The failing test is expecting the function to be case insensitive, but the function is currently case sensitive.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function is not converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output.

The failing test is expecting the function to be case insensitive, but the function is currently case sensitive. This is evident from the failing test message, which indicates that the function is not returning the expected results when the table name is in a different case.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and its detailed description provide additional context to the problem. It suggests that the function should check the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function returns the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. It should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
