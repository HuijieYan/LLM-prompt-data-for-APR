1. The buggy function is a method for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names when checking for their existence in Hive. The issue is that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failures when checking for tables with different case formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function does not account for case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The GitHub issue highlights that tables with different case formats are not being properly handled by the function, leading to failures in the check.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
   - Using a case-insensitive comparison method to check for the existence of the table.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check for table existence case insensitive. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
