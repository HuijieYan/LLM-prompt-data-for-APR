The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not calling the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions correctly. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without the `self` parameter, and the `partition_spec` function is being called as a method of `self` instead of directly.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the `self` parameter, and call the `partition_spec` function directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(self, 'use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(self, """use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
