The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which may result in a mismatch due to case differences.

The related GitHub issue suggests that the table_exists function should be made case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout, making the check case insensitive.

This corrected code satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
