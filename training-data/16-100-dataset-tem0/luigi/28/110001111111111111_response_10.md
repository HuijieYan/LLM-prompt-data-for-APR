The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name's case does not match the case of the table name returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.

This fix also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post, making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
