The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` within a class. The function takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition parameter. It then runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database and partition.

The failing test is testing the `table_exists` method by mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking the return values against expected outcomes. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the method is returning the wrong value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements. The function is not returning the correct values based on the conditions.

The bug's cause is that the function is not returning the correct values based on the conditions. It is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` and vice versa.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function returns the correct values based on the conditions. We can also simplify the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` method should now return the correct values based on the conditions and pass the failing test.
