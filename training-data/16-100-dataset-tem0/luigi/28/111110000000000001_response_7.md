1. The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It checks if a table exists in a given database, and if a partition is specified, it also checks if the partition exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if `stdout` is empty or not.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statement is not handling the case where `stdout` is empty properly. It is also not handling the case where a partition is specified correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `stdout` is not empty using `if stdout.strip()`, which will handle any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - Handle the case where a partition is specified by constructing the command properly and checking the output.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_cmd = ' '.join(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected code, we have added `strip()` to `stdout` to handle any leading or trailing whitespace. We have also constructed the partition command properly and checked if the `stdout` is not empty to determine if the partition exists.
