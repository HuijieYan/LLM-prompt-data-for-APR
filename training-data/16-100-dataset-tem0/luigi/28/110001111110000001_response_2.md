The potential error in the buggy function is in the `table_exists` function. The issue seems to be with the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and the condition for checking the existence of the table.

The `table_exists` function is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database. The first issue is with the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called. It is not being imported or defined within the `luigi.contrib.hive` module, so it needs to be imported or defined properly.

The second issue is with the condition for checking the existence of the table. The function is returning the output of `run_hive_cmd` and checking if the table name is in the output. However, the condition is not handling the case where the table does not exist properly.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly imported or defined within the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. Additionally, the condition for checking the existence of the table needs to be modified to handle the case where the table does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, the output of `run_hive_cmd` is split by newline character and then checked if the table name is in the output. Additionally, the condition for the existence of the table is simplified to return the boolean value of `stdout`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
