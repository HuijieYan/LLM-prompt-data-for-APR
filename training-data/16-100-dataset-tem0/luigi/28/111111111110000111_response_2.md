The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test because it is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The failing test is expecting the function to be case insensitive, but the function is currently case sensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not converting the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout. This will make the function case insensitive and satisfy the expectations of the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository. The GitHub issue title "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and the detailed description "Check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues" accurately describe the fix.
