1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a case sensitivity problem when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the `stdout` from the Hive command. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests a solution to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to account for case insensitivity.
   - Update the function to use a case-insensitive comparison method to check for the existence of the table.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of `stdout` with the table name has been modified to use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
