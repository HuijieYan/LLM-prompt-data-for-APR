1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the function is not handling this case properly. The failing test is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns=None`, which triggers the `TypeError` because the function is not handling the `None` case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
   - If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately, for example, by setting `colnames` to an empty string.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
