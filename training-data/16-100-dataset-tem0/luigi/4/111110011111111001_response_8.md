The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which cannot be used with the `len` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `self.columns` attribute is being set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, and the buggy function is not handling this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
