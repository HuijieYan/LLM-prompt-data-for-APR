1. The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The issue is related to the `self.columns` attribute, which is used to determine the column names for the COPY command. The GitHub issue indicates that when `columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the Redshift COPY job fails in luigi 2.7.1.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   This line is causing the TypeError when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `copy` is trying to construct the `colnames` variable by joining the column names from `self.columns`. However, when `self.columns` is set to `None`, it causes a TypeError.
   (b). The `S3CopyToTable` class inherits from `_CredentialsMixin` and contains the `copy_options` function, which is called within the `copy` function.
   (c). The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are also present in the same file but not in the same class. They are called within the `copy` function.
   (d). The GitHub issue information confirms that the bug is related to the handling of `self.columns` when it is set to `None`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use it in the `copy` function.
   - Provide a default value for `self.columns` if it is not provided.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition is added to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use it. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` function is called with parentheses to execute it. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
