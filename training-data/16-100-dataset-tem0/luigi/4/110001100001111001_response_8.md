The bug in the provided function is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called as functions, but they are actually methods of the class. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is not being used in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` methods without parentheses and include the `colnames` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials,
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `self._credentials` and `self.copy_options` are called as methods, and the `colnames` variable is included in the `cursor.execute` statement. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
