The bug in the provided function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This is in line with the error message from the failing test, which indicates that the TypeError is raised due to `self.columns` being of type 'NoneType'.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
