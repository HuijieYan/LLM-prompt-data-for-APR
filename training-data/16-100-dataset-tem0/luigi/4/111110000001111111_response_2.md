The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The issue arises when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

The bug's cause is that the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes the function to fail when trying to get the length of `None`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring. This fix also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
