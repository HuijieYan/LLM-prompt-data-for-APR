The bug in the provided code is caused by the comparison of the 'self.columns' variable with the integer 0. When 'self.columns' is None, the comparison 'len(self.columns) > 0' raises a TypeError because NoneType does not have a len() method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to check if 'self.columns' is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the comparison 'if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0' ensures that 'self.columns' is not None before checking its length, preventing the TypeError.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
