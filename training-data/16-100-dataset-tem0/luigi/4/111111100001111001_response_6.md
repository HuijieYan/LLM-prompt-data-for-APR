The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `self.copy_options` without calling the function. It should be `self.copy_options()` to actually call the function and get its return value.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` function. The function is not being called with `()` at the end, which means it is not actually being executed to provide the necessary options for the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and use its return value as the options for the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be called and its return value will be used as the options for the `COPY` command, which should fix the bug.
