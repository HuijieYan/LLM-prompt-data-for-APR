Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, then calling len(self.columns) will result in a TypeError.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is attempting to check the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns is not None.
(b). The related functions _credentials and copy_options are not directly related to the bug, but they are called within the buggy function.
(c). The GitHub issue information indicates that the bug occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation, resulting in a TypeError due to the length check on self.columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the if statement to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected code includes a check for self.columns before attempting to check its length, which addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
