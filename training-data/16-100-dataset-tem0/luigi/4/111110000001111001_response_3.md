The potential error in the buggy function is in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self.copy_options` variable is not being called as a function, which is causing the bug.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function. The `copy_options` function should be called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and concatenate the result with the query string.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` with parentheses, we ensure that the `copy_options` function is executed and its result is included in the `COPY` command query string. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
