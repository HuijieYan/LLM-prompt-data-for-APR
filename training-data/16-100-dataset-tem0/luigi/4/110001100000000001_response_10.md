1. The buggy function is a part of a larger codebase for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It calls two other functions from the same file, `_credentials` and `copy_options`, to retrieve credentials and copy options, respectively.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` without calling them as functions.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are not being called correctly within the `copy` function. They should be called as methods of the class using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions as methods of the class using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`.
   - Ensure that the return values of these functions are correctly formatted for the `cursor.execute` statement.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called as methods of the class using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`. This should fix the bug and allow the `cursor.execute` statement to be executed correctly.
