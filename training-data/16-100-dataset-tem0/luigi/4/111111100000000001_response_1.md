The potential error location within the problematic function is in the cursor.execute() method call. The issue is with the usage of self.copy_options, which is a method, but it is not being called with parentheses. This will result in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to call the copy_options method with parentheses to execute it and get the result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, the copy_options method is called with parentheses to execute it and get the result. This should fix the bug and prevent the TypeError.
