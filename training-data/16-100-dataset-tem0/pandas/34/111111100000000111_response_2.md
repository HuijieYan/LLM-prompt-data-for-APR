1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is related to other functions within the same class, such as `_adjust_bin_edges`, and also calls the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function from the same file. The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` due to the handling of time intervals on the clock change day.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in the `_get_time_bins` function. This causes the `pd.Grouper` to raise an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue is related to the behavior of the `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba, as described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function.
   - Ensuring that the time intervals are calculated correctly, especially on the clock change day.
   - Checking for any edge cases related to time zone changes and ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly
    if ax.tz is not None:
        binner = binner.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")
        labels = labels.tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="infer")

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles ambiguous timestamps by using the `tz_localize` method and ensures that time intervals are calculated correctly, especially on the clock change day in Cuba. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
