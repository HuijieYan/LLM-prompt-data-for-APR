The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time zone information and the creation of date ranges. The error message indicates that an ambiguous time error is being raised, which suggests that the time zone information is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the time zone information is preserved and that date ranges are created appropriately.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the creation of the `binner` and `labels` date ranges to explicitly specify the time zone information and handle ambiguous times. Additionally, the function should ensure that the time zone information is preserved when creating the `binner` and `labels` date ranges.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the `binner` and `labels` date ranges are explicitly given the time zone information from the input `ax`. Additionally, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times appropriately.

This corrected code should address the issues with time zone handling and date range creation, and it should allow the function to pass the failing test.
