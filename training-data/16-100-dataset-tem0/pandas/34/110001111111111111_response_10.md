The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` method is called on a DataFrame with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises because the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

The bug is likely located in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables, which are used to create the bins for the groupby operation. The function is not correctly handling the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, leading to the ambiguous time error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for creating the `binner` and `labels` variables to account for the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and allowing the `groupby` operation to work as expected on clock change days in Cuba.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` passes successfully.
