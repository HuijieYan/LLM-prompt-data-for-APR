The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly converting the data to a date format and returning the correct boolean value for whether the parsing was successful.

The potential error location is in the section where it checks if the data type is "object" and tries to convert it to "int64". It also has issues with checking if the numbers are in range.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the conversion of data to a date format and not returning the correct boolean value for whether the parsing was successful.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly convert the data to a date format using the pandas `to_datetime` function and handle the boolean value for parsing success separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # convert to datetime
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        success = True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        success = False

    return new_data, success
```

This corrected code should now correctly convert the data to a date format and return the boolean value for whether the parsing was successful, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
