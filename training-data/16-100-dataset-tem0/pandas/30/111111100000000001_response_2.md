1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the `if new_data.dtype == "object"` block where it tries to convert the data to `int64`. There could also be potential issues with the `date_units` loop and the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of data types and conversion, as well as potential issues with the date parsing logic.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the data type conversion logic and handling it appropriately.
   - Ensuring that the date parsing logic is robust and can handle different date units and formats.
   - Adding proper error handling and logging to identify any issues during the parsing process.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the `new_data` variable is properly assigned the result of the `astype` function. Additionally, the `to_datetime` function is now properly enclosed within the `try-except` block to handle any potential errors during date parsing.
