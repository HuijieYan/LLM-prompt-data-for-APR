1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for converting data to date columns, which is causing the unexpected behavior when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of data to date using the `to_datetime` function. This is where the unexpected behavior is likely occurring.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert boolean values to dates, which is not the expected behavior when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, where the expected output is a Pandas Series of bools, but the function is returning a Series of timestamps or raising an exception.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type before attempting to convert to date and handling boolean values separately.
   - Modifying the function to return a Series of bools when the input data is a list of bools.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check for boolean values and returns the original data with a boolean flag if the input data is of boolean type. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
