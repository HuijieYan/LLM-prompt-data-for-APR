The bug in the function is that it is not correctly converting the data to a date column. The function is trying to convert the data to int64 dtype, but it is not handling the RangeIndex and Series types correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the RangeIndex and Series types separately and convert them to the correct date format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(new_data, pd.RangeIndex):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, unit='s', origin='unix')
    elif isinstance(new_data, pd.Series):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce', unit='s', origin='unix')

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected code handles the RangeIndex and Series types separately and converts them to the correct date format. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
