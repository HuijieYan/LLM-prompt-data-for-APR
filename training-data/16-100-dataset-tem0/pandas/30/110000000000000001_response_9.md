1. The buggy function is intended to convert a ndarray into a date column by parsing it into epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the new_data variable and the conversion to date using the to_datetime function.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the conversion to date properly, and there are potential issues with the data type checks and conversions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the data type of new_data before attempting to convert it to int64
   - Handle the conversion to date using to_datetime more effectively
   - Ensure that the function returns the correct data and a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the new_data variable is handled more effectively, and the conversion to date using to_datetime is properly handled within the for loop. The function now returns the correct data and a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.
