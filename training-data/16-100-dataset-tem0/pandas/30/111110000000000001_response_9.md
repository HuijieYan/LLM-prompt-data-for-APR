1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class. It is intended to convert data into a date column, handling different data types and formats. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the new_data variable and the date conversion process.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the mishandling of data types and the date conversion process within the function. The function is not properly handling different data types and formats, leading to potential errors in the date conversion process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly handling different data types and formats before attempting date conversion.
   - Implementing error handling and validation for the date conversion process.
   - Ensuring that the function returns the correct data and a boolean indicating the success of the conversion.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the handling of different data types and formats has been improved, and error handling for the date conversion process has been implemented. The function now returns the correct data and a boolean indicating the success of the conversion.
