1. The buggy function is a method within the PeriodIndex class. It is a cache_readonly function that returns the _engine_type with a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to self is not being properly handled, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential memory leaks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self.
   - Ensuring that the weak reference is properly handled and does not lead to circular references or memory leaks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
