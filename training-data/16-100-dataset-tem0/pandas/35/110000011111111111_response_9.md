The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type based on the input parameters. However, the function is not correctly handling the weak reference to the input parameter 'self'. This is causing the 'PeriodEngine' to receive a NoneType object instead of the expected 'PeriodIndex'.

The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if the levels are monotonic. However, due to the bug in the _engine method, it is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a NoneType object.

The expected input parameter value and type are provided, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is expected that the function should return the engine type based on the input 'self'.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides a detailed description of the problem. It mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the weak reference to the input parameter 'self' and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference to 'self' is correctly handled by calling the weak reference object as a function 'period()'. This ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
