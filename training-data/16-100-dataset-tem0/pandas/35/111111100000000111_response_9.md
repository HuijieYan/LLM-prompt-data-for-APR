1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and its length.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and its usage in the `_engine_type` constructor.

3. The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the usage in the `_engine_type` constructor.
   - Check for any premature dropping of the weak reference.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._period = period  # Maintain the weak reference
    return engine
```

In the corrected code, we maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` by assigning it to the `_period` attribute of the `engine` instance. This ensures that the weak reference is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
