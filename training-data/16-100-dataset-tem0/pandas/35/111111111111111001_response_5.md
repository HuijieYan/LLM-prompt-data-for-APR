The issue in the buggy function is that the `_engine_type` attribute is not being properly initialized. This is causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called on the `PeriodEngine` object.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized with the correct values.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_type
```

With this change, the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized with the `PeriodEngine` object, and the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
