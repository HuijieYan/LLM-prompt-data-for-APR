1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is used to create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` to it. The issue on GitHub is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` resulting in the loss of weakrefs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference creation and passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to the loss of weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
   (b). The `PeriodIndex` class is not handling weak references correctly, causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended.
   (c). The GitHub issue information highlights that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely.
   - Check the lifecycle of the weak reference and ensure it is valid when used by the `PeriodEngine`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This should address the issue of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
