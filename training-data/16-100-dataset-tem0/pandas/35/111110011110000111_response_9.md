The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it raises an error due to the weak reference issue.

The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem accurately. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function needs to be handled properly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference implementation or by using a different approach to avoid the weak reference issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer valid")
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to `self` is still valid before creating the `PeriodEngine`. If the weak reference is no longer valid, it raises a `RuntimeError` to handle the case. This approach resolves the weak reference issue and should pass the failing test while also addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
