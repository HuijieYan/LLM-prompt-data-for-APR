The issue seems to be with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized and returns the expected type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

This code checks if the `_engine_type` returns `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it does. This ensures that the `_engine` function always returns a valid engine object.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
