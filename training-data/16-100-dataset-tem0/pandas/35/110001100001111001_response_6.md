The issue with the buggy function is that it is using weakref.ref() incorrectly. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object, but it needs to be dereferenced in order to access the actual object. Additionally, the _engine_type function is being called with incorrect arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to the _engine_type function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to the _engine_type function, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
