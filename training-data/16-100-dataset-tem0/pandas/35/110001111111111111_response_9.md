The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

The GitHub issue also mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, the weak reference of the PeriodIndex should be handled properly in the _engine function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference of the PeriodIndex and ensure that it is still valid when passed to the _engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference of the PeriodIndex is properly handled by calling period() to obtain the referenced object before passing it to the _engine_type.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the _engine function to work as expected and pass the failing test.
