1. The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. This function is used to create an engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the level values are monotonic, but it fails with an AttributeError related to the `PeriodEngine` class.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or is returning a `NoneType` object.

3. The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type. This is likely due to an issue with the initialization of the `_engine_type` or the way it is being used within the `_engine` function. The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `PeriodEngine`, but it fails with an AttributeError because the `PeriodEngine` is a `NoneType` object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the initialization of the `_engine_type` and ensuring it returns a valid engine type.
   - Verifying that the `_engine_type` is being used correctly within the `_engine` function.
   - Ensuring that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine object instead of a `NoneType` object.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is not properly initialized")
    return engine
```

This corrected code ensures that the `_engine` function checks if the engine type is properly initialized and returns a valid engine object. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
