The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. This method is being used in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the `view` attribute.

The potential error location within the `_engine` method is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` method not returning the expected object, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned instead.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct object and does not result in a `NoneType` object being returned. This may involve debugging the `_engine_type` method to understand why it is returning `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method returned None")
```

This corrected code includes a check for the `_engine_type` method returning `None`, and raises a ValueError if that happens. This ensures that the `_engine` method does not return a `NoneType` object, which should resolve the AttributeError in the failing test.
