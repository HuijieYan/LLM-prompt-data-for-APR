1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type for a given object. The failing test is trying to check if the level values of a MultiIndex are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'view' attribute.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the expected type of object, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

3. The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` method not returning the expected type of object, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure it returns the correct type of object.
   - Verifying that the arguments passed to `_engine_type` are correct and valid.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, the `@cache_readonly` decorator has been replaced with `@lru_cache` from the `functools` module. This change ensures that the `_engine` function is memoized and the correct result is returned. This should address the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
