The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it fails with a `NoneType` error.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" suggests that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being lost when creating a `MultiIndex` from it.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` needs to be properly handled in the `_engine` function so that it is not lost when creating a `MultiIndex` from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly handled, and if it is `None`, it returns `None` instead of trying to access attributes on a `NoneType` object.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
