The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This is intended to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to use a regular reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this change, the function should now return the expected output for the given input.
