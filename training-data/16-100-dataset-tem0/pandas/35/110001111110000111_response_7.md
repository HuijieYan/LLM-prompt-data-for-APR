The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but it fails due to the weak reference issue.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revised to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the proper reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.core.computation.cache import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference issue should be resolved, and the failing test should pass. This also addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
