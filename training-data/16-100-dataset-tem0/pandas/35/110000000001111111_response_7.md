The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex, which is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely due to the weakref.ref() call not being used correctly in the _engine function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) call, which is intended to create a weak reference to the self object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to self is not being properly passed to the _engine_type function, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is properly passed to the _engine_type function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that a weak reference to self is properly passed to the _engine_type function, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
