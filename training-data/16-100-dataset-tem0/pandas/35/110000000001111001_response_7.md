The issue with the buggy function is that it is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not defined in the provided code. This is likely causing the function to not work as expected.

To fix the bug, we can remove the decorator and use a simple function to achieve the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and satisfy the provided input/output variable information.
