1. The buggy function is a decorator called `@cache_readonly` that is applied to the `_engine` method. The function is supposed to return a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to avoid a reference cycle. The GitHub issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` which loses weakrefs, causing an error when checking if the levels are monotonic.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to create a new `PeriodIndex`.

3. The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the error when checking if the levels are monotonic.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` method.
   - Check for any premature dropping of the weak reference.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `cache_readonly` decorator is defined to maintain a cached result of the `_engine` method. The weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` within the `_engine` method, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained throughout the execution. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
