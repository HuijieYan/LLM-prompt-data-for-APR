The issue seems to be related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if the levels are monotonic. This fails with an `AttributeError` because the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` needs to be maintained properly in the `_engine` function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used to create the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. Additionally, this correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
