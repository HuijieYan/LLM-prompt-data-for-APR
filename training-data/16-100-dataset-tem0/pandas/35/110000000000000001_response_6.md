1. The buggy function is a decorator function that is supposed to cache the result of the _engine function and return the cached result on subsequent calls.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the @cache_readonly decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

3. The bug's cause is that the @cache_readonly decorator is not defined, so the function is not actually being cached as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the @cache_readonly decorator to properly cache the result of the _engine function.
   - Use a different caching mechanism, such as functools.lru_cache, to achieve the desired caching behavior.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import functools

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_value = None
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal cached_value
        if cached_value is None:
            cached_value = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return cached_value
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have defined the cache_readonly decorator using functools.wraps and a closure to cache the result of the _engine function. This will ensure that the result is cached and returned on subsequent calls to the _engine function.
