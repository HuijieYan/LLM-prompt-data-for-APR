The bug is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended to. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref. This will create a weak proxy to the PeriodIndex object, allowing it to be accessed as if it were a normal reference, but still maintaining the weak reference behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex will be maintained until it is no longer needed, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
