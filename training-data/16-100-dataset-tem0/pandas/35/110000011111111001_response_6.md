The buggy function is a property `_engine` that is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`. The function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with the input parameters `period` and `len(self)`. However, the error message indicates that the `_engine` property is returning a `NoneType` object, which means that the `_engine_type` is not being properly instantiated.

The failing test is related to the `PeriodIndex._engine` property, which is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` property should be modified to properly instantiate the `_engine_type` and return it. Additionally, the `@cache_readonly` decorator should be removed as it is not a standard Python decorator and might be causing issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

By checking if `self._engine_type` exists before instantiating it, we can prevent the `NoneType` object error. Additionally, removing the `@cache_readonly` decorator will prevent any potential issues related to caching.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
