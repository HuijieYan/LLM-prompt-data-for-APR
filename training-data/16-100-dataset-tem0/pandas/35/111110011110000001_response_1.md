1. The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `view` attribute of the `PeriodEngine` class, which is related to the `_engine` function.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the return statement. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the initialization of the `_engine_type` within the `_engine` function. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly instantiated or is returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This is causing the failing test to raise an error when checking for monotonicity.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the initialization of the `_engine_type` within the `_engine` function to ensure it is returning a valid object.
   - Verify that the `weakref.ref(self)` is being properly passed to the `_engine_type`.
   - Ensure that the `_engine_type` is returning a valid object with the necessary attributes.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

This corrected code checks if the `_engine_type` is returning a valid object and raises a ValueError if it is `None`. This should ensure that the failing test passes and the `_engine` function works as expected.
