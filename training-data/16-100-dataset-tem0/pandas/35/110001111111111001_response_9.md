The issue in the buggy function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly initializing `period`. This is causing an AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is called on the `PeriodEngine` object.

To fix this bug, we need to properly initialize the `period` variable before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By initializing `period` with `weakref.ref(self)` and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self._values`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is properly initialized and the AttributeError is avoided.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
