1. The buggy function is a property decorator that is supposed to cache the result of the `_engine` method. The failing test is trying to create a MultiIndex and check if the levels are monotonic, but it is encountering an AttributeError related to a NoneType object. The GitHub issue describes the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement, where it is trying to create a new instance of `_engine_type` using `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The bug's cause is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly maintained, leading to the `_engine` method receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the `_engine` method.
   - Check if the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, and if so, adjust the caching mechanism to retain the reference until it is no longer needed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and used to create the `_engine` instance. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
