The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

The problem seems to be with the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function, which is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before intended.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be handled properly to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected code, we are checking if the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not None before creating the PeriodEngine. This ensures that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
