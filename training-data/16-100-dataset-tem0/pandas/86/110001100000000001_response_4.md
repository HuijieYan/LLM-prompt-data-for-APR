1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for reshaping data using the pivot method. It takes in a DataFrame and performs the pivot operation based on the provided index, columns, and values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the values parameter is None. This conditional statement does not handle the case where index is None and columns is not None.

3. The bug's cause is that when index is None and columns is not None, the function does not handle this case properly and results in an error. This is because the function assumes that if values is None, then it can directly set the index using the columns, which may not be the case when index is also None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a conditional statement to handle the case where index is None and columns is not None.
   - Refactoring the code to handle the different combinations of index, columns, and values more effectively.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is None:
            raise ValueError("index cannot be None when values is None")
        else:
            indexed = data.set_index(index, append=True)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, a conditional statement has been added to handle the case where index is None and columns is not None. If this condition is met, a ValueError is raised to indicate that index cannot be None in this scenario.
