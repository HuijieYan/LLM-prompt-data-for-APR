1. The buggy function is the `equals` function, which is used to compare two DataFrames for equality. The related functions include `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, `dtype`, and `canonicalize`. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames and expects them to be unequal, but the assertion fails with the error message `assert True is False`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely in the comparison of the DataFrames and the sorting of the blocks.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the comparison of the DataFrames not working as expected, leading to the assertion failure. The error message indicates that the comparison is resulting in `True` instead of `False`, which is not the expected outcome.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the comparison logic in the `equals` function to ensure it correctly identifies differences between the DataFrames.
   - Checking the sorting of the blocks to ensure it is done in a way that preserves the original order and does not introduce unexpected changes.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The changes made include:
- Correcting the call to `as_array` by adding parentheses to `as_array()` to call the function.
- Ensuring that the `canonicalize` function correctly returns a tuple by calling `as_array()` and `tolist()` on `mgr_locs`.
- Using the corrected `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks.
- Ensuring that the comparison of the blocks is done using the `equals` method.

With these corrections, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
