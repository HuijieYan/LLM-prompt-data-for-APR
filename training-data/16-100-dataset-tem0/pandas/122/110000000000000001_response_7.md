1. The buggy function is a method that compares two objects for equality. It compares the axes and blocks of the two objects and returns False if they are not equal.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks and then compares them, but there may be unconsolidated blocks that are not being handled properly.

3. The bug's cause is that unconsolidated blocks are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for unconsolidated blocks and handle them appropriately before comparing the blocks.
   - Ensure that the comparison of the blocks takes into account any unconsolidated blocks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check for unconsolidated blocks and handle them appropriately
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```
