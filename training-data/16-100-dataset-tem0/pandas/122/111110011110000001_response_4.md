1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it is failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is likely in the comparison of the blocks. The method is trying to compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, but there seems to be an issue with the comparison logic.

3. (a). The buggy function: The `equals` method is responsible for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
   (b). The buggy class: The `BlockManager` class contains the `equals` method and is used to manage labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it is failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for comparing the blocks within the `equals` method.
   - Ensure that the comparison logic handles different data types and values correctly.
   - Check if the sorting and canonicalization of blocks is done correctly before comparison.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues with the comparison logic and ensures that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. This should allow the `equals` method to pass the failing test.
