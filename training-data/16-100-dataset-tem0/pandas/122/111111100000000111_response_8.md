1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. This comparison does not take into account the location of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects using the `equals` method, but it does not consider the locations of the blocks.
   (b). The `BlockManager` class contains methods such as `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` which are called within the `equals` method.
   (c). The `equals` method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality, but it does not handle the comparison of blocks with different locations correctly.
   (d). The GitHub issue information confirms that the `equals` method is returning `True` even when the blocks have different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to consider the locations of the blocks.
   - Update the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the comparison.
   - Ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account their order and location within the `BlockManager` objects.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's location (using `id(block)`) in the comparison. This ensures that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
