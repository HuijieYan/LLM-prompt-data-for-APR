The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is supposed to return a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`, but it is not doing so correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function returns the correct tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now correctly returns a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
