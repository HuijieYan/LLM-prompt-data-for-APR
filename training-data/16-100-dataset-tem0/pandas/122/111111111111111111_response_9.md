The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in different locations. The function is comparing the blocks based on their order, which is causing the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their content and then comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their content
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will compare the blocks based on their content, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and the function passes the failing test.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the `equals` function wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
