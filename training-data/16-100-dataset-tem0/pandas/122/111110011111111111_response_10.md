The bug is caused by the `equals` function not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing the blocks based on their order, which can lead to incorrect results when the blocks have the same content but are in different locations.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the blocks based on their content rather than their order. This can be achieved by sorting the blocks based on their content before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks based on their content before comparing
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
