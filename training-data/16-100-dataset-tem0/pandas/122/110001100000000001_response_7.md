1. The buggy function "equals" compares two objects and checks if they are equal. It calls the function "_consolidate_inplace" from the same file, but not the same class. The potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks of the two objects.

2. The potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks of the two objects.

3. The bug is caused by the comparison of the blocks not being properly sorted and compared. The function "canonicalize" is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it is not being called correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Call the "canonicalize" function correctly to sort the blocks before comparing them.
   - Ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done in a way that properly accounts for their type and manager locations.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function is called correctly with "block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()" to properly sort the blocks before comparing them. This should fix the bug in the "equals" function.
