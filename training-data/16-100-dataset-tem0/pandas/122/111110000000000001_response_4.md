1. The buggy function is a method within the BlockManager class. It compares the attributes of two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal. It does this by comparing the axes, consolidating the data, and then comparing the blocks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks and then compares them, but there may be a problem with the sorting or comparison process.

3. The bug's cause is that the comparison of the blocks may not be accurate due to the sorting process. The sorting may not be taking into account all relevant factors for determining equality.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the sorting and comparison process to ensure that all relevant factors are considered.
   - Checking for any inconsistencies in the data consolidation process that may affect the comparison.
   - Adding error handling to the comparison process to catch any discrepancies.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```
In the corrected code, after sorting the blocks, we added a check to ensure that the number of blocks in both BlockManager objects is the same. Then, we iterate through the sorted blocks and compare them one by one. If any pair of blocks is not equal, we return False. If all blocks are equal, we return True.
