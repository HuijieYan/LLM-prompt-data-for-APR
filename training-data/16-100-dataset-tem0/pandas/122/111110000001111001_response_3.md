The bug in the equals function is caused by the missing 'self' parameter in the canonicalize function. This causes the canonicalize function to be defined as a standalone function instead of a method of the BlockManager class. As a result, when it is called within the equals function, it does not have access to the necessary attributes of the BlockManager class.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function should be defined as a method of the BlockManager class by including the 'self' parameter. Additionally, the canonicalize function should be called using the 'self' parameter to ensure that it has access to the necessary attributes of the BlockManager class.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: self.canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: other.canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the canonicalize function is defined as a method of the BlockManager class and is called using the 'self' parameter, ensuring that it has access to the necessary attributes of the BlockManager class. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
