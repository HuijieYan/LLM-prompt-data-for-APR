1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, but it is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the test failure. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`. The GitHub issue also describes the problem as the `equals` method wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `equals` method is comparing blocks without considering their locations, leading to incorrect results.
   (b). The `BlockManager` class is the core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. It manages a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.
   (c). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, but it is returning `True` instead of `False`.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, including the expected output and the versions of pandas and other related libraries.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `equals` method to consider the locations of blocks when comparing them for equality.
   (b). Update the comparison logic to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
   (c). Test the modified `equals` method with various scenarios to ensure it returns the expected results.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes the modification to the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the locations of blocks. This should address the issue of identical blocks with different locations incorrectly being identified as equal. The corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
