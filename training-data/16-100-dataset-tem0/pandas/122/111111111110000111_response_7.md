The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it is returning `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not properly comparing the blocks of the dataframes, leading to incorrect results when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to take into account the order of the blocks.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the actual content of the blocks, not just their order.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now properly compare the blocks of the dataframes, taking into account their order and content. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
