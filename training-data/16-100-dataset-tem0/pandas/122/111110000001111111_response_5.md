The potential error in the buggy function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is not defined as a method of the `BlockManager` class, which causes the sorting to fail.

The bug's cause is that the `canonicalize` function is not defined within the `BlockManager` class, leading to a NameError when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the `block` variable should be accessed as an attribute of the `BlockManager` class.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Access the blocks as attributes of the BlockManager class
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
