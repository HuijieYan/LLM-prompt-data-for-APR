1. The buggy function is a method within the BlockManager class. It compares the equality of two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks. It also calls the _consolidate_inplace method from the same class and uses the canonicalize function from the same file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the equals method. There might be an issue with the comparison logic or the sorting of blocks.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect comparison logic or the sorting of blocks not being done properly. The _consolidate_inplace method is called to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparison. The canonicalize function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic of the comparison of blocks using the equals method.
   - Ensure that the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function is done correctly.
   - Verify that the _consolidate_inplace method is properly consolidating the blocks before comparison.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the canonicalize function is called correctly with the block's mgr_locs being converted to a list using the as_array() method. The sorting of blocks and the comparison using the equals method is also done properly.
