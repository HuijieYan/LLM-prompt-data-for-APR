1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are equal, then consolidates the DataFrames in place, and finally compares the blocks within the DataFrames for equality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks after sorting them using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, but it may not accurately represent the equality of the blocks.

3. The bug's cause is that the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks may not accurately represent the equality of the blocks. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the `equals` function wrongly returns True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual content of the blocks for sorting, rather than just their type name and manager locations.
   - Use a different approach for sorting and comparing the blocks to ensure accurate equality comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is removed, and the comparison of blocks is done directly using the `equals` method. This ensures that the actual content of the blocks is compared for equality, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
