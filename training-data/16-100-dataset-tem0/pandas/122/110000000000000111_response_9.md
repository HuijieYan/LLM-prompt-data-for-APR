1. The buggy function is a method called "equals" for a DataFrame object in the pandas library. The GitHub issue is related to this method wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the "equals" method. This comparison does not take into account the different locations of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause is that the "equals" method does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing DataFrames. This causes it to incorrectly return True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison of blocks to consider their locations.
   - Ensuring that the comparison of DataFrames takes into account the order and location of the blocks.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function now uses a tuple of the block's type name and its locations to ensure that blocks with different locations are not considered equal. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
