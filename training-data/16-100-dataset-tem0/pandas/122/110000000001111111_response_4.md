The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two BlockManager objects. The function is sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but it is not comparing the actual content of the blocks.

The expected output is False, indicating that the two BlockManager objects should not be considered equal. However, the buggy function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the function should compare the content of the blocks within the BlockManager objects, rather than just sorting them based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compare the content of the blocks within the BlockManager objects, leading to the expected output of False for the given input parameters.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the DataFrame.equals() method was incorrectly returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
