1. The buggy function is a method called "equals" which is used to compare two DataFrames in pandas. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames and expects the result to be False, but the actual result is True. The GitHub issue title and description indicate that the equals() method is returning True even when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the "equals" method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the different locations of the blocks.

3. The bug's cause is that the "equals" method is not properly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison of blocks to take into account their locations.
   - Ensuring that the comparison considers the order and location of the blocks in addition to their content.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code takes into account the locations of the blocks when comparing them, by using the "mgr_locs" attribute and converting it to a tuple for comparison. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
