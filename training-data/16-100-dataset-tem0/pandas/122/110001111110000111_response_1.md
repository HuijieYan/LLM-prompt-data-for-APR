The buggy function is the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to compare two DataFrames and check if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if the `equals` function returns False when comparing two DataFrames with different values.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` function is returning True instead of False when comparing the two DataFrames.

The GitHub issue title for this bug is "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations". The detailed description in the GitHub issue provides a code sample, the problem description, and the expected output.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the different locations of identical blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to consider the different locations of identical blocks when comparing DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now uses `tuple(block.mgr_locs)` to consider the different locations of identical blocks. This change ensures that the comparison takes into account the block locations.

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output. It also resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
