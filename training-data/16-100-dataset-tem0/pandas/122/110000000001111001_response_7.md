The bug in the function is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but it is not taking into account the order of the blocks. This causes the comparison of blocks to fail, even if the blocks are the same but in a different order.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the order of the blocks as well. We can achieve this by returning a tuple that includes the index of the block in addition to the dtype name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and index
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their dtype name, mgr_locs, and index, ensuring that the comparison is not affected by the order of the blocks. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output for the given test cases.
