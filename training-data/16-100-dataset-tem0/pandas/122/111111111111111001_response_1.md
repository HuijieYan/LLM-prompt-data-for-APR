The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is defined twice, once within the `BlockManager` class and once outside the class. This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and ensure that the correct version is used within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing the duplicate definition of the `canonicalize` function and using the correct version within the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
