The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This is causing the `equals` method to return True when it should be False, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the actual content of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test is checking if two DataFrames with different values are considered equal, which they should not be. The error message shows that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be False.

The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem, including the expected output and the versions of pandas and other relevant libraries being used.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the BlockManager objects is done correctly. This may involve comparing the actual content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should now correctly compare the content of the blocks within the BlockManager objects, ensuring that the `equals` method returns the expected results. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
