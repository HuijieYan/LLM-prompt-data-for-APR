1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It is called to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The function first checks if the number of axes in both instances is the same, and then it checks if the axes are equal. After that, it consolidates the data in both instances and compares the blocks in a canonicalized order to determine equality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the canonicalization of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, but it does not take into account the actual data within the blocks.

3. The bug's cause is that the `equals` function does not correctly compare the data within the blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. This causes it to incorrectly return `True` for instances with identical blocks but different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the canonicalization process to consider the actual data within the blocks, not just their data type and manager locations.
   - Update the comparison logic to compare the data within the blocks after canonicalization.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now considers the actual data within the blocks by using `block.values` for comparison. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the content of the blocks, not just their data type and manager locations.
