The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, and it is expecting the comparison to return `False`, indicating that the DataFrames are not equal. However, the comparison is returning `True` instead, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison logic is not working as expected, leading to the incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison of the blocks within the `equals` method. It seems that the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two instances of `BlockManager`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the blocks needs to be revised. One possible approach is to iterate through the blocks and compare them individually, rather than relying on sorting and comparing the entire lists of blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and return the expected result, passing the failing test.
