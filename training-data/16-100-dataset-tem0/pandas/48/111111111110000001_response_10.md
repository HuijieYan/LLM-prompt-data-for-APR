The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to cast values from `float64` to `int64` using the `astype` method. This is likely due to the fact that the function is trying to cast float values to integer values, which is not possible without potential loss of precision.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`. It is called by other methods within the class to perform aggregation operations on the grouped data.

The failing test is trying to apply aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` to grouped data containing nullable integer values. The error message indicates that the function is trying to cast float values to integer values, which is not possible.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer values appropriately and avoid casting to incompatible data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation based on the data type
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = block.values.astype(float)  # Convert integer values to float for aggregation
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle nullable integer values by converting them to float before performing aggregation. This approach ensures that the aggregation functions can be applied without encountering the `TypeError` related to casting from `float64` to `int64`. This should make the function pass the failing test.
