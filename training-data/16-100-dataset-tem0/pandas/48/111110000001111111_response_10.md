The issue seems to be related to the use of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the DataFrame, which is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean` function after grouping. The problem occurs when the `mean` function is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block where the result is being calculated and cast back to the original dtype.

The bug's cause is likely due to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `mean` function when called on a DataFrameGroupBy.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately when calculating the mean. This may involve checking for null values and handling them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately when calculating the mean, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
