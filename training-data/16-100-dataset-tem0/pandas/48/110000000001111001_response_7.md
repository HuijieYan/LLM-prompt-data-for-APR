The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the aggregation of data based on the `how` parameter. The function is intended to aggregate data based on the specified method, but it seems to be encountering issues when performing the aggregation.

The expected output for the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` variables is not being met, as the actual values do not match the expected values. This indicates that the aggregation process is not functioning as intended.

To fix this bug, the aggregation process needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that it correctly applies the specified aggregation method to the data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, alt=alt, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the aggregation process has been simplified to directly apply the aggregation method to each block of data. This should ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly and the expected output is generated.
