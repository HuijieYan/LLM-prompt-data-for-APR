The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the cases where the current line is a decorator or a flow control statement.

The failing test is showing a discrepancy in the number of empty lines in the expected and actual output. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the cases where the current line is a decorator or a flow control statement. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line needs to be reviewed and potentially revised.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function and ensure that it passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
