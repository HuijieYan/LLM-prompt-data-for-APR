The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines, leading to incorrect formatting of the code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This can be achieved by simplifying the conditional statements and ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specific conditions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_defs = []
    previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line has been refactored to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specific conditions. The conditional statements have been simplified to improve readability and maintainability.
