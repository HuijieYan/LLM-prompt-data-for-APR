The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted.

The function is making use of various attributes and methods from the `current_line` object and the `self` object, which is an instance of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It also interacts with the `previous_line` attribute of the `self` object.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is asserting the equality of the expected and actual output of the `fs` function, which calls the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output, specifically in terms of the number of empty lines.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual output suggest that the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted needs to be reviewed and corrected. This may involve adjusting the conditions and calculations within the function to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the input `current_line` and `self` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given input parameters.
