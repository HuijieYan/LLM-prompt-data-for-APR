The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column. This causes the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the for loop to correctly handle the different characters in the prefix and keep track of the current column position.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                if current_column >= column:
                    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(current_line):]
            if char != '\n':
                current_column += 1
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 3
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the cases provided and pass the failing test.
