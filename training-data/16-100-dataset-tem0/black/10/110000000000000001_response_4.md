1. The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line. However, there are issues with how it handles new lines and indentation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of new lines and indentation.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle new lines and indentation, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the logic for handling new lines and indentation to correctly consume the prefix based on the given column.
   - Ensure that the function properly tracks the current line and column while iterating through the prefix.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling new lines and indentation has been adjusted to ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed based on the given column. The function now properly tracks the current line and column while iterating through the prefix.
