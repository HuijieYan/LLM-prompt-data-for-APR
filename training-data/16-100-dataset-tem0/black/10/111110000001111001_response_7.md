The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before the specified column. This causes the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before the specified column. We can do this by checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column, and if so, returning the current line as the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return current_line, prefix[len(current_line):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
