The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a newline character. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for handling the newline character and indentation level. We can do this by keeping track of the current indentation level and comparing it with the specified column. If the current indentation level is less than the specified column, we should continue consuming characters until we reach the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = char
                    current_column = 1
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), ""
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and return the expected result for the failing test.
