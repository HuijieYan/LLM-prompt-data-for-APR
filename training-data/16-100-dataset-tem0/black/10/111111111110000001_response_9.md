The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `driver.py` file. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is located in the `test_black.py` file. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output.

The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be in the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and new lines needs to be revised. The function should correctly identify the indentation level and wait for a new line before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and new lines, and pass the failing test.
