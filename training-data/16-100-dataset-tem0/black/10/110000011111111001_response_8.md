The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix. It also does not correctly handle the case where the prefix is completely consumed.

The function should keep track of the current indentation level and compare it with the specified column. It should also handle the case where the prefix is completely consumed and return the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and the case where the prefix is completely consumed.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
