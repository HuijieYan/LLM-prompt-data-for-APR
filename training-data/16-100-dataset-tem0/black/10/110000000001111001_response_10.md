The issue with the function is that it is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. It is also not correctly updating the `lines` list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering a space, tab, or newline character. We also need to correctly update the `lines` list when encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
