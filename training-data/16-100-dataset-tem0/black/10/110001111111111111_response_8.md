The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, it has a bug that causes incorrect behavior when handling indentation and comments.

The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation and comments, which is causing the failing test to produce unexpected results. The failing test is checking the behavior of the function when dealing with comments and indentation, and it is failing due to the incorrect behavior of the function.

The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling the indentation and comments when consuming the prefix string. This is leading to incorrect behavior when the function encounters comments or changes in indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and comments in the prefix string. It should accurately track the current column and handle cases where comments or changes in indentation occur.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the indentation and comments in the prefix string, and it should pass the failing test. Additionally, it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
