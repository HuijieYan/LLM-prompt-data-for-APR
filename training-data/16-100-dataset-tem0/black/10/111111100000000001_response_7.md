The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. This function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value.

The potential error in the function lies in the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition. When `wait_for_nl` is True, the function checks if the current character is a newline character and then appends the current line to the `lines` list. However, the logic for updating the `current_column` and resetting `current_line` is incorrect, which may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_column` and resetting `current_line` when a newline character is encountered while `wait_for_nl` is True needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for updating `current_column` and resetting `current_line` when a newline character is encountered while `wait_for_nl` is True has been adjusted to ensure the correct behavior of the function.
