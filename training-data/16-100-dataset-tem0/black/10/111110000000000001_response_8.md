1. The buggy function is a method within the Driver class. It is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. However, there are issues with the logic and implementation of the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the wait_for_nl flag and the calculation of the current_column.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the wait_for_nl flag and the calculation of the current_column. This results in incorrect consumption of the prefix and incorrect splitting of the lines.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correctly handling the wait_for_nl flag to determine when to split the lines.
   - Adjusting the calculation of the current_column based on different characters.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the wait_for_nl flag and the calculation of the current_column have been adjusted to ensure the correct consumption of the prefix and splitting of the lines.
