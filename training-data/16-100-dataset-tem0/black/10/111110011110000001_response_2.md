The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the expected and actual output of the function, but it fails with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not matching for a specific input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new line characters, which is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of indentation and new line characters in the function. This is leading to incorrect splitting of the input prefix, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and new line characters in the input prefix. It should accurately split the prefix based on the specified column and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return '\n'.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected code should now accurately handle the indentation and new line characters in the input prefix, and it should pass the failing test.
