The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce an AssertionError. The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly tracking the column position and handling the indentation of comments. This is leading to incorrect output when the comments are indented after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. It should accurately track the column position and handle the indentation of comments to ensure that the output is correct.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent and pass the failing test. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
