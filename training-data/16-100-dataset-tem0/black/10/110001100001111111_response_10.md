The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the prefix and column values and updating the lines, current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables based on the characters in the prefix.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters and the logic for updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables. The function is not correctly identifying when to wait for a new line and when to update the current_column.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab characters and updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should handle the indentation correctly, especially when using tabs, and should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
