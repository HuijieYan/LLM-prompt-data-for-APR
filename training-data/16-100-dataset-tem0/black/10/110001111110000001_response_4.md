The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, the issue seems to be with the logic for handling indentation and new lines.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing because the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines in the input strings `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling indentation and new lines, specifically the `wait_for_nl` condition and the handling of spaces, tabs, and new lines.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying the indentation level and handling new lines, leading to incorrect output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Revising the logic for handling indentation and new lines.
2. Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the indentation level and consumes the prefix string accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and new lines, and pass the failing test.
