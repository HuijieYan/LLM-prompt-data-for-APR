The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large or very small. This causes an overflow error when trying to calculate the absolute value of these numbers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle these extreme cases. We can do this by checking if `vmin` or `vmax` are very large or very small, and if so, returning the endpoints as `-expander` and `expander` as specified in the function's docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the `nonsingular` function should now handle extreme cases of `vmin` and `vmax` without causing overflow errors. This should allow it to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
