The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function takes in `vmin` and `vmax` as the initial endpoints, and it has parameters such as `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing` to control the modification process. The function then checks for various conditions and modifies the endpoints accordingly.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the `fig.colorbar` function, which in turn calls the `nonsingular` function. The error message indicates that there are `RuntimeWarning` related to overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations within the `nonsingular` function.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is likely in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent comparison of `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The cause of the bug is that the calculations in the `nonsingular` function are leading to overflow warnings due to the use of large values and the comparison of very small differences.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calculations in the `nonsingular` function to avoid overflow and comparison issues. We can also consider using a different approach to handle the endpoint modifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should address the overflow and comparison issues, and it should pass the failing test.
