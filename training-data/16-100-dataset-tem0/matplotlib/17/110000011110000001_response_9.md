The problematic function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the colorbar functionality and is encountering runtime warnings related to overflow and scalar subtraction.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is likely in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent conditional statements that modify `vmin` and `vmax`.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling extreme values and intervals properly, leading to overflow and runtime warnings during the test.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `nonsingular` function need to be adjusted to handle extreme values and intervals more effectively. Additionally, the function should handle the case where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected code, the `nonsingular` function should handle extreme values and intervals properly, and it should pass the failing test without encountering overflow or runtime warnings.
