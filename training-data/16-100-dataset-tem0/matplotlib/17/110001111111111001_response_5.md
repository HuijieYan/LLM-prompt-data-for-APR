The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large or very small, leading to overflow errors. The function also does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped when `increasing` is set to `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `nonsingular` function to handle these cases. We can add checks for very large or very small values of `vmin` and `vmax`, and also handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` need to be swapped based on the `increasing` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected code, the `nonsingular` function should now handle the edge cases and pass the failing tests.
