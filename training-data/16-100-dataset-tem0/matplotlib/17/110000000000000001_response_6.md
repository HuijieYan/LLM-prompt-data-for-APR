1. The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in the initial endpoints (vmin and vmax), along with optional parameters expander, tiny, and increasing. The function checks for finite values, swaps vmin and vmax if necessary, and expands the interval if it is too small.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the maxabsvalue and the subsequent conditionals that modify vmin and vmax based on the interval size.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition for checking if the interval is smaller than the threshold (maxabsvalue * tiny) is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect modifications of vmin and vmax.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Re-evaluating the condition for checking the interval size and adjusting the modifications of vmin and vmax accordingly.
   - Ensuring that the calculations for maxabsvalue and the interval size are accurate and appropriate for the given problem.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif interval_size <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the interval size is calculated separately, and the condition for checking the interval size is adjusted to compare it directly with the threshold (maxabsvalue * tiny). The modifications of vmin and vmax are also adjusted based on the interval size. Additionally, the numpy library is imported to use the np.isfinite function.
