The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the condition for checking if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not handling the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are negative, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This will ensure that the condition works correctly for both positive and negative values.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
