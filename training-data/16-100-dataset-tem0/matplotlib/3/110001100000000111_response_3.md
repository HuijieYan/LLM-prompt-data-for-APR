The buggy function is a method called _recache within the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. This function is related to the markers.MarkerStyle class, which is used to customize the appearance of markers in matplotlib plots. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow by using markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle parameter, but not getting the desired result.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is attempting to call a marker function, but it is not properly defined or assigned, leading to the unexpected behavior when customizing the marker style.

The bug's cause is that the _marker_function is not properly defined or assigned within the _recache function, leading to unexpected behavior when customizing the marker style using markers.MarkerStyle.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define and assign a proper _marker_function within the _recache function to handle the customization of marker styles.
2. Ensure that the _marker_function is called with the correct parameters to properly customize the marker style.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    # Call the _marker_function with the correct parameters
    self._marker_function(self)
```

By making these changes, the _recache function will properly handle the customization of marker styles, and the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
