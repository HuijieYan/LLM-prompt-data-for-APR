The issue is that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected. This is due to the _filled variable being set to True regardless of the fillstyle value.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _filled variable based on the fillstyle value. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled variable will be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none', and the markers will appear hollow as expected.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where setting fillstyle to 'none' did not result in hollow markers when using ax.scatter(). The corrected code will now produce the expected behavior.
