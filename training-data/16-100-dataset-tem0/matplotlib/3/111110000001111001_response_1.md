The issue with the buggy function is that it is not setting the `_filled` variable to `True` as expected. This is likely due to the condition `if self._marker_function is None` not being met, so the function is not executed.

To fix this, we need to remove the condition and unconditionally execute `self._marker_function()`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will unconditionally set `_filled` to `True` as expected.
