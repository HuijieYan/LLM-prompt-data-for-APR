The issue is that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle`.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which overrides the intended behavior of setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the input `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the input `fillstyle`, and the markers should appear as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread, and the markers should now appear as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
