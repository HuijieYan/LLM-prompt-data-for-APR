1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker of 'o' and a fillstyle of 'none', and then check if the fillstyle is 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line is setting the marker to be filled by default, which contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'`.

3. The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting the marker to be filled by default, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This is evident from the code in the `_recache` function, the failing test, and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Updating the `MarkerStyle` class to handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
