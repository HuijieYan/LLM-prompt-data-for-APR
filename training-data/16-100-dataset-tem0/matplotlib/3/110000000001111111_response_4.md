The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not being properly handled when creating a custom MarkerStyle. The fillstyle parameter is not being considered in the _recache function, which is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally. This is likely causing the markers to always be filled, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

The bug's cause is that the _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally, which is not taking into account the fillstyle parameter set in the MarkerStyle.

To fix the bug, the _filled variable should be set based on the value of the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False, otherwise it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled variable accordingly. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and ensure that markers appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
