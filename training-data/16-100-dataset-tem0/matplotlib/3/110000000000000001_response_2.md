1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to reset certain attributes and then call a marker function. However, there is a potential error in the function as it is not handling the case where the marker function is not defined.

2. The potential error location is the line where the marker function is called without checking if it is defined or not.

3. The bug's cause is that if the marker function is not defined, the function will raise an AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the marker function is defined before calling it. If it is not defined, we can simply return from the function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```
