The potential error location within the problematic function is the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` line in the failing test. This is because the `is_filled` method is not properly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, which is causing the test to fail.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method is not defined in the `MarkerStyle` class, which is why the failing test is unable to verify the fill status of the marker.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly determine if the marker is filled or not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With the `is_filled` method implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, the failing test should now pass.
