The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the failing test, as it expects `is_filled` to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the `is_filled` method will return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
