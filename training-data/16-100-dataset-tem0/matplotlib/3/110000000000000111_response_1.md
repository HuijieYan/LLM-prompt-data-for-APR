1. The buggy function is not directly related to the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers as hollow, while the buggy function is a method that seems to be related to marker handling in a different context.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` as it seems to be calling a marker function that may not be properly defined or implemented.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_marker_function` is being called without proper implementation or definition, which may be related to the issue of markers not being hollow as expected in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the `_marker_function` and ensure it is properly defined and handles marker properties correctly.
   - Verify that the marker properties are being set correctly in the function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    # assuming _marker_function is a valid function that handles marker properties
    # calling _marker_function with self as an argument
    self._marker_function(self)
```

This corrected code assumes that `_marker_function` is a valid function that handles marker properties and is called with `self` as an argument to properly handle marker properties. This should help in resolving the issue of markers not being hollow as expected in the GitHub issue.
