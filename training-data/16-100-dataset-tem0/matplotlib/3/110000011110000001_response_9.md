The buggy function is a method called `_recache` which is part of a class that seems to be related to markers in a plotting library. The function sets a number of attributes to default values and then calls a `_marker_function` method.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a specific fillstyle and then checks if the `is_filled` method returns the correct value.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value, and it also shows that the method being called is `<bound method MarkerStyle.is_filled of <matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle object at 0x10ec7b880>>`.

This suggests that the `is_filled` method is not being called correctly, possibly due to the `_marker_function` not being set properly in the `_recache` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is set to the correct method that updates the `is_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function = self._update_marker
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, we set the `_marker_function` attribute to the `_update_marker` method (or whatever method is responsible for updating the `is_filled` attribute) before calling it. This should ensure that the `is_filled` attribute is updated correctly, and the failing test should pass.
