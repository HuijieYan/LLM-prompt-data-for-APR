1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class, which is used to customize marker styles in matplotlib. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow using the fillstyle parameter, but the desired result is not achieved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _marker_function is called. It seems that this function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter, which is causing the markers to not be hollow as expected.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the _marker_function not properly handling the fillstyle parameter. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user is setting fillstyle='none' but not getting the desired hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the implementation of the _marker_function to ensure it properly handles the fillstyle parameter.
   - Modifying the _marker_function to correctly interpret the fillstyle parameter and adjust the marker style accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute to False, the markers will be rendered as hollow when using the MarkerStyle class with the fillstyle parameter set to 'none'. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
