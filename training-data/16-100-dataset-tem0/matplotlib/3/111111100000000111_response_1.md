1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is responsible for recaching the marker style attributes. The GitHub issue indicates that when using the scatter function with a custom MarkerStyle and setting the fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _marker_function is called. It seems that this function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the _marker_function not properly handling the fillstyle parameter. The MarkerStyle class is responsible for defining the appearance of markers, and the _recache function is used to update the marker attributes. The GitHub issue provides a code example that demonstrates the problem when using a custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle set to 'none'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the _marker_function to ensure it properly handles the fillstyle parameter.
   - Checking for any other related functions or attributes that may be affecting the fillstyle behavior.
   - Testing the code example provided in the GitHub issue to replicate the problem and verify the fix.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute to False, the markers will be hollow when using the scatter function with a custom MarkerStyle and setting the fillstyle to 'none'. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
