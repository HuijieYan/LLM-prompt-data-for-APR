1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The function is responsible for resetting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. The failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should not be.

The GitHub issue describes a situation where the user is trying to create hollow markers using `ax.scatter()` and setting the `fillstyle` to 'none', but it is not working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

3. The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the marker is intended to be hollow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Update the logic in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the `_filled` attribute.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `_recache` function now considers the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and also pass the failing test.
