1. The buggy function is a part of the markers.py file in the matplotlib library. It seems to be a method for recaching marker properties. The function sets various properties to default values and then calls a marker function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the line where it calls self._marker_function().

3. The bug's cause could be that the _marker_function is not defined or is not being set properly, which would result in an error when the function is called.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to check if _marker_function is properly defined and set before calling it. Additionally, ensuring that the function is being called in the correct context and with the correct parameters.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()  # Call _marker_function only if it is not None
```
