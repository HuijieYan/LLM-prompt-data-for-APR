1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is responsible for recalculating the marker style attributes. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is attempting to call a function that does not exist, which will result in an AttributeError.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_marker_function` attribute is being called without being defined anywhere in the class or related functions. This is likely a mistake and is causing the function to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to either define the `_marker_function` attribute within the class or remove the line that calls it if it is not necessary for the recaching process.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            # Remove the line below if _marker_function is not necessary
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before attempting to call it. If it is not necessary for the recaching process, the line calling `_marker_function` can be removed.
