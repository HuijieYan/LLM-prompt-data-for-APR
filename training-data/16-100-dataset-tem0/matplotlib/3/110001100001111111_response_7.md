The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not being properly handled in the _recache function of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The expected behavior is that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers should be hollow, but the actual behavior is that they are not.

The potential error location within the _recache function is the line where self._filled is set to True unconditionally. This means that even if fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will still be filled.

The bug's cause is that the _recache function does not properly handle the fillstyle parameter, leading to the markers being filled even when fillstyle is set to 'none'. This discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior is the root cause of the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the _recache function needs to be modified to properly handle the fillstyle parameter. If fillstyle is set to 'none', then self._filled should be set to False to ensure that the markers are hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will properly handle the fillstyle parameter, ensuring that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will be hollow as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where setting fillstyle to 'none' did not result in hollow markers as expected.
