The issue is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, but it should be set to `True` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `False` only when the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.

This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where setting `fillstyle='none'` did not result in hollow markers as expected.
