The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker of 'o' and fillstyle of 'none', and then check if the fillstyle is 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The potential error location within the `_recache` method is the line `self._filled = True`. This line is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled` method to always return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.
