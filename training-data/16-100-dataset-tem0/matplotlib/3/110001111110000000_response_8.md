```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check for not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:  # Removed the parentheses to call the function
            self._marker_function()
```
The issue in the original code was that the condition `if self._marker_function is None` was causing the function to return without executing the rest of the code. The corrected code checks for `if self._marker_function is not None` to ensure that the rest of the code is executed when the marker function is not None. Additionally, the call to `_marker_function` was updated to `if self._marker_function` to properly call the function.
