```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check for not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Changed to False to make the marker hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

The issue was with the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` which should be `if self._marker_function is not None:`. Additionally, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to make the marker hollow.

The failing test should now pass with the corrected function.
