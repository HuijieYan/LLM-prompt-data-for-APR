1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is responsible for recaching the marker style attributes. It checks if the marker function is None and if not, it resets the marker attributes and calls the marker function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it calls the marker function without checking if it exists or not.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not checking if the marker function exists before calling it, which can lead to a potential AttributeError if the marker function is not defined.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to see if the marker function exists before calling it.
   - Handle the case where the marker function is not defined.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if the marker function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the marker function exists before calling it. This will prevent any potential AttributeError that may occur if the marker function is not defined.
