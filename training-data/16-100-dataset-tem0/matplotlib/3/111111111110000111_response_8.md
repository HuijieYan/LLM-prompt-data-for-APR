1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is supposed to recache the marker style, but it is not correctly setting the filled attribute, leading to a failing test and an issue on GitHub.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the filled attribute is set to True. This is likely causing the marker to be filled when it should be hollow.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is not correctly setting the filled attribute to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evident from the failing test, which checks if the marker is filled or not, and the GitHub issue where the user is trying to create hollow markers but is not getting the desired result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the _recache function to correctly set the filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.
   - Update the MarkerStyle class to handle the fillstyle parameter and set the filled attribute accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the _recache function now correctly sets the filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. This should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub, allowing users to create hollow markers when setting the fillstyle to 'none'.
