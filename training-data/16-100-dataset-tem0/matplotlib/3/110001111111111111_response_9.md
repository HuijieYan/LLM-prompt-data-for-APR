The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this, we need to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
