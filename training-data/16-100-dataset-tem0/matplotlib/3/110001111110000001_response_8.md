The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is calling a function that is not defined within the `_recache` function, which is causing the failing test.

The bug's cause is that the `_marker_function` is not defined within the `_recache` function, so when it is called, it results in an error.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `_marker_function` within the `_recache` function or remove the call to `_marker_function` if it is not necessary for the function to work properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
