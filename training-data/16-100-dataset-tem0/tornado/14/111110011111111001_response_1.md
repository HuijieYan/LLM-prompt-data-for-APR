The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, make the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling this logic properly, leading to the RuntimeError in the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before making it the current instance.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
