The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. The `make_current` parameter is not being used properly to determine whether a new IOLoop instance should be created.

The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and then it expects an error to be raised when trying to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` again.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter and raise an error if necessary.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
