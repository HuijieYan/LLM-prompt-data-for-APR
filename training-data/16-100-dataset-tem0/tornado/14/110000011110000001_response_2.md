1. The buggy function is a part of the Tornado framework, specifically the IOLoop class. The function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and making it the current IOLoop if required. The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with make_current=True and then attempting to create another IOLoop instance with make_current=True, which should raise a RuntimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif block where it checks if make_current is True and then checks if the current IOLoop already exists. 

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists. This is evident from the error message which states "RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic to correctly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists.
   - Add a check to see if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists, and it will pass the failing test.
