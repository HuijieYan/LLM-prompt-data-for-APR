The buggy function `initialize` is a method of a class, and it seems to be related to setting up an IOLoop. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, and then it checks if the current IOLoop is the one that was just created. However, the test is failing with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the `if make_current is None` block. It checks if `make_current` is None and if the current IOLoop is None, then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is True, it should also check if the current IOLoop is None before calling `self.make_current()`.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. This is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. We can do this by adding an additional check before calling `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, and only then raise a `RuntimeError`. This change should make the failing test `test_force_current` pass, and it also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
