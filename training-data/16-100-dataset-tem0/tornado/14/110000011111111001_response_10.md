The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, make the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
