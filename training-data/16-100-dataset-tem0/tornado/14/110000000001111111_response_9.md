The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then make it the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation is not handling the True case properly.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" is pointing out that the function is checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is not None, then it raises "already exists" error, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to properly handle the case when make_current is True. We can do this by checking if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then make it the current IOLoop. If an instance already exists and make_current is True, then we should not raise an error, but simply make it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # If an instance already exists and make_current is True, then make it the current IOLoop
            self.current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the case when make_current is True and will not raise an error if an instance already exists. This resolves the issue posted in GitHub and also satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
