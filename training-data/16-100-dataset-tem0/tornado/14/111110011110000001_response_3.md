1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. It is called with the argument `make_current=True` in the failing test. The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` method is the conditional statement `if make_current is None:`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly. It is not checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.

4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` by checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raising an error if it does.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error if it does. This should make the failing test pass.
