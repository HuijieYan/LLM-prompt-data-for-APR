The issue in the buggy function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. The function is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not properly handling the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists. This causes the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to properly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case when make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists, and it will no longer raise a RuntimeError in that scenario. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
