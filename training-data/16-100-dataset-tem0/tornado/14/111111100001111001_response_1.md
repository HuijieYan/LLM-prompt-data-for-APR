The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and optionally make it the current IOLoop. However, the current logic is incorrect and does not handle the `make_current` parameter properly.

The potential error location is in the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and try to make the IOLoop current.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking the value of `make_current` and not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` or `False` properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        pass  # Do nothing if make_current is False
    else:
        raise ValueError("make_current must be True, False, or None")
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises an error if it does. If `make_current` is `False`, it does nothing. If `make_current` is `None`, it follows the original logic to make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist.
