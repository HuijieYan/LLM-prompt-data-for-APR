The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. The function is supposed to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and then make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one. However, the current implementation is not doing this correctly, leading to the RuntimeError in the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that it becomes the current `IOLoop` instance if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and then make the new instance the current one if necessary.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
