The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError, otherwise it calls `self.make_current()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current`.

The bug's cause is that the conditional statements are not handling the logic correctly. The GitHub issue is pointing out that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it should not raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to handle the logic correctly and remove the unnecessary checks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the logic and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
