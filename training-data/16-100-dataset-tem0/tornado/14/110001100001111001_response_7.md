The bug in the initialize function is that it is trying to call the current function from the IOLoop class without referencing the class itself. Additionally, the make_current function is being called without referencing the self parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to reference the current function and the make_current function from the IOLoop class using the self parameter. We also need to remove the unnecessary if condition for make_current being None.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will now correctly reference the current and make_current functions from the IOLoop class using the self parameter, and the unnecessary if condition for make_current being None has been removed. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
