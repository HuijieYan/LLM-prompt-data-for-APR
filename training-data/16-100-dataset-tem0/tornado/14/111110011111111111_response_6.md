The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory because if `make_current` is True, it should always try to become the current instance, regardless of whether there is already a current instance or not.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to always make the current instance if `make_current` is True, without checking if there is already a current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        pass
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Invalid value for make_current")
```

With this correction, the function will always try to become the current instance if `make_current` is True, and it will only make the current instance if there is no current instance and `make_current` is None. If `make_current` is None and there is already a current instance, it will do nothing.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
