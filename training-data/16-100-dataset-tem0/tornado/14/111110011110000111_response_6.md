1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and making it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to True. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then check if it becomes the current IOLoop. However, the test is failing with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method where it checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop and raising a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is True. This behavior is not consistent with the expected functionality.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic in the `initialize` method to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.
   - Update the `make_current` method to handle the logic of making the IOLoop current.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. This change should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
