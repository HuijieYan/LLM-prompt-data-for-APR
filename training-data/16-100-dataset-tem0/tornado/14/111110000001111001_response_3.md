The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if there is, instead of trying to make the current `IOLoop` without checking.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected.
