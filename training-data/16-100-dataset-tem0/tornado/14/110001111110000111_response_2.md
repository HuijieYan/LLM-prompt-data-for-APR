The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is contradictory to the intended logic.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True. The intention seems to be to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does, but the current implementation is not achieving this.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True. It should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and ensure that a RuntimeError is only raised if an IOLoop instance already exists.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
