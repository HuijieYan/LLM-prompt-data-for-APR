1. The buggy function is an initialization function that takes a parameter make_current. If make_current is None, it checks if an IOLoop instance exists and if not, it calls the make_current method. If make_current is True, it checks if an IOLoop instance exists and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. 

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional statements and the use of self.make_current().

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case where make_current is False.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to handle the case where make_current is False.
   - Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # handle the case where make_current is False
        pass
```
In the corrected code, I added an else statement to handle the case where make_current is False. This ensures that all possible values of make_current are handled properly.
