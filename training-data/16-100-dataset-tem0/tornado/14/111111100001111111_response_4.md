The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this logic is incorrect because if `make_current` is True, it should not raise an error if the current IOLoop instance is None.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and does not raise an error when it shouldn't.
