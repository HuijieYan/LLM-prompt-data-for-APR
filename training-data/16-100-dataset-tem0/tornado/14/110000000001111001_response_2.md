The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional statements. The function is supposed to check if the IOLoop is already current, and if not, make it current. However, the logic is flawed and does not handle the cases properly.

The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the case when make_current is True. It should check if the IOLoop is already current and raise an error if it is, or make it current if it is not.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case when make_current is True and ensure that the IOLoop is only made current if it is not already.
