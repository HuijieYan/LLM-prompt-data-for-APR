1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and making it the current IOLoop if necessary.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is None. If it is, then it checks if there is already a current IOLoop using the `IOLoop.current` function. If not, it calls the `make_current` function to make the IOLoop current. The potential error lies in the logic of these conditional statements.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for checking if `make_current` is None does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is False. This can lead to the IOLoop not being made current when it should be.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a separate conditional statement to handle the case where `make_current` is False.
   - Refactoring the logic to make it clearer and more robust.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:  # Handle the case where make_current is False
            pass  # Do nothing, as the IOLoop should not be made current
```

In the corrected code, a separate conditional statement has been added to handle the case where `make_current` is False. This ensures that the IOLoop is not made current when `make_current` is False.
