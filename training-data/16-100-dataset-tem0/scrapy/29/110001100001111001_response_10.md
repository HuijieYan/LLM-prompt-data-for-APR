The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is using the `to_bytes` function to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes, but the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` in some cases, which causes an error when concatenating with `b"\r\n"`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before converting it to bytes and concatenating it with `b"\r\n"`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will now handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and will not cause any errors.
