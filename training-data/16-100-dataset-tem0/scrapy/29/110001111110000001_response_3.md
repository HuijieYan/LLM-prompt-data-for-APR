The potential error location within the problematic function is the `parsed.hostname` attribute, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not being properly handled when it is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `parsed.hostname` attribute is checked for existence before adding the `Host` header to the raw HTTP representation. This will prevent the `to_bytes` function from receiving a `NoneType` object and resolve the `TypeError` issue.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test.
