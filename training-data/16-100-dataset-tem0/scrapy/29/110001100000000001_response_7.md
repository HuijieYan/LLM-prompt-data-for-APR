1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request, and the `urlunparse` function to construct the path. It then constructs the HTTP request line, adds the host and headers, and finally appends the request body.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the construction of the HTTP request line, the addition of the host and headers, or the appending of the request body.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect construction of the HTTP request line, host, headers, or request body. This could be due to incorrect usage of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, or mishandling of the request object's attributes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are used correctly to construct the path.
   - Checking the request object's attributes to correctly construct the HTTP request line, host, headers, and request body.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += key.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- The `urlparse_cached` function is replaced with `urlparse` for parsing the request URL.
- The `urlunparse` function is used to construct the path.
- The HTTP request line, host, and headers are constructed using the parsed URL and request object's attributes.
- The strings are encoded to bytes before concatenation.
