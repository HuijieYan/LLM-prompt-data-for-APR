The issue in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being set when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https'. This causes the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https' and set the `parsed.hostname` to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the `parsed.hostname` is only used when the URL scheme is 'http' or 'https', and the failing test should pass.
