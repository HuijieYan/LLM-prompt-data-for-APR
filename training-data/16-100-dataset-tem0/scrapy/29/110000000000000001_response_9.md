1. The buggy function takes a request object and attempts to return the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes.

2. The potential error location within the function is the concatenation of the request headers and body to the byte string 's'.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is trying to concatenate the request headers and body directly to the byte string 's' without properly encoding them to bytes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Encoding the request headers and body to bytes before concatenating them to the byte string 's'.
   - Checking for the existence of request headers and body before attempting to concatenate them.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
import requests

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the request headers are properly encoded to bytes using the 'to_bytes' function before concatenating them to the byte string 's'. Additionally, a check for the existence of request headers and body is added before attempting to concatenate them.
