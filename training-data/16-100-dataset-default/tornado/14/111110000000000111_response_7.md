The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the current instance of the `IOLoop`. However, there are issues with how it handles the `make_current` parameter and the calls to the `current` and `make_current` methods. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a contradiction in the behavior of the function when checking if the current `IOLoop` exists.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional checks for `make_current`. When `make_current` is not provided and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, the function should make the current instance. However, when `make_current` is provided and it is `True`, the function should only make the current instance if it does not already exist. The error seems to stem from the inconsistent handling of these conditions.

The buggy function does not handle the `make_current` parameter properly, leading to contradictory behavior when checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This results in a potential RuntimeError being incorrectly raised when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be revised. When `make_current` is not provided, the function should check if the current instance is `None` and then make it current. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should only make the instance current if it does not already exist.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
With this corrected code, the function now handles the `make_current` parameter appropriately and does not raise a RuntimeError when it shouldn't.
