The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, the function should be checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising an error, but it is instead directly checking if it is None. This is causing the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError when it shouldn't.

The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of IOLoop, then it should raise a RuntimeError. If `make_current` is False or None, it should make the current instance if one does not exist.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be updated to correctly check if the current instance is not None before deciding whether to raise an error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated code will fix the issue and make the function behave as expected. It will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it will successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
