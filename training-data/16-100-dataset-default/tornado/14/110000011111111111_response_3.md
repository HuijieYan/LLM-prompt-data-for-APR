The issue in the code is that the `initialize` function is checking for the presence of an IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True, and throwing an error if an instance already exists, even when it doesn't. This is causing the test to fail and the RuntimeError to be raised.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if there is an existing IOLoop instance and only throw the error if there is one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `make_current` is None and then check if there is no current IOLoop instance before calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True, it will check if there is a current IOLoop instance and throw an error if one exists.

This corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, as well as address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
