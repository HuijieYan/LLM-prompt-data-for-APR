The issue with the initialize function is that it is not checking the value of make_current correctly. It should be checking if it is not None and then making it the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
