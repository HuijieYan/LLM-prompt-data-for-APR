The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is trying to call `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` without referencing the correct modules. The correct reference to these functions should be `current` and `make_current`.

The potential error location is at the calls to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the code is referencing the functions from the wrong module, which leads to the function calls failing and the tests not passing.

To fix the bug, we need to change the references to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` to just `current` and `make_current` since they are in the same module.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected for the given input parameters.
