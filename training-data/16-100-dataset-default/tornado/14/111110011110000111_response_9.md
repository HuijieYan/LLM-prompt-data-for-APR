1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class. The function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and making it the current IOLoop if specified. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current IOLoop is the one that was just created. However, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when it is not expected, as indicated by the failing test and the error message.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `make_current` in the `initialize` function. There seems to be an issue with the logic of checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

3. The cause of the bug can be identified as follows:
   (a). The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop if `make_current` is specified.
   (b). The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create the current IOLoop with `make_current=True`.
   (c). The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it's not expected, suggesting an issue with the logic of checking the current IOLoop's existence.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the conditional check for the current IOLoop's existence might be incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that it correctly handles the case when `make_current` is specified.
   (b). Check if the logic for determining the current IOLoop's existence is accurate and update it if necessary.
   (c). Ensure that the `make_current` argument is properly reflected in the initialization process.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the initialization process will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the current IOLoop is set as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
