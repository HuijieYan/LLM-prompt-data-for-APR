The buggy function is the `initialize` method of a class, which takes a `make_current` parameter. The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` again, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the `elif make_current` block, where it should be checking if an IOLoop already exists instead of checking if it doesn't exist.

The bug's cause is that the `initialize` method is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True`. Instead of checking if the IOLoop instance exists, it checks if it doesn't exist and then tries to make it current, leading to a situation where the second attempt to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` fails.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition in the `elif make_current` block to check if an IOLoop instance already exists instead of not existing.
2. Remove the check for the existence of an IOLoop in the `elif make_current` block as it might not be necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check if an IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` for the second `make_current=True` construction.
