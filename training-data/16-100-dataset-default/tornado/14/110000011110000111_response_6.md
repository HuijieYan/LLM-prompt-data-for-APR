The buggy function is the `initialize` function which is a method of a class, but it's not clear from the given code what class it belongs to. However, from the error message and the failing test, it seems to be related to an IOLoop class.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the condition in the `elif` block where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If both conditions are true, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This seems to be the cause of the failing test and the error message from the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, it is checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if it is, it raises an error saying that it already exists.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` instead of checking if it is `None`.
2. Remove the check for `None` and directly call `self.make_current()` within the `elif` block.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
