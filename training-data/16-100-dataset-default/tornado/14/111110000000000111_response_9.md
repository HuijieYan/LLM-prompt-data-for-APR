After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class and the GitHub issue, it appears that the potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `make_current`. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditional check for `make_current` does not account for the case where `make_current` is `False` and the current IOLoop instance exists. This results in a RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check for `make_current` to include a check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `False`. This will ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when it is appropriate.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the issue posted in GitHub should be resolved, and the conditional checks for `make_current` are more accurately handled. This should prevent the erroneous RuntimeError from being raised.
