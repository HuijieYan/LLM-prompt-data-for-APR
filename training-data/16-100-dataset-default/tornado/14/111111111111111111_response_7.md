The issue in the buggy function is that the condition to raise a RuntimeError is incorrect. It is currently checking if `make_current` is True and if there is already a current instance of IOLoop, then it should raise the error. However, in the failing test case, the `make_current` parameter is explicitly set to True.

The cause of the bug:
(a). The buggy function `initialize` is incorrectly handling the `make_current` parameter.
(b). The buggy class `IOLoop` is not properly checking for the current instance before making a new one.
(c). The related functions `current` and `make_current` are not being used correctly in the `initialize` function.
(d). The failing test is explicitly passing `make_current=True` and expects a RuntimeError if a current instance already exists.
(e). The expected input/output variable information provided shows that when `make_current` is explicitly set to True, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is expected to raise a RuntimeError, as seen in the failing test and error message.
(f). The GitHub issue also mentions the incorrect behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and the subsequent raise of "already exists".

To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function for checking `make_current` should be changed. It should check if `make_current` is True and if a current instance already exists, then it should raise the error.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... other functions ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check if `make_current` is True and if a current instance already exists, then raise the RuntimeError. This will pass the failing test, satisfy the input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
