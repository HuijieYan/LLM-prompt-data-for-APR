The potential error location in the buggy function is in the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop. It is currently not handling the case where make_current is True and an IOLoop already exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where make_current is True and an IOLoop already exists. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised when it should not be.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the conditional checks in the initialize function to properly handle the case when make_current is True and an IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop based on the value of make_current and handles the case where make_current is True and an IOLoop already exists. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
