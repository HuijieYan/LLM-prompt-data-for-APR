1. The initialize function takes a make_current parameter and checks if an IOLoop.current instance exists. If make_current is None, it calls self.make_current(). If make_current is True, it checks if an IOLoop.current instance exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does. 

2. The potential error is in the condition for make_current being True, where it should be calling self.make_current() and not raising an error if the IOLoop.current instance already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to handle the make_current parameter in two different ways, but the logic is not implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the condition for make_current=True and call self.make_current() only if IOLoop.current instance does not exist.
   - Remove the unnecessary check for make_current=None as it is already handled in the else block.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
