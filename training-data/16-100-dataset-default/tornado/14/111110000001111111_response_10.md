The problem with the `initialize` function is that it is not checking the condition for `make_current` properly. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, in the current implementation, it is raising the error regardless of the value of `make_current`.

The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this problem. The function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if so, it tries to make the current instance. However, if `make_current` is True, it should also check if there is already a current instance before trying to make it current.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `make_current` parameter and only raise an error if necessary.

GitHub issue title: `ioloop.py(line 252) wrong condition for raising error`

GitHub issue description:
```
In the `initialize` function at line 252 of ioloop.py, the condition for raising the error "already exists" is not properly checking if there is already a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True.
