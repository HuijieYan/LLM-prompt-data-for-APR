The problem in the buggy function is that the `make_current` attribute is not being properly handled. It should be checked if it's `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, an error should be raised.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then re-create it with `make_current=True` again, which should fail and raise a `RuntimeError`.

The current function does not handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, which causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialize function to properly handle the `make_current` attribute and raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will check if `make_current` is True and if a current IOLoop instance already exists, and then raise a `RuntimeError` accordingly. This will make the failing test pass, and the expected input/output variable information will be satisfied.
