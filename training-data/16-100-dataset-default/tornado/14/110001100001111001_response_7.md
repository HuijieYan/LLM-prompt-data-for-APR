The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional statements. It seems that the make_current parameter is not being used correctly. The intention seems to be that if make_current is None, then self.make_current() should be called, and if make_current is True, then it should check if current IOLoop exists and then call self.make_current(). 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the make_current parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, it should now correctly handle the make_current parameter and execute the conditional statements as intended. This should resolve the issue with the failing tests.
