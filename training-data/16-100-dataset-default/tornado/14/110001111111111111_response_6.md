The issue in the buggy code is that the `make_current` function is not called properly when `make_current` is None. Additionally, the condition for raising a RuntimeError is incorrect.

The bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function 'initialize' should call the `make_current` function if `make_current` is None, but it is not doing so.
(b). The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but it fails due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function, leading to a RuntimeError being raised erroneously.
(c). The expected input of the failing test is `make_current=True`, but the actual output is a RuntimeError due to the mishandling of the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug:
We need to call the `make_current` function when `make_current` is None and update the condition for raising a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the code will correctly call the `make_current` function when `make_current` is None, and the condition for raising a RuntimeError is also fixed.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
