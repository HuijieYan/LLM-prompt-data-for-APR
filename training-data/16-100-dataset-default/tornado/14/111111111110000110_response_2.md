```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    # More code here

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the `initialize` function, the condition `if make_current is None:` was changed to `if make_current is None or make_current is True:` in order to fix the issue mentioned in the failing test. Additionally, the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` was changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`. These changes help to ensure that the correct logic is applied, addressing the bug in the original code.
