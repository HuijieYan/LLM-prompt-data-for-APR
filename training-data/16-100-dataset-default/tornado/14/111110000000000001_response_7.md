1. The buggy function "initialize" is a method of the class IOLoop. It is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and setting it as the current IOLoop if necessary.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statements that check the value of "make_current" and whether an IOLoop instance already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. It should be checking if an IOLoop instance does not exist, but it is currently checking if it does exist. Additionally, the logic for handling the "make_current" parameter is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the conditional statement to check if an IOLoop instance does not exist.
   - Update the logic for handling the "make_current" parameter to correctly set the IOLoop as current or not based on the parameter value.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
