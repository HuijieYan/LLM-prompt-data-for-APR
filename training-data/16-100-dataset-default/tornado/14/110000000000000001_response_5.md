Analysis:
The initialize function is meant to initialize an IOLoop object and make it the current IOLoop if the make_current parameter is True or None. However, the function has a few logical errors that prevent it from working correctly.

Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the logic for checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. It is not correctly checking for the current IOLoop instance.

Bug's cause:
The if-else conditions are not properly handling the make_current parameter and checking for the current IOLoop instance.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the make_current parameter is True or None and handle the logic accordingly.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the RuntimeError when the current IOLoop already exists.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        try:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        except RuntimeError:
            current_instance = None

        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
