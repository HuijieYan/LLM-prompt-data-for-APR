The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and then either creates a new instance or raises an error if one already exists. The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, as it still raises a RuntimeError, even though it should only do so when `make_current` is True and an instance of IOLoop already exists.

The GitHub issue title could be "IOLoop.current(instance=False) returns unexpected value causing RuntimeError".

The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The `make_current` parameter is not being utilized properly to define when to raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. The `make_current` parameter should be used to determine when to create a new IOLoop instance and when to raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected code checks if `make_current` is True, and if so, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before raising a RuntimeError. This satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
