```python
# The source code of the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
The issue in the original code is that the condition on line 252 is incorrect. It should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, rather than checking if it is None. The corrected version of the function includes this fix.
