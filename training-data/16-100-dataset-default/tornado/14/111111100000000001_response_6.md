The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class. This function is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` and making it the current instance if specified.

The potential error lies in the conditional statements for `make_current`. The first conditional statement checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, then it calls the `make_current` function. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` before calling the `make_current` function.

The bug here is that the `make_current` function may not be called in case `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance does exist.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the conditional statements and ensure that the `make_current` function is called when necessary.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    # this is the corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected function, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in the `current_instance` variable. Then, in the conditional statements, we check if `make_current` is `None` and if the `current_instance` does not exist, then we call the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`, we check if the `current_instance` exists, and if so, raise an error. Finally, we always call the `make_current` function when necessary.
