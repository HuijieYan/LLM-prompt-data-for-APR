The problem seems to be with the logic in the `initialize` function. It is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. It is trying to call `self.make_current()` without checking if it exists. Additionally, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and also properly check if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
- We use `elif make_current is True` to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True`.
- For the case when `make_current` is `True`, we first check if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. If it doesn't exist, we call `self.make_current()` to make the current IOLoop instance.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
