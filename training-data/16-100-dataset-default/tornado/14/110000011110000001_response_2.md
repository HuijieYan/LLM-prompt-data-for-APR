1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance and make it the current instance if required. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the IOLoop instance is the current one, and if trying to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method when checking if the IOLoop is already current.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is not handling the execution flow correctly. It checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it should make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should also make the IOLoop current if it doesn't already exist, but if it does exist, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation does not handle these cases properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic within the `initialize` method to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
   - Add conditional checks to ensure that the IOLoop is made current or a `RuntimeError` is raised based on the value of `make_current`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method properly checks the value of `make_current` and the current state of the IOLoop instance, making it the current one if required and raising a `RuntimeError` if it's already the current one. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
