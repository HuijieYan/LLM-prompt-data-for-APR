The issue here is that the `initialize` method is not properly setting the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. 

To fix this, we can modify the `initialize` method as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This change ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if one exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If not, it sets the current `IOLoop` instance.
