1. The buggy function `initialize` is trying to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and then make it the current instance if it doesn't. It calls the functions `current` and `make_current` from the same file, but not the same class.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `if make_current is None` condition and in the `elif make_current` condition.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not using the correct syntax for calling the related functions. It should call `current` and `make_current` as methods of the `IOLoop` class, rather than as standalone functions. Additionally, there is a missing self parameter in the `make_current` call.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly call the related functions from the `IOLoop` class and also pass the necessary self parameter to the `make_current` method.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# This is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
