The problem is occurring because in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, when `make_current` is True, it is trying to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the logic for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if a current IOLoop instance exists
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if a current IOLoop instance already exists for the current IOLoop object
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now be able to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current` is True.

This should resolve the failing test case and produce the expected output for the given input parameters.
