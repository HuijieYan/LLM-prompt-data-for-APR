Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the logic in the initialize function, specifically in the if condition where it checks if make_current is None. It then calls the current function from the IOLoop class with instance=False and if it is None, it calls the make_current function. However, the logic for handling the case when make_current is not None seems to be incorrect, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised.

Bug's cause:
The issue seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the make_current parameter in the initialize function of the IOLoop class. When make_current is True, the code incorrectly checks if the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and then raises a RuntimeError if it is indeed None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the initialize function to correctly handle the make_current parameter, ensuring that it only raises a RuntimeError if make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Update the test function to account for the corrected behavior of the initialize function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the if condition in the elif block to check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, the code will now correctly handle the make_current parameter and correctly handle the RuntimeError. This will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
