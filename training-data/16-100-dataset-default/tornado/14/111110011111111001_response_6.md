The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and handle the make_current parameter. However, the current implementation is not handling the make_current parameter correctly, leading to the RuntimeError in the failing test.

The potential error location is the conditional check for `make_current` and the subsequent call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional checks are not properly handling the `make_current` parameter, and it is not properly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks and the logic related to the `make_current` parameter. We should also make sure to handle the case when `make_current` is False.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    is_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if is_current is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and is_current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should handle the `make_current` parameter properly and pass the failing test.
