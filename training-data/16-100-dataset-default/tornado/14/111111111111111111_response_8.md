The bug is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The bug is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly triggering the `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` because it's not necessary to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        # Handle the case where make_current is explicitly set to False
        pass
    else:
        raise ValueError("make_current should be True, False, or None")
```

This updated code removes the unnecessary check for the current `IOLoop` instance and ensures that `make_current` is either `True`, `False`, or `None`.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the bug should be resolved. This updated code also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report.
