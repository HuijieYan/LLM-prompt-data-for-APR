The issue is occurring because the condition `if make_current is None` is not checking for the correct object. Additionally, the call to `self.make_current()` should be made within the `initialize` function, not as a separate function call.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements of the `initialize` function, specifically in the way it is handling the `make_current` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking the condition for creating a current IOLoop. Additionally, the function is not calling `make_current` correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this fixed version, we use `self.current(instance=False)` to check for the presence of the current IOLoop, and we call `self.make_current()` to create a new IOLoop when necessary. We also adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the different cases.

With this fix, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter and the current IOLoop creation correctly based on the input parameter. The fixed code also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
