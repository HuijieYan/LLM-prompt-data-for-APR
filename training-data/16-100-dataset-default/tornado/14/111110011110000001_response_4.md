1. The IOLoop class has a method called initialize that takes a make_current argument. This method is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if make_current is True. The failing test test_force_current is trying to create an IOLoop with make_current=True and then create another IOLoop with make_current=True, which should raise a RuntimeError. However, the existing implementation of the initialize method does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the RuntimeError.

2. The potential error location within the initialize function is the conditional check for make_current. When make_current is True, the initialize method should first check if there is already a current IOLoop, and if so, raise a RuntimeError; otherwise, it should make the current IOLoop.

3. The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the initialize method does not properly handle the case when make_current is True. It does not check if a current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop, which leads to the RuntimeError in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the conditional checks in the initialize method to correctly handle the make_current argument and check for the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current IOLoop.
   - Ensure that the behavior of the initialize method aligns with the expectations and requirements from the failing test.

5. Here's the corrected code for the initialize method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated method first checks if make_current is None and then if make_current is True, and handles each case appropriately by checking for the existence of a current IOLoop before making it the current IOLoop. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
