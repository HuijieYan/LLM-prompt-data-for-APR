The main issue in the buggy code is with the condition in the initialize function. The condition `if make_current is None` should check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and then call `self.make_current()` if it does not exist. Additionally, the condition `elif make_current` should only raise an error if there is already a current IOLoop instance.

The problem is that the code is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly. It is raising an error even if `make_current=True` and there is no current IOLoop instance.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, specifically in the `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly as described above.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code checks the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop instance and then calls `self.make_current()` or raises an error accordingly.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should also pass the failing test case.
