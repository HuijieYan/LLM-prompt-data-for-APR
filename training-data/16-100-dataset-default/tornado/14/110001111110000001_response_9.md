Potential error location: 
The error is occurring at the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

Bug's cause:
The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes a `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is provided and is True, it also checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. The error message indicates that a current IOLoop already exists, suggesting that the logic to check for the existence of the current IOLoop is faulty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists needs to be corrected.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter also needs to be reevaluated and potentially restructured to ensure that the initialization process is handled correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None and make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected code, the `initialize` function now properly checks for an existing IOLoop instance before attempting to make the current instance. This should resolve the RuntimeError that was occurring in the failing test.
