1. The buggy function `initialize` takes a `make_current` parameter and calls `make_current` and `IOLoop.current` functions from the same file. The intention of the function is to initialize the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks and the invocation of the `make_current` function.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). In the conditional checks, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is called without the `IOLoop` class reference, which can cause an error.
   (b). The function `make_current` is called without the `self` reference, which can also cause an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the proper class reference for calling the `IOLoop.current` function.
   - Use the `self` reference for calling the `make_current` function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
