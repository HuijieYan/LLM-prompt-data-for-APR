1. The function `initialize` is checking whether `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if it is True and then raises an error if an IOLoop current instance already exists. The GitHub issue relates to the confusion about why an error is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. 

2. The potential error location within the function is in the logic for checking whether an IOLoop current instance exists. 

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when `make_current` is `True` but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which does not align with the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Revise the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.
   - Adjust the error raising logic to accurately reflect the condition under which an error should be raised.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This revised function handles the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance. It also adjusts the error raising logic to properly handle the conditions. This should address the bug and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
