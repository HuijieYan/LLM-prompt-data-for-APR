The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`. The function takes an optional argument `make_current` and contains conditional logic based on the value of `make_current`. This function is related to the `current` and `make_current` functions within the same class, which are used within the conditional statements. The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" implies that there is a contradiction in the logic around line 252.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if make_current is None`. Depending on the value of `make_current`, the function either checks if the current IOLoop instance is None or raises an error if the current instance already exists. This is contradictory and could cause unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause lies in the inconsistent handling of the `make_current` argument and the logic used to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The GitHub issue further emphasizes the confusion around the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and why an error is raised for "already exists".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Revising the conditional statements to have consistent logic for handling the `make_current` argument and checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
2. Checking if the value of `make_current` is None, and then only making the current IOLoop instance if it is None.
3. Ensuring that the error is only raised if an instance already exists and `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In this corrected code, the logic has been revised to ensure that the handling of the `make_current` argument and the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance are consistent. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure the function behaves as expected.
