1. The buggy function `initialize` is used to set the current IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub states that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but the code still raises a "current IOLoop already exists" error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements where the current IOLoop instance is being checked and the error is raised.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statements in the `initialize` function are not handling the situation when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None properly. The issue on GitHub points out this discrepancy.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before raising an error
   b. Handling the case when the current instance is None and then setting it

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we use this variable to check for its existence and handle the conditions accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
