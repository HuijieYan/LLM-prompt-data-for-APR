1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. It has a conditional logic to check if the `make_current` argument is provided and whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then verify that the current `IOLoop` is set accordingly. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check is evaluating to `None`.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the conditional logic that checks if `make_current` is `True`. 

3. 
   (a). The buggy function `initialize` is using incorrect conditional logic to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.
   (b). The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance and verify the current `IOLoop` setting.
   (c). The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised, suggesting that the conditional check in `initialize` is not working as expected.
   (d). The GitHub issue title suggests that there is confusion about why the `RuntimeError` is being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that it correctly handles the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
   - Check the logic in the `IOLoop.current` function to see if it is returning the expected value.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code ensures that the `make_current` logic is handled appropriately and fixes the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
