The problem in the buggy function lies in the condition where it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None or not None. This condition seems to be contradictory and is likely causing the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem. The function seems to be trying to check if an IOLoop current instance already exists, but the condition is not logically consistent.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the condition in a way that it accurately checks if an IOLoop current instance already exists and then handle the make_current accordingly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a try-except block to catch the RuntimeError when attempting to make the current instance. If a RuntimeError is caught, it means that the IOLoop current instance already exists and should not be made again.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        try:
            self.make_current()
        except RuntimeError:
            pass
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the buggy function now properly checks for the existence of an IOLoop current instance and handles the make_current action accordingly. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.
