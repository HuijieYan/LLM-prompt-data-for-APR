The issue with the code is that the `make_current` attribute is not being handled correctly. The function is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is True, it should also call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `make_current` is None or if it's explicitly True. Then we check if the current IOLoop instance already exists, and if it does, we raise a RuntimeError. If the checks pass, we then call `self.make_current()`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and handle the `make_current` attribute correctly.
