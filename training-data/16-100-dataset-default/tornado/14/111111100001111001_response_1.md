The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` argument. 

The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is True, it should make the new IOLoop the current one, or if it is None, it should only make the new IOLoop the current one if there is no current instance of IOLoop. 

However, the function is not correctly checking for the current instance of IOLoop. Also, it is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is False.

To fix the bug, we can make the following changes:
1. When `make_current` is None, check if the current instance is not None, and if so, return without making the new IOLoop the current one.
2. When `make_current` is True, check if the current instance is not None, and if so, raise a RuntimeError. If the current instance is None, make the new IOLoop the current one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    is_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if is_current is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if is_current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
