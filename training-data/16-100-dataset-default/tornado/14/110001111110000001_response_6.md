The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True. The problem occurs when `make_current` is True, and there is already a current IOLoop instance. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`, but it instead raises the error when there is no current IOLoop instance.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the condition checking for `make_current`. When `make_current` is True, the function should check if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if so, raise a `RuntimeError` at that point.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking for a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True, instead of when it's None.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. We also need to ensure that the `make_current` function is being called with the correct parameters.

The corrected function should look like this:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function properly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True, and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists. This should make the failing test pass.
