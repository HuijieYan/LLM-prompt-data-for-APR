The potential error location in the buggy function is at the condition where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before raising a `RuntimeError`. The issue on GitHub indicates that it is raising "already exists" even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually None.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the modification to the conditional statements, the function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
