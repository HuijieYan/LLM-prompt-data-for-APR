Potential Error: The bug is likely located in the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class. The issue appears to be with the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

Cause of the Bug: The `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is not provided. It is also not properly checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.

Possible Fix:
1. Check if `make_current` is None. If it is, then check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If not, make the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is provided and is True, then check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If not, raise a RuntimeError. If it does exist, make the current instance.

Corrected Code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # ... (other class functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the logic should properly handle the case when `make_current` is not provided and also correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when needed.
