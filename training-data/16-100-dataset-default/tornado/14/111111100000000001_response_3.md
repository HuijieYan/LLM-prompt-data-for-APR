1. The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` file. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop, and optionally making it the current IOLoop.

2. The potential error in the function is the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` and the subsequent call to `self.make_current()`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement is checking if the current IOLoop is None, and if so, it is making the IOLoop instance as the current one. However, the way the `IOLoop.current` function is called and the comparison with `None` is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where we check the current IOLoop instance. We can also simplify the logic to handle the `make_current` argument more effectively.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary conditional statement for `make_current` being None, as it is not needed. We have also simplified the logic to check if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, make the current instance.
