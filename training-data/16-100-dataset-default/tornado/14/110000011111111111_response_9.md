The issue with the buggy function is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop is None and then raises a RuntimeError if it is. However, the intention seems to be that it should raise the error if the IOLoop already exists. This is why the failing test is raising an error when trying to create a second IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

To fix this, we should update the condition to check if the IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`. 

Additionally, we need to update the `initialize` function to take self as the first parameter, even though it is not shown in the failing test. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will check if the IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`, and will raise a RuntimeError if it does.

This should resolve the failing test and also address the issue posted on GitHub.
