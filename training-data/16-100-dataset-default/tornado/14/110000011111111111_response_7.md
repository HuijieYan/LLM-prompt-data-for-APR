The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it immediately checks if the current IOLoop is None and raises an error if it is not. This is incorrect because if `make_current` is True, then it should create the current IOLoop if it does not already exist.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, and then it expects to raise a RuntimeError when attempting to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but it ends up raising the error "current IOLoop already exists" when creating the first IOLoop.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" highlights the confusion regarding the handling of IOLoop.current being None or not None in the code.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True. It should create the current IOLoop if it does not already exist, and only raise an error if it does exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and will pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
