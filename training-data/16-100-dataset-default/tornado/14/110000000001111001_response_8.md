The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional statements. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop, but the current implementation has some issues.

The bug is caused by the condition `if make_current is None`, which does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, the `make_current` method is not defined in the given function.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional statements to properly handle the different cases of `make_current`. We can also assume that there is a method called `make_current` that should be called when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            # Assuming make_current is a method
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            # Assuming make_current is a method
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should handle the different cases of `make_current` and call the `make_current` method when necessary.
