The issue is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class on line 252. The problem arises from the logic used to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The bug's cause is a logical error in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, in the current implementation, the logic is incorrectly structured, leading to the erroneous behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional logic inside the `initialize` method to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will first check if `make_current` is set to `True`. If it is, and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, the method will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

After making this change, the failing test should pass, and the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, the GitHub issue will be resolved with this fix.
