The issue with the buggy function `initialize` is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. 

The function first checks if `make_current` is not provided and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. If both conditions are met, it then calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is provided and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it should raise a `RuntimeError` instead of calling `self.make_current()`. This is causing the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to correctly handle the different scenarios with the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable to avoid redundant calls. Then we check the different conditions based on the `make_current` parameter and the `current_instance` variable to handle them appropriately.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the GitHub issue by addressing the inconsistent behavior in handling the `make_current` parameter.
