# The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

The issue with the original function is that it didn't handle the case when make_current is True. The corrected version of the function checks if make_current is None or True, and then proceeds to check if the IOLoop.current instance exists or not before making it current. It also checks for the case when make_current is True to raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists.
