The buggy function is a method called "initialize" that takes a parameter "make_current". The issue on GitHub points out that on line 252 the function checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is, it either calls self.make_current() or raises a RuntimeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. These conditional statements are not properly handling the case where the IOLoop.current() already exists.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case where the IOLoop.current() already exists properly. It checks if it's None, and if it is, it tries to make it current. However, if it's not None and make_current is True, it should raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to properly handle the case where the IOLoop.current() already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current IOLoop in a variable called current_ioloop. Then, we modify the conditional statements to use this variable for checking the existence of the current IOLoop. This ensures that the function properly handles the case where the IOLoop.current() already exists.
