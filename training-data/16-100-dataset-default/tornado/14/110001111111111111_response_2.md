The bug in the initialize function lies in the condition where make_current is True. The bug causes a RuntimeError to be raised when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, which is not the expected behavior.

The failing test indicates that when make_current=True, the IOLoop should be created and become the current IOLoop. If another attempt is made to create a new current IOLoop with make_current=True, a RuntimeError should be raised, but the existing IOLoop should remain the current IOLoop.

The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy between the condition that checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and the subsequent RuntimeError being raised. It questions why the RuntimeError is raised when the check for None is successful.

To fix the bug, the condition where make_current is True needs to be modified. Instead of raising a RuntimeError when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, the new IOLoop should be created and become the current IOLoop. Additionally, a check should be added to raise a RuntimeError if there is an attempt to create a new current IOLoop when one already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. Additionally, this correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
