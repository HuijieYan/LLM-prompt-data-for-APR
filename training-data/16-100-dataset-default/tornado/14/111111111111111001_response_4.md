Potential error location: the `make_current` argument is not being used correctly in the `initialize` method.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` is not present, it calls `make_current` to set the current `IOLoop`.
(b). The failing test initializes an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. This should set the current `IOLoop` and raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `make_current` argument in the failing test is meant to set the current `IOLoop` and should not cause a new `IOLoop` to become current if one already exists.

Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    try:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    except TypeError:
        pass
```

With this correction, the `make_current` argument in the failing test will correctly set the current `IOLoop` and raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`.
