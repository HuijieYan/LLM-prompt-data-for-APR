Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, particularly in the logic that checks whether a current `IOLoop` already exists.

Bug's Cause:
The `initialize` method is creating a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then calling the `make_current` method. However, the subsequent call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` always returns `None`, causing the new `IOLoop` instance to be considered as the current `IOLoop`. This behavior is incorrect and does not adhere to the intended logic, leading to test failures.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` method to properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make the new instance the current one. We can also refactor the code to handle the scenarios where `make_current` is not explicitly provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions and class documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make a new one, and making sure to handle the different scenarios for `make_current`, the corrected code should now pass the failing test and behave as expected.
