1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the IOLoop with the option to make it the current IOLoop. It checks if an IOLoop is already current, and if not, it sets itself as the current IOLoop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement where it checks whether to make the current IOLoop.

3. The cause of the bug:
   - The `if make_current is None` condition is checking for the wrong value. It should be checking for a `True` value instead of `None`.
   - The `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` condition is also incorrect as it should be checking for an existing current IOLoop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is not True`.
   - Change the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current() is not None`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (Other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not True:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
