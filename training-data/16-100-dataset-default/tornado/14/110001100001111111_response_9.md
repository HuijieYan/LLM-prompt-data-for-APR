The bug in the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case when make_current is True. 

When make_current is True, it should check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None. If it is not None, then it should raise the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". If it is None, then it should call self.make_current().

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the make_current parameter correctly in both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case when make_current is True, checking for the existence of current IOLoop and raising an error when necessary.

As a result, the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
