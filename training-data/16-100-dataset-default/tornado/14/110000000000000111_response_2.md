Analysis:
The buggy function 'initialize' is supposed to set the current IOLoop, but there seems to be a logic issue that is causing the problem.

Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the 'initialize' function's handling of the 'make_current' parameter. It checks if 'make_current' is None and if the current IOLoop is also None, then it calls 'make_current'. However, if 'make_current' is True and the current IOLoop is not None, it raises a RuntimeError.

Bug's cause:
The bug occurs because when 'make_current' is True, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError even if the current IOLoop does not exist.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of the current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.
2. Remove the unnecessary checks and simplify the logic to make it clearer.

Corrected code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
  
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected code first checks for the presence of the current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current IOLoop. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
