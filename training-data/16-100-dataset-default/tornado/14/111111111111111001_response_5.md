The issue with the buggy function is that it initializes the `IOLoop` instance incorrectly, leading to the `make_current` flag not being properly handled. This results in the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` flag. In the case when `make_current` is True, we should always attempt to make the current `IOLoop` unless there is already a current instance. If `make_current` is False, we should not attempt to become the current `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `make_current` flag will be handled correctly, ensuring that the correct behavior is exhibited based on the provided value.

The corrected function should now allow the failing test to pass and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
