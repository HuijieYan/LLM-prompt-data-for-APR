The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop, but it has a bug that causes the RuntimeError to be incorrectly raised. The issue arises from the logic inside the function when trying to handle the `make_current` parameter.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to initialize an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and expects a RuntimeError to be raised when trying to create a second IOLoop with `make_current=True`. However, the bug in the `initialize` function causes the RuntimeError to be incorrectly raised when it shouldn't.

The code currently checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, it calls `self.make_current()` but also checks if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is, it raises RuntimeError.

The issue posted on GitHub also relates to the incorrect handling of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` when it's None.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function should be changed to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this fix, the function checks if `make_current` is None or True, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it raises a RuntimeError.

This corrected code should make the failing test pass, and also addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
