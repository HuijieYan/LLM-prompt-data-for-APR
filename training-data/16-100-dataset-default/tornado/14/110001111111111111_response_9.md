The issue is in the `initialize` function where the condition to check for the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect. The issue is identified in the `elif` block where it is checking `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This check is incorrect as it should be checking if the instance is not None, meaning that an IOLoop already exists.

So the cause of the bug is that the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect, leading to the wrong error being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None, indicating that an IOLoop already exists.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test, and the GitHub issue should be resolved as well.
