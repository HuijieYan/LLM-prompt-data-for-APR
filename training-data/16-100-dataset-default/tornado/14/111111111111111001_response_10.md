The problematic function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and it is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The problem arises from the `make_current` parameter, which is used to determine whether the new IOLoop should become the current IOLoop instance. The issue is that the current logic does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

To address this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current instance of `IOLoop`. 

Here's a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the `initialize` function now properly checks whether there is an existing current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is set to `True`, and raises a `RuntimeError` if necessary.

This updated logic will resolve the issue and ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test case and satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
