The buggy function "initialize" is meant to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes a parameter "make_current" to specify whether to make the IOLoop instance the current instance. The issue in the code is in the condition where it checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The condition is not being checked correctly, leading to the error being falsely raised.

The failing test "test_force_current" is trying to create an IOLoop instance with make_current=True, then checks if the current IOLoop is the same as the one just created. It then tries to create another IOLoop instance with make_current=True and expects a RuntimeError to be raised.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when trying to create a second IOLoop instance with make_current=True. This is consistent with the failing test that expects the RuntimeError to be raised in this scenario.

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the condition IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, but it still raises the "already exists" error. This indicates that the code is not correctly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists needs to be updated. It should only raise the RuntimeError if make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here is the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test "test_force_current" should pass without raising the RuntimeError, and it also resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
