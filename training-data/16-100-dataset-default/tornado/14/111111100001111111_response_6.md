There are several issues in the buggy function `initialize`:

1. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` should be called as a method of the class, but it is being called as a standalone function. This is incorrect.
2. In the case when `make_current` is `True`, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should raise an error, but instead, it calls `self.make_current()`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
```

With these changes, the function will now correctly check if the current IOLoop exists and make it current based on the value of `make_current`.

In addition, the GitHub issue title and detailed description should be updated to reflect the changes made to the function and the problem that was identified and fixed.
