1. The buggy function "initialize" is designed to initialize an IOLoop object but has a problem with the logic for checking if the IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `if make_current is None`.

3. Discussion of the bug's cause:
   (a) In the buggy function, the logic for checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists is flawed. 
   (b) According to the GitHub issue, the function mistakenly raises an error for a condition where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, even though it should not. This means that the condition is not properly handling the existing IOLoop instance.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Modify the conditional checks to correctly identify if an IOLoop instance already exists.
   (b) Adjust the flow of the function to handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance when necessary.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` has been added to properly check for the existence of an IOLoop instance before raising an error. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
