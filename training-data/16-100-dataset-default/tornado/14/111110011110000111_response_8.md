The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function does not check if there is already a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current one. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised even when the current IOLoop does not exist.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then verify that it is the current IOLoop. However, this test fails with a RuntimeError and the error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists.

The GitHub issue is titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" and it questions why the RuntimeError is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there is already a current IOLoop before attempting to make the current one. This will ensure that the RuntimeError is not raised unnecessarily, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.

By using this correction the issue raised in the GitHub post is also resolved.
