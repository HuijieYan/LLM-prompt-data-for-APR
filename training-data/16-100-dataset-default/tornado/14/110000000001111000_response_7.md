# The updated and corrected function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I removed the elif condition and simply used else to handle the case when make_current is not None. This will ensure that the logic properly checks if a current IOLoop exists and makes it current if it doesn't. If make_current is True, it will raise an error if a current IOLoop already exists and make it current if it doesn't.
