1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and making it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional check for whether a current IOLoop exists or not, which is causing the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if a current IOLoop exists. If not, it calls the `make_current` function to make the IOLoop current.
   (b) The `current` function in the same class is meant to check if an instance of IOLoop is the current IOLoop, but its usage is incorrect in the `initialize` function.
   (c) The `make_current` function is called to make a particular IOLoop instance the current instance, but the condition for raising an error is incorrect in the `initialize` function.
   (d) The GitHub issue information points out that on line 252, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checking for a current IOLoop and then raises an error, which seems contradictory.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the usage of the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `initialize` function to ensure that the current IOLoop is handled correctly.
   - Adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to accurately determine whether to set the IOLoop as the current instance or raise an error.
   - Ensure that the logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop is consistent and accurate.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, the conditional check for `make_current` has been adjusted, and the condition for raising an error has been updated to accurately handle the case where a current IOLoop exists. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.
