# Fixed version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

I have fixed the function by changing "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" to just "current(instance=False)" as it is the correct function to call. I have also adjusted the condition for raising the RuntimeError to check if current IOLoop does exist instead of checking if it is None.
