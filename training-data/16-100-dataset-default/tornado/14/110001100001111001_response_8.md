The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect usage of the `make_current` parameter. The function is defined to accept a parameter `make_current`, but it should call the `make_current` function if `make_current` is not provided. Additionally, the function should call `IOLoop.current` instead of `current` and both `IOLoop` and `make_current` should be accessed using `self`.

Based on the input values and types provided, it seems that the bug is caused by the `make_current` function not being called when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the input parameters and their types will be correctly handled and the `make_current` function will be called based on the provided input parameter.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided above. This code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the bug.
