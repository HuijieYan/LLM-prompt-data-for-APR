1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class. The error message shows that the issue comes from the `initialize` function when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

2. The potential error location is the `if` condition for the `make_current` argument when it is set to `True`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly. It is not correctly checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, which results in the `RuntimeError`.

4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. It should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and conditionally make the current `IOLoop` based on the value of `make_current`.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # existing functions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists based on the value of the `make_current` argument, and conditionally makes the current `IOLoop`. This should satisfy the failing test.
