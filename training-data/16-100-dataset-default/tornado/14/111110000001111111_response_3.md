The problem with the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the `make_current` parameter, and the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` exists is flawed.

Within the `initialize` function, if `make_current` is `True`, it is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` exists and raise an error if it does. However, the condition checks if it is None and then raises an error, which is incorrect.

Additionally, when `make_current` is not given, the function tries to make the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't exist, but the logic for this is also incorrect.

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" does not provide much additional insight.

To fix the bug:
1. We should check if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` exists, and if so, raise an error.
2. If `make_current` is not given, we should make the current `IOLoop` only if it doesn't already exist.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` before making it current. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and align with the expected input/output variable information.
