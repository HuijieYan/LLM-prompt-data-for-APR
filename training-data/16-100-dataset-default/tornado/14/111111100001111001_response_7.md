The current issue with the `initialize` function is that it's not correctly checking for the current instance of the `IOLoop` and making it current based on the `make_current` argument. 

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is True, the function should check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, and if it does, raise a RuntimeError. If it doesn't exist, then it should make the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling these conditions properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the current instance of `IOLoop` before making it current. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
