The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance, optionally making it the current instance if the `make_current` parameter is set to True. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the case when a new instance is being initialized with the same `make_current` parameter as an existing current instance.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to True, and then verify that it becomes the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling this scenario properly, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, we can update the `initialize` function to check for the existence of a current instance and then handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that a new instance is made current without any issues. This updated code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the provided input/output variable information.
