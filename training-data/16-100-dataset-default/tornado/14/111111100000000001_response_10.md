1. The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance and optionally make it the current instance. The `make_current` parameter is used to determine whether the IOLoop instance should become the current instance. The function also calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same class.

2. The potential error in the `initialize` function lies in the conditional statement that checks whether an IOLoop instance is already the current instance. 

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not doing what it is intended to do. This is causing the function to incorrectly handle the case where an IOLoop instance is already the current instance.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement to properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance is already the current instance.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance and current_instance is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, when `make_current` is set to `True`, we first check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and if it is not the same as the current instance. If so, we raise an error. Otherwise, we set the current instance to the new `IOLoop`. This should resolve the bug and properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance is already the current instance.
