The issue with the function is that it's not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It is supposed to only create an instance of `IOLoop` as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is set to `True` and there isn't already a current `IOLoop` instance. The failing test is trying to create two instances with `make_current=True`, and the second instance is failing as expected, but it's not handling it properly.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will first check if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, it will check if there is already a current `IOLoop`. If there is, it will raise a `RuntimeError`. If there isn't, it will make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None`, it will check if there is a current `IOLoop` and if not, it will make the current `IOLoop`.

This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
