The issue is with the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, where it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before making the new one current. If the `make_current` parameter is `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, which is not happening.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled in the `initialize` method, which leads to the incorrect check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements within the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Ensuring that if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises the `RuntimeError` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance, ensuring that it raises the `RuntimeError` if necessary.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
