1. The buggy function "initialize" is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes a parameter "make_current" which is a function. It calls the functions "IOLoop.current" and "make_current" from the same file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check if "make_current" is None or not, and then it calls the "make_current" function.

3. The bug's cause is the incorrect usage of the "make_current" function and the conditional statements. The "make_current" function is not being called properly, and the condition checks are not accurate.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the "make_current" function is being called correctly.
   - Revise the conditional statements to accurately check for the conditions.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
In the corrected code, the conditional statements are adjusted to properly check for the conditions and call the "make_current" function. The "make_current" function is called if "make_current" is None or True, and if "make_current" is False, then it raises an error if the current IOLoop already exists.
