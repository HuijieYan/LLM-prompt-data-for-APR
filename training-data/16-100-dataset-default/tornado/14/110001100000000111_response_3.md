The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` function if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. If `make_current` is not None, then it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statement `if make_current is None`, where it should be checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before calling `self.make_current()`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect check in the conditional statement. The GitHub issue also highlights the confusion regarding the logic behind the error message being raised.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be adjusted to correctly handle the checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the conditional statement for `make_current` has been updated to properly check whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising a `RuntimeError`. The unnecessary `elif` check has been removed as well.
