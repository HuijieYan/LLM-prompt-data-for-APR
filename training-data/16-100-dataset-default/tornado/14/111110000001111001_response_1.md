The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists, it is trying to make the current instance without checking.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition for `make_current=True` to first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and only then make it the current instance. If the current instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError` as specified.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is handled appropriately.
