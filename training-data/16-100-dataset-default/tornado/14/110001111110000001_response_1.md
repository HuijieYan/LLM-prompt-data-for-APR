The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop instance if necessary. The problem arises in the `initialize` function due to the incorrect call to `make_current` without using the `self` keyword, and the check for an existing current IOLoop is only being performed when `make_current` is True.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True`, which should fail with a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` function does not handle this situation correctly, hence the test fails with the `RuntimeError` message.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance regardless of the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is True and there is an existing IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `initialize` function first checks if `make_current` is None or True. If it is, it then checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If not, it calls `self.make_current()` to make the current IOLoop instance.

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.
