The bug is located within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The error is occurring when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise an error, but instead, it tries to make the new `IOLoop` current.

The potential cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists is incorrect. It should check if the instance is already a current `IOLoop` and not create a new one. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` method to first check if `make_current` is set to `True` and then check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, raise a `RuntimeError`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test for the `force_current` function should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new current `IOLoop` instance.
