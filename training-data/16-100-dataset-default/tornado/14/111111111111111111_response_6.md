The issue is occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the part where it checks if `make_current` is `True`. The problem is that it is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for raising the `RuntimeError`. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the method will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
