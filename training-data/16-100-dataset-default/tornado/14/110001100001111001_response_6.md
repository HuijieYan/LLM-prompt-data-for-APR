The problem in the buggy function is that it is trying to call the `make_current` method without accessing it through the `self` parameter. Additionally, the `IOLoop.current` function is being called without referring to the correct module.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `initialize` function to correctly call the `make_current` method through the `self` parameter, and to reference the `current` function from the same module.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly call the `make_current` method and reference the `current` function from the same module, addressing the bug.
