1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class. It is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance, and it checks if a current instance already exists before making itself the current instance. The related functions are `current` and `make_current`, which are also in the same class.

The GitHub issue title indicates that there is an issue with the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent raise of "already exists".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the `if make_current is None` block.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `if make_current is None` block checks if a current instance exists, and if not, it makes the current instance. However, in the following `elif` block, it checks the same condition and raises an error if a current instance exists. This is contradictory.

4. To fix the bug, we can revise the logic in the `initialize` method. We can remove the first `if make_current is None` block and always attempt to make the current instance. Then, if `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`, we can avoid attempting to make the current instance.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly checks the condition based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is not explicitly set to `False`, it attempts to make the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises an error if a current instance already exists.
