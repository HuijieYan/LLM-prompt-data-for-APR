The issue with the buggy function lies in the `initialize` method where the `make_current` argument is not being properly handled.

The bug's cause is that the `make_current` argument is not being processed correctly, and there is confusion between the class method `make_current` and the input argument `make_current`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` argument is used to determine whether to call the `make_current` method of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now properly uses the `make_current` argument to call the class method `make_current` when needed.

Now, with the corrected code provided, the function should behave as expected for the input parameters.
