1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the class `IOLoop`. It takes an argument `make_current` and checks if an `IOLoop` instance is the current instance by calling the `current` method from `IOLoop` class. It also calls the `make_current` method from the same class based on the condition.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if make_current is None:` and `elif make_current:`. There might be an issue with the comparison and the logic flow.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function compares the `make_current` argument with `None` and then directly with `True`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the argument might not be explicitly `True`, even if it's not `None`.
   (b). The class `IOLoop` contains the `initialize` method, which has the bug. The `initialize` method checks for the current instance and makes it current based on the `make_current` argument.
   (c). The related functions `current` and `make_current` are used within the `initialize` method for checking and setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use an explicit check for `make_current` being `True` or `False` instead of relying on truthiness, and use `is None` for checking `None` values.
   - Simplify the logic to make it more understandable and less error-prone.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, we explicitly check for `None` using `is None` and use logical not `if not` to check for the absence of current `IOLoop` instance. We also directly use `make_current` in the `else` condition for better clarity.
