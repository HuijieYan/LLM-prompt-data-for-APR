1. The given function is intended to initialize an IOLoop object. It checks if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, creates a new one.

2. The potential error location is in the if make_current is None block, where the self.make_current() method is called. There is also a redundant if condition with the same condition inside the elif block.

3. The cause of the bug is that the if condition for make_current is not properly handled, and the logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is flawed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Remove the redundant if condition in the elif block
   - Handle the make_current is None condition properly

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Removed the redundant if condition
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed the condition to check if IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
