# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the logic of the `initialize` function has been adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. The condition `if make_current is None` has been replaced with `if make_current` and the logic inside the condition has been updated accordingly. Additionally, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop exists has been adjusted to handle the correct scenario.
