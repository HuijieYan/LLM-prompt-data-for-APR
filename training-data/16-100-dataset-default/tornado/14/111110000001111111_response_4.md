The issue arises due to incorrectly checking whether the current IOLoop instance exists. The `make_current` function is called if `make_current` is None and there is no current IOLoop instance, or if `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This leads to a contradiction and can cause the "already exists" error to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` function should be modified to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and remove the contradiction.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this correction, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance`, and then use this variable for checking whether a current IOLoop instance exists or not. This ensures that there is no contradiction in the logic and that the function behaves as expected.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information by correctly handling the `make_current` parameter and should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
