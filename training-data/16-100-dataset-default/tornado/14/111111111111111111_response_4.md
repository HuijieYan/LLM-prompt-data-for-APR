Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue lies within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The problem occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, which should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The cause of the bug is that the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is performed with the `instance=False` parameter, causing the check to always return as `None`, even if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

To resolve this issue, the check for the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be performed without passing the `instance=False` parameter, so that it accurately determines if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Remove the `instance=False` parameter from the `IOLoop.current()` function call within the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will accurately check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance, and the provided failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`. This correction also addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
