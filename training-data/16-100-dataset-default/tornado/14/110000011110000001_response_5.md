1. The buggy function is `initialize` which is a method of a class, but it doesn't seem to be part of a class. It appears to be a method of a class that extends the `IOLoop` class. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then create another `IOLoop` instance with the same argument, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method where the `make_current` argument is checked and the `RuntimeError` is raised.

3. The bug's cause is that the `initialize` method does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the method does not handle this situation as expected, which results in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the conditional statements in the `initialize` method to properly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. Another approach could be to refactor the `initialize` method to ensure it works correctly with the `make_current` argument.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, modified to handle the `make_current` argument properly and pass the failing test:

```python
def initialize(self, impl=None, **kwargs):
    if impl is not None:
        super(KQueueIOLoop, self).initialize(impl=impl, **kwargs)
    else:
        super(KQueueIOLoop, self).initialize(**kwargs)

    if self._initialized and kwargs.get('make_current'):
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method properly handles the `make_current` argument and ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. This should allow the failing test to pass without any `RuntimeError`.
