The issue in the `initialize` function arises from inconsistent handling of the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is None, the function checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` and then makes the current instance. However, if `make_current` is True, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` and then raises an error. This is inconsistent and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the issue, the `initialize` function should be updated to handle the `make_current` argument consistently and ensure that it always performs the expected action based on the argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `make_current` argument. If it is None or True, it will check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and raise an error if there is. Otherwise, it will make the current instance.

This correction addresses the inconsistent handling of the `make_current` argument and ensures that the function behaves as expected based on the input parameters.

The updated code will resolve the issue on GitHub and provide a consistent behavior for the `initialize` function.
