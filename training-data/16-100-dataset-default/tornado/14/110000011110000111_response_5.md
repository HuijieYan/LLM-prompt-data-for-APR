Analysis:
The buggy function "initialize" is used to initialize an IOLoop instance. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when the make_current parameter is True, even though IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. This suggests that the logic within the function is incorrect.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition where make_current is True. The function is raising a RuntimeError even when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

Bug's Cause:
The bug's cause is that the function is not checking the make_current flag properly, resulting in a RuntimeError being raised when it should not be.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition where make_current is True to properly check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None before raising a RuntimeError.
2. Adjust the logic to ensure that when make_current is True, the IOLoop is only made current if it does not already exist.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above change, the function will now correctly handle the make_current flag and avoid raising a RuntimeError when it is not necessary. This corrected code should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
