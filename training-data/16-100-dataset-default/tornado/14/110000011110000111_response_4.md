The problem lies in the initialize function of the IOLoop class. The issue is that when make_current is True, the code is checking if IOLoop.current() is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this behavior is incorrect because if IOLoop.current() is None, it should proceed to make the current IOLoop instead of raising an error.

Therefore, the bug is that the code incorrectly raises an error when make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the initialize function to handle the case when make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is None by making the current IOLoop in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected code, the initialize function will check if make_current is True and IOLoop.current() is None, and if so, it will make the current IOLoop. And if IOLoop.current() is not None, it will raise a RuntimeError as before.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
