1. The buggy function is called "initialize" and it is a method of the class "IOLoop". This class is used for creating a level-triggered I/O loop and it has two other methods "current" and "make_current" that are called within the buggy function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements where it checks the value of "make_current".

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling the cases properly when "make_current" is None or True.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check if "make_current" is False and handle that case accordingly.
   - Update the conditional statements to handle the different scenarios more accurately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been updated to accurately handle the cases when "make_current" is None, False, or True. It now properly checks for the presence of a current instance before making the current IOLoop.
