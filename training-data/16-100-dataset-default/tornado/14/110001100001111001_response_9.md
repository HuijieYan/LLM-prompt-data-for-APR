Potential error location: 
The problem seems to be with the if condition `if make_current is None`, which incorrectly checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, instead of `current(instance=False) is None`.

Bug cause:
The function `IOLoop.current()` is called with the incorrect parameters, which results in a runtime error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to fix the condition to call the correct function `current(instance=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
