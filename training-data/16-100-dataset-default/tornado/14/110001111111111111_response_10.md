The issue is with the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The problem arises from the incorrect check for the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to True.

The `initialize` function is called with the `make_current` parameter set to True, but the conditional checks in the function are not handling this scenario correctly. Additionally, the call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not being handled properly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and the call to `IOLoop.current` within the `initialize` function.

The corrected `initialize` function should be as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # change the conditional to check for True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check for current IOLoop instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these modifications, the conditional checks for `make_current` and the call to `IOLoop.current` should now work as intended. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop instance, resolving the bug.

The corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
