1. The buggy function is called `initialize` and it takes a parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`. The function checks if `make_current` is None and if the current IOLoop does not exist, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None and is True, it should check if the current IOLoop exists, and if it does not, it should call `self.make_current()`. If the current IOLoop does exist when `make_current` is True, it should raise a RuntimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition `elif make_current:` which checks whether `make_current` is True.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the code raises a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop does not exist. This is evident from the failing test and error message, which shows that the RuntimeError is being raised even when the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

4. Approach for fixing the bug:
   - Instead of checking `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True, the condition should be inverted to check if the IOLoop already exists, and only call `self.make_current()` if it doesn't.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
