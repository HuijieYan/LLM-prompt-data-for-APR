The issue with the buggy function is that it is calling the `make_current` function incorrectly. The `make_current` function is an instance method of the `IOLoop` class, so it should be called on the instance of the class, rather than as a standalone function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` function is called on the instance of the `IOLoop` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `make_current` function is called on the instance of the class using `self.make_current()`, and the `current` function is also called on the instance of the class using `self.current(instance=False)`.

This corrected code ensures that the `make_current` and `current` functions are being called correctly within the context of the `IOLoop` class.
