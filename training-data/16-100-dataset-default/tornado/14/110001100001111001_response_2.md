The issue in the buggy function is that the `IOLoop.current` function is called without the `IOLoop` class prefix, which causes a NameError. Additionally, the `make_current` function is called incorrectly with `self` as a parameter, but it should be called as a method of the class.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function calls to use the correct class name and method syntax.

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()  # Call the method on the instance
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Call the method on the instance
```

By fixing the function calls to use the correct class name (IOLoop) and calling the method on the instance, the buggy function should now work as expected and satisfy the given input/output variable information.
