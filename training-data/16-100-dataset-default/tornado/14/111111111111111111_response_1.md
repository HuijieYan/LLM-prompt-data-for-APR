The issue seems to be with the `initialize` function where it's incorrectly checking for the `make_current` parameter. The problem is occurring because it's raising a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is set to True and the current `IOLoop` is `None`. 

To fix the issue, we should modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised when `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. This modification should make the failing test pass and address the issue reported on GitHub.
