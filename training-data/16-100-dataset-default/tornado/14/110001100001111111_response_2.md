The bug is in the 'initialize' function at line 252 of ioloop.py. When the 'make_current' parameter is True, the function is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError even when the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. This behavior is not consistent with the expected logic.

To fix this issue, we can modify the 'initialize' function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will only raise a RuntimeError if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and 'make_current' is True. Otherwise, it will proceed with setting the current IOLoop.

This corrected code addresses the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug.
