The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop, and it accepts an argument `make_current` to control whether the new IOLoop should become the current one. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with the logic of the function: on line 252, the function checks if the current IOLoop is None, and if it is, it makes the new IOLoop current. However, the next check raises an error if the current IOLoop is not None, which seems contradictory.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and deciding whether to make the new IOLoop current.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop and deciding whether to make the new IOLoop current is not properly implemented. This is causing contradictory behavior and inconsistency.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be adjusted. It should first check if `make_current` is None, and if so, then check if the current IOLoop instance exists and make the new one current if it doesn't. If `make_current` is not None, it should simply raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # Other functions in the class are ignored for brevity

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the `initialize` function now checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if the current instance is None and makes the new one current if it is. If `make_current` is not None, it simply raises an error if the current instance exists. This aligns with the intended behavior and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
