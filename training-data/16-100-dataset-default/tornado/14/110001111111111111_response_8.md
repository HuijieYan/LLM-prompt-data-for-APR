The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. This contradicts its intended behavior, as it should only raise a RuntimeError if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement `elif make_current:` is checking if `make_current` is True, but it should be checking if it is not None.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to check if `make_current` is not None, and then check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:  # Check if make_current is not None
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
