The problem lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is. However, the current implementation is checking if there is no current instance and then proceeding to make the current instance in either case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # if make_current is not specified
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # if make_current is set to True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `make_current` parameter is correctly checked, and the `RuntimeError` will be raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and will pass the failing test.
