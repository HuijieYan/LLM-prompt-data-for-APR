Potential error location:
The error occurs when the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is called with `make_current=True`. The code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, then it immediately raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

Bug's cause:
The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The code first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, indicating that there is no current IOLoop. However, instead of creating a new IOLoop in that case, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which is inconsistent and causes the test to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `make_current` is True, create a new IOLoop instance instead of checking if the current IOLoop exists.
2. Remove the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True, and simply create a new IOLoop instance.

Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Create a new IOLoop instance
        self.make_current()
```

By following these corrections, the `initialize` function will now create a new IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`, and will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario. This will allow the failing test to pass and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
