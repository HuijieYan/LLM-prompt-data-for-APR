The problematic function `initialize` checks if an instance of `IOLoop` currently exists, and if not, it calls the `make_current` function. However, the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect in checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and calling `make_current` accordingly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then calling `make_current`. The conditional logic is flawed.

The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" suggests that there is confusion about the logic at line 252, where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then raises an error "already exists".

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function needs to be revised. It should first check if `make_current` is provided and then check the existence of the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed the conditional to the else block here
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Changed the condition to raise the error when IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function will now check if `make_current` is provided, and then handle the logic for creating a new `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected code will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report, ensuring that the logic for creating a new `IOLoop` instance and checking for its existence is handled correctly.
