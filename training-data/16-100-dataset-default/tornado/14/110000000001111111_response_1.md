The issue seems to be in the logic of the initialize function in the code. The function checks if make_current is None, and if so, it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is, it calls self.make_current(). However, if make_current is True, it also checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is not, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic seems to be contradictory.

The expected behavior seems to be that if make_current is True, it should check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is, it should call self.make_current(). If it is not None, then it should not do anything. If make_current is None, then it should also not do anything if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, and call self.make_current() only if it is None.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the initialize function should be adjusted to reflect this expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will now behave as expected based on the input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
