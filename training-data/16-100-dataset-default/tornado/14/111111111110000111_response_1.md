The buggy function `initialize` in class `IOLoop` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to initialize a new IOLoop instance. The issue arises when the `make_current` argument is provided and is True. This should make the new IOLoop instance the current one, but due to the existing logic in the function, it erroneously raises a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.

The bug is caused by the conditional check for `make_current` inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True, it raises a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists, which is contradictory to the expected behavior of making the new instance the current one.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` should be modified to only make the new IOLoop instance current when `make_current` is True and there is no current instance. If `make_current` is False or None, the new IOLoop instance should not attempt to make itself current.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the failing test for `test_force_current` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
