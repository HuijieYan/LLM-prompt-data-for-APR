The problematic function "initialize" in the file "tornado/ioloop.py" has a bug that is causing it to fail the test. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and optionally make it current, but it is not handling the "make_current" parameter correctly.

The error location within the function is identified as the "elif make_current" block, where it incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the "make_current" parameter. In the failing test, when "IOLoop(make_current=True)" is called, the buggy "initialize" function incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop already exists and raises a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the "initialize" function should be modified to only check for an existing IOLoop if "make_current" is True. If "make_current" is None, it should default to True, and if it is explicitly False, the IOLoop should not be made current.

Here's the corrected code for the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the "initialize" function now correctly handles the "make_current" parameter. It defaults to True if not specified, and only checks for an existing IOLoop and raises a RuntimeError when "make_current" is True.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and no longer raise a RuntimeError when creating a new IOLoop with "make_current=True".
