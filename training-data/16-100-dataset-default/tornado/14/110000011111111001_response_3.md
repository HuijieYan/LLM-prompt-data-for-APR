The problem with the buggy function is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the `elif make_current` block. The issue is that it is incorrectly checking for the absence of a current IOLoop instance instead of checking for its presence.

Based on the error message and the failing test, it is evident that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and raise an error if a current IOLoop already exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check for the presence of a current IOLoop
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the presence of a current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.
