The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method. 

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current` is set to True, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists; if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the `make_current` argument is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the `initialize` method will properly check if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and only raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub about the inappropriate RuntimeError being raised in the `initialize` method.
