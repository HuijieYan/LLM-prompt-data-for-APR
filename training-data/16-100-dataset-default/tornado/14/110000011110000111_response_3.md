The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional statement that checks the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is None, it calls `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. If `make_current` is True, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, and then checks if `IOLoop.current()` is the same object. However, it fails with a `RuntimeError` because the `make_current` parameter is True, and it raises a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" is related to the confusion regarding the logic in the `initialize` function at line 252. The issue questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True, it should actually check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for `make_current` needs to be modified to properly check whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before raising a `RuntimeError`. This can be achieved by using `if not make_current` instead of `elif make_current`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed from elif make_current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue raised in GitHub should be resolved.
