1. The problematic function `initialize` checks if an `IOLoop` instance is current using the `IOLoop.current` method. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, makes the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an instance exists and raises an error if it does, otherwise it makes the current instance.

The related functions `current` and `make_current` are called within the `IOLoop` class. The GitHub issue reports that line 252 of the `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but then raises "already exists" which seems contradictory.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement that checks if the `IOLoop.current` instance is `None`. This is where the behavior seems contradictory based on the reported issue.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to the logic within the if statement in the `initialize` function. It is possible that the condition to check for the current instance's existence is not properly handled, leading to the unexpected raising of an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include thoroughly reviewing the logic within the if statements, ensuring that the conditions and error handling are correctly implemented. Additionally, the usage of the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `initialize` function should be examined to ensure they align with the expected behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is preserved as it is, as the function should proceed to make the current instance if no instance exists. In the `elif` branch, the condition is changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, and the else statement is added to ensure that the current instance is made when the condition is met. This aligns with the GitHub issue's report of the contradictory behavior.
