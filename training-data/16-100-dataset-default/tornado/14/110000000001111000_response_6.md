# The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current == True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if `make_current` is None or True, and then executed the necessary logic accordingly. We also adjusted the condition inside the `elif` block to ensure that it raises an error if the current IOLoop already exists, and make the IOLoop current otherwise.
