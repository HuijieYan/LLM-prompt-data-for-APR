The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

The bug's cause is that when the `make_current` parameter is True, the code is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. This is conflicting because if `make_current` is True, it means that the IOLoop instance should already exist.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `make_current` is True, and if so, simply call the `make_current` method without checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is not True, then we can keep the existing logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is True, simply make the current instance
        self.make_current()
    else:  # If make_current is False, check if the current instance exists before making it the current instance
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` method will handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub about the conflict between checking if the current instance is None or not.
