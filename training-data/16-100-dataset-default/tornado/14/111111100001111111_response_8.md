The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the logic in the `initialize` function, specifically the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The `make_current` argument controls whether a new IOLoop instance should try to become the current instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only make the instance current if there is no current instance. If `make_current` is True, it should raise an error if there is already a current instance.

The problem occurs when `make_current=None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, it should call `self.make_current()` to make the instance current. Instead, it's currently not doing anything in this case. Additionally, the logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists seems to be incorrect.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

A possible approach to fix the bug:

1. Check if the `make_current` argument is True. If it is, then make the instance current and raise an error if there is already a current instance.
2. If the `make_current` argument is not provided or is False, then only make the instance current if there is no current instance.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub ticket by properly handling the `make_current` argument and current instance existence.
