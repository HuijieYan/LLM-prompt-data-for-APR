The potential error location within the buggy function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. It seems that the logic for checking whether the IOLoop.current instance exists is incorrect, leading to the wrong error message being raised.

The bug's cause is that the conditional statements are not correctly checking for the current IOLoop instance, causing the wrong error message to be raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the conditional statements to properly check the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise the appropriate error message.
2. Update the make_current function to ensure that the current IOLoop is properly created if it does not exist.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current(self)
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current(self)
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the conditional statements to properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise the appropriate error message. We also ensure that the make_current function is properly called to create the current IOLoop instance if it does not exist.
