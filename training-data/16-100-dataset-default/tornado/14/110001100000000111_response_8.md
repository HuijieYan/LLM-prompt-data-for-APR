The problem with the initialize function in ioloop.py is that it is not checking for the existence of an IOLoop object correctly. The if-else condition is not handling the cases properly. Additionally, the make_current function is not being called correctly within the initialize function.

The potential error location is in the if-else condition within the initialize function, where it checks for the existence of IOLoop.current(instance=False).

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of the if-else conditions in the initialize function. It is not properly checking whether an IOLoop object already exists before calling the make_current function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the initialize function to correctly check for the existence of an IOLoop object and call the make_current function accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will first check if an IOLoop object already exists, and if not, it will call the make_current function to create one. If make_current is specified as True, it will explicitly check that an IOLoop object exists before calling make_current, and raise a RuntimeError if one is already present. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
