The potential error location within the problematic function is the line 'self._filled = True'. The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not, but in the function, it is always being set to True, regardless of the input parameter value.

The bug's cause is that the function always sets the marker to be filled, irrespective of the input fillstyle, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to set the self._filled variable based on the input parameter fillstyle. If fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False. Additionally, since the _filled attribute may be toggled by the fillstyle, we need to change the assignment of the self._filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```
