1. The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset a number of attributes and then call `_marker_function()`. However, it is not clear where `_marker_function` is defined or what it is supposed to do. This may be leading to the failing test.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `_marker_function()` at the end. Since `_marker_function` is not explicitly defined within the function, this could be causing the error.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is not properly defined and called within the `_recache` function, leading to a failure in the test for `is_filled()`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define `_marker_function` within the `_recache` function and make sure it resets the necessary attributes.
   - Ensure that the call to `_marker_function` is in accordance with its intended purpose and does not lead to unexpected errors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, we can prevent the error in the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
