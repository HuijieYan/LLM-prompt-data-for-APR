1. The buggy function is called `_recache` and it is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker shape 'o' and fillstyle 'none', and then checks if the fillstyle is indeed 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `True`.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `_recache` function resets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object, including `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle specified during object creation. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
   (b). The failing test is trying to verify that the marker is not filled for a specific fillstyle, but due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the test fails with an assertion error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `_recache` function to take into account the specified fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   (b). Update the `MarkerStyle` class to handle the fillstyle and filled status correctly.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle, which should allow the failing test to pass.
