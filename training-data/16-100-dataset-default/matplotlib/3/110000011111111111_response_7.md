The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

The fix for this bug involves updating the `_filled` attribute based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`.

Potential Error Location:
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, causing it to be incorrect.

Bug's Cause:
The `is_filled()` method checks the `_filled` attribute, and since this attribute is incorrectly set to `False` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`, the method returns the wrong value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`. If the input value is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`, ensuring that the failing test will pass and the issue reported on GitHub will be resolved.
