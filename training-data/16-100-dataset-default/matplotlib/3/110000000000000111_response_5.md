1. The buggy function `_recache` is not directly related to the GitHub issue, but it is responsible for updating internal state variables and then calling the `_marker_function`. The issue on GitHub is related to markers not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function could be in the assignment of the `_filled` variable. If the markers are not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none', then the issue might be related to the `_filled` variable being set to `True` unconditionally.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to markers being filled instead of appearing as hollow. The GitHub issue reflects this problem by showing an example where markers, despite setting `fillstyle` to 'none', do not appear as hollow.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to conditionally set the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers appear as hollow.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False` to ensure that markers appear as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
