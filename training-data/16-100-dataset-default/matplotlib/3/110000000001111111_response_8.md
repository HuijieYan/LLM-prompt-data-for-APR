The buggy function `_recache` is called when a MarkerStyle object is created and expects `self._marker_function` to be a function. However, based on the runtime values provided, it seems that `self._marker_function` is not set correctly. This could be the potential source of the issue.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the `_filled` attribute should be set to `True` in all cases, but it is incorrectly being set to `False` in the buggy function.

The GitHub issue indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the marker's fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow, which matches the behavior described in the actual variable values. This suggests that the bug is causing the fillstyle parameter not to be correctly applied to the markers.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should always be set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the input parameters. This will ensure that the markers are properly filled when the function is called.

Below is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # always set to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will always set the `_filled` attribute to `True`, ensuring that the markers are correctly filled when the function is called. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
