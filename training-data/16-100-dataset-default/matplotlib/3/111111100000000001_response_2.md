1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the matplotlib library. This function is supposed to update certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object, but there are several issues with it.

2. The potential error is within the line `self._marker_function()`, where it is trying to call a function that does not exist.

3. The bug is caused by the _recache function attempting to call a non-existent _marker_function. The _marker_function is not defined within the class, and calling it will result in an AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, the _recache function needs to be updated to correctly update the relevant attributes of the MarkerStyle object.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
```
