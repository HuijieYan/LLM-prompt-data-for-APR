The potential error in the code is that the `_filled` variable is being assigned the value `False` unconditionally, regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This is likely causing the function to not behave as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will now check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` variable accordingly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
