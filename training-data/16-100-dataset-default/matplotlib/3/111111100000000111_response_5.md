The issue is that the MarkerStyle class is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter in the _recache function, resulting in markers not being hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is with the _filled attribute being set to True by default, which conflicts with the intention of setting fillstyle to 'none'.

The bug is caused by the _recache function not properly handling the fillstyle parameter, leading to markers not being hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user sets fillstyle to 'none' but the markers are not hollow as expected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter. This can be done by checking the fillstyle value and setting the _filled attribute accordingly. If fillstyle is set to 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

Additionally, the _marker_function being called at the end of the _recache function should also be checked to ensure it is correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
