1. The buggy function is a part of the matplotlib library and is responsible for recaching some properties related to markers. It appears that the function is meant to reset certain properties to their default values and then call a marker function.

2. The potential error is in the line where it attempts to call `self._marker_function()`, as it does not check if `self._marker_function` is a callable object before trying to call it.

3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `self._marker_function` will always be a callable object without checking for it. This can lead to a runtime error if `self._marker_function` is not a function, which will cause the program to crash.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. This can be done using the `callable()` function in Python.

5. Below is the corrected code with the added check:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the code will only call `self._marker_function()` if it exists and is callable, avoiding any potential runtime errors.
