1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the class `MarkerStyle`. This class is related to the GitHub issue as it is used to customize markers in matplotlib, and the issue is related to the incorrect display of markers when using a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is not overridden by the `fillstyle='none'` parameter.

3. (a). The buggy function:

The `_recache` function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object, including `_filled`, which is always set to `True` no matter what the value of `fillstyle` is.

(b). The buggy class:

The `MarkerStyle` class is used to customize the appearance of markers in matplotlib. The `fillstyle` parameter is intended to control whether markers are hollow or filled, but it is not functioning correctly in the buggy code.

(c). The GitHub issue information:

The issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is taken into account when rendering markers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
