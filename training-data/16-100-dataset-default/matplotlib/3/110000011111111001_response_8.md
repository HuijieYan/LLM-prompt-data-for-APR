The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` instead of `True`. This causes the failing test since `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix this, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to `True` before calling the `_marker_function()`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Update _filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this update, the function will set the `_filled` attribute to `True` before executing the `_marker_function()`, which will make the failing test pass.

This corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and will pass the failing test.
