The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting self._filled to True unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the value of self._marker_function. This means that self._filled is always being set to True, even if it should remain as False.

To fix this, we need to only set self._filled to True if self._marker_function is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Only set _filled to True if _marker_function is not None
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the _filled variable is only set to True when the _marker_function is not None, as expected.
