```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # fix: changed from None to not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # fix: changed from True to False
        self._marker_function()
```

Now the failing test should pass without any errors. The corrected function will correctly set the fillstyle to 'none' and the markers will be rendered as hollow. Also, the GitHub issue title and the detailed description are updated accordingly.
