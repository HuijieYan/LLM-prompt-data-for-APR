The buggy function is a part of the MarkerStyle class in the matplotlib library. The failing test is checking for the is_filled() method of the MarkerStyle class which returns True if the marker is filled and False if it is not.

The potential error location in the _recache function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the _filled attribute to True irrespective of the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle.

The bug is caused because the _recache function is not considering the fillstyle attribute specified when creating the MarkerStyle. As a result, even if the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is being set to True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to consider the fillstyle attribute and set the _filled attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function now considers the fillstyle attribute and sets the _filled attribute accordingly. This will ensure that the failing test will pass.
