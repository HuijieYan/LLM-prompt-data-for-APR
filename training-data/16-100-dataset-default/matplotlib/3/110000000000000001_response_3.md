1. The _recache function is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call the _marker_function if it is not None. However, there are several attributes being set to None without needing to be, and the _marker_function is called without any arguments.

2. The potential error location is within the lines of setting attributes to None unnecessarily and potentially calling _marker_function improperly.

3. The buggy function sets several attributes to None without a clear reason, and then calls _marker_function without any arguments. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

4. To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary setting of certain attributes to None and add an argument to the _marker_function call if necessary.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function(argument)  # replace 'argument' with the appropriate argument for the _marker_function
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary setting of attributes to None has been removed. The _marker_function is only called if it is not None, and an appropriate argument has been added if necessary.
