1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the class `MarkerStyle` in the file `markers.py` in the `matplotlib` library. The function is related to setting up the marker style properties, including the fill style. The GitHub issue mentions that the markers are not hollow when setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is likely to be the line `self._filled = True`, which sets the marker as filled, contradicting the intention to make the marker hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the `_recache` function setting `self._filled` to `True` by default, which contradicts the intention of making the marker hollow through the `fillstyle` parameter. This issue is supported by the GitHub issue, which demonstrates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce the expected hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that the marker is rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This may involve checking the value of the `fillstyle` parameter and adjusting the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_recache`:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, the `_filled` attribute is conditionally set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none', the marker will be rendered as hollow. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
