The problematic function `_recache` is intended to reset several attributes in the class instance to their default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The issue lies in the fact that it is not checking if `_marker_function` is callable before trying to invoke it.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object and checking if it is not filled. However, the error message shows that the `is_filled` method is being called as a bound method, indicating that the `_marker_function` is not being called within the `_recache` function, resulting in the `is_filled` method not being updated.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should check if the `_marker_function` is callable before trying to call it. This will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object's attributes are properly updated when the `_recache` function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix in place, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass without any errors.
