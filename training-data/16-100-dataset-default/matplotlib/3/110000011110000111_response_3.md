1. The buggy function _recache() is called when setting marker styles in matplotlib. The failing test is specifically testing the fillstyle attribute of the MarkerStyle class. The failing test and error message indicate that the is_filled() method of MarkerStyle is not returning the expected result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(), which is supposed to trigger a callback function to update marker properties, but it may not be performing as expected.

3. The bug is causing the MarkerStyle class to not properly handle the fillstyle attribute. The failing test is checking for the expected behavior of the fillstyle 'none' but receiving unexpected results. The GitHub issue also reflects this problem where a user setting the fillstyle to 'none' does not get the desired hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the implementation of the _marker_function() and ensure that it properly updates the marker properties.
   (b). Verify that the MarkerStyle class is correctly checking for the 'none' fillstyle and setting the filled attribute accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the _recache() function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for 'none' fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting self._filled to False for 'none' fillstyle, the corrected function should now properly handle hollow markers. This change should address both the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
