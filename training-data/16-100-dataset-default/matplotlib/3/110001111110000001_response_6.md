1. The _recache function is intended to reinitialize the marker properties when the marker function is called. However, it is not correctly resetting the filled property, which is causing the test case to fail.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of the _filled property to True without checking the fillstyle.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is not taking into account the fillstyle when resetting the filled property, causing the is_filled() method to return True when it should not.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the fillstyle and setting the _filled property accordingly.
   - Adding a condition to handle the fillstyle and set the _filled property based on the fillstyle value.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly set the _filled property based on the fillstyle value, resolving the issue with the failing test case.
