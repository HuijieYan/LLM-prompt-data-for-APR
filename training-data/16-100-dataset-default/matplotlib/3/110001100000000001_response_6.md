1. The function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing the marker properties. It sets default values for various properties and then calls the `_marker_function` to recache the marker.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` as it tries to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is trying to call `_marker_function` without checking if it is assigned or not. This could lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, then it should not be called to avoid errors.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # check if _marker_function is defined
        self._marker_function()  # call _marker_function if it exists
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is None, then it will not be called, avoiding the potential error.
