1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class within the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. This function is responsible for updating certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` as it seems to be attempting to call a function that does not exist.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to call a function named `self._marker_function`, assuming it exists, but it is not defined within the scope of the function.
   (b). The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` function, which is responsible for updating the attributes of the class based on the availability of `_marker_function`.
   (c). The related functions to the `_recache` function that should be called are not explicitly defined or mentioned within the given code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the `_marker_function` within the class and call it if it exists.
   - Use a conditional check to ensure that the `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
