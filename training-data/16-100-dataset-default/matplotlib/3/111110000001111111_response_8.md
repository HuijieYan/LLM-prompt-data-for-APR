1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is meant to re-cache the marker style. It sets various attributes to default values and then calls the _marker_function. The issue reported on GitHub states that when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the filled attribute to True, which contradicts the expected behavior when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is setting the filled attribute to True unconditionally, which overrides the expected behavior when fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in filled markers instead of hollow markers. The GitHub issue also supports this by stating that the expected behavior is not being achieved.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the _recache function to check the fillstyle and set the filled attribute accordingly.
   - Add a condition to set filled to False when fillstyle is 'none'.

5. Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function checks the fillstyle and sets the filled attribute accordingly, ensuring that setting fillstyle to 'none' will result in hollow markers when using ax.scatter(). This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
