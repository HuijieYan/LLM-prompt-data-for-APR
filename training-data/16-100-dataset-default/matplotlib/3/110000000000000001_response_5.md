1. The buggy function is a method called _recache. It is intended to reset several instance variables and then call the _marker_function if it is not None.

2. The potential error lies in calling self._marker_function without checking if it is None, which could cause an AttributeError if it is not defined.

3. The bug is caused by not checking if self._marker_function is defined before calling it. If it is not defined, it will raise an AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
