The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting self._filled to True unconditionally, regardless of the input parameter value. This is causing the function to not consider the actual value of self._filled and always set it to True.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unconditional assignment of self._filled to True and instead set it based on the value of self._fillstyle.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle not in ['none', '']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _recache function will now correctly set the value of self._filled based on the condition of self._fillstyle, as expected. This should address the bug and ensure that the function operates as intended.
