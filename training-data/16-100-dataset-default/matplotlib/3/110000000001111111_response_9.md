1. The `_recache` function sets various attributes of the object to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers hollow using `ax.scatter()` and a custom `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, even when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, leading to markers not being hollow as expected.

3. The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when `'fillstyle'` is set to `'none'` in the `markers.MarkerStyle` object. This discrepancy is evident from the GitHub issue where the user's intention is to set markers hollow, but the markers are not hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the value of `self._fillstyle` and only set `_filled` to `True` if it is not 'none'.
   - Make use of the `fillstyle` attribute from `markers.MarkerStyle` to determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
