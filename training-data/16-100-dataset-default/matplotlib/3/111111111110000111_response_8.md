1. The buggy function _recache is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file in the matplotlib library. The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle is located in the test_marker.py file within the same library. The error message indicates that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the is_filled method of MarkerStyle returns True, which is incorrect. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem, where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not produce the expected hollow markers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _filled attribute. The _filled attribute is set to True unconditionally in the _recache function, which causes the is_filled method to always return True.

3. (a). The buggy function: The _recache function unconditionally sets _filled to True.
   (b). The buggy class: The MarkerStyle class is responsible for defining marker styles in matplotlib.
   (c). The related functions: The failing test calls the is_filled method of MarkerStyle and checks if it returns False.
   (d). The failing test and error message: The failing test checks if marker_style.is_filled() returns False when the fillstyle is set to 'none', but it actually returns True.
   (e). The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not produce the expected hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to correctly set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.
   - Modify the is_filled method to return the correct value based on the fillstyle.

5. Corrected code for the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
Corrected code for the is_filled method:
```python
def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```
With these corrections, the _recache function now correctly sets the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle, and the is_filled method returns the correct value. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the failing test pass.
