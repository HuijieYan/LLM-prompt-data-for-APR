2. Potential error location: The error likely lies in the _recache function, specifically in the setting of _filled to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter being passed in.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function (_recache) sets _filled to True unconditionally.
   (b). The failing test (test_marker_fillstyle) checks if the marker style is not filled, but due to the _recache function setting _filled to True, the test fails.
   (c). The failing test error message indicates that the is_filled method is returning True when it should not, leading to the assertion error.
   (d). The GitHub issue confirms that the fillstyle parameter is not working as expected when trying to create a hollow marker.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the _recache function to consider the fillstyle parameter and set _filled accordingly.
   (b). Update the is_filled method to correctly reflect the fillstyle parameter.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Updated to check fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to consider the fillstyle parameter when setting _filled, and ensuring that the is_filled method reflects this change, the bug should be fixed. This correction would allow the failing test to pass, and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding hollow markers not working as expected.
