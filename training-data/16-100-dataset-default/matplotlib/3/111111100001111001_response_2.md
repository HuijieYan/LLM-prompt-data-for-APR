Potential error location: The _filled variable is being set to True before the _marker_function is called. This means that the _marker_function may not be able to modify the _filled variable, leading to incorrect behavior.

Bug cause: The _filled variable is being set to True before the _marker_function is called, which may not be the intended behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Set the _filled variable after calling the _marker_function to ensure that it can be modified correctly.
2. Ensure that the _marker_function is updating the _filled variable if necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
    self._filled = True
```
