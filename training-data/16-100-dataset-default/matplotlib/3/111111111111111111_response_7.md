The issue is related to the `is_filled` method not returning the expected result when `fillstyle` is set to "none" for a marker. This is because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` value.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is "none", then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none' # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method will return the correct result based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to markers not being hollow when setting `fillstyle` to "none".
