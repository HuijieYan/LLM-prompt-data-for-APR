1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. It appears to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object and then calls the `_marker_function` if it is not None. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to validate the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the `_recache` method, specifically the resetting of attributes and the call to `_marker_function`.

3. (a) The buggy function `_recache` is resetting attributes and calling `_marker_function` without checking if it is a valid function.
   (b) The `MarkerStyle` class might have attributes that are not initialized correctly in the `_recache` method, leading to incorrect behavior.
   (c) The failing test is calling the `is_filled` method on `MarkerStyle` and getting an unexpected result, leading to an assertion error.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
   - Ensuring that attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class are initialized correctly within the `_recache` method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None and that it is callable before invoking it. This should prevent any unexpected behavior or errors related to the `_marker_function`.
