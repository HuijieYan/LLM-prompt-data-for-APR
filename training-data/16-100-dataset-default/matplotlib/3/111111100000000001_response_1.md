1. The _recache function is a method of the MarkerStyle class. It is responsible for reinitializing some attributes when the marker function is not None. However, the problem seems to be with the line self._marker_function(), as it is being called without being defined anywhere in the provided code.

2. The potential error location is at self._marker_function().

3. The bug's cause is likely that the _marker_function is not defined anywhere in the provided code, so calling it will result in an error.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to define the _marker_function within the MarkerStyle class before calling it in the _recache function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()

    def _marker_function(self):
        # do something here
        pass
```

In this corrected code, I have added a placeholder for the _marker_function within the MarkerStyle class, and I have also added a condition to check if the _marker_function is not None before calling it in the _recache function. This should prevent any errors related to the undefined _marker_function.
