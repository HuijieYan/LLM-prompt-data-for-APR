1. The buggy function is a method called _recache() within the MarkerStyle class. It seems to be responsible for recaching the marker style settings. The GitHub issue suggests that using fillstyle='none' is not producing the expected result when creating a custom MarkerStyle and using it with ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the line where self._marker_function() is called. This is where the marker function is being called, but it may not be handling the fillstyle parameter correctly.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the _recache() function handles the fillstyle parameter. The _recache() function resets several properties to default values and then calls self._marker_function(), which likely determines the appearance of the marker. The bug may be due to the _marker_function not correctly processing the fillstyle='none' parameter.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the _marker_function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, ensuring that it properly sets the marker to be hollow when fillstyle='none'.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False when fillstyle is 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Setting self._filled to False when fillstyle is 'none' will ensure that the marker is hollow when used with ax.scatter(), satisfying the issue posted on GitHub.
