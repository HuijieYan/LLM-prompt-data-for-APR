The bug in the _recache function is that it sets self._filled to True unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the input value of self._fillstyle. This causes the is_filled method to return True even when the fillstyle is 'none', leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to set self._filled to False when self._fillstyle is 'none'.

Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the _recache function will correctly update the self._filled variable based on the input value of self._fillstyle.

This corrected code will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub, where markers with fillstyle 'none' were not appearing hollow as expected.
