The potential error in the code is that the _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally, regardless of the input value of self._fillstyle. This means that the function is not taking into account the actual input value when setting the _filled variable.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to check the value of self._fillstyle and then set _filled accordingly. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False, otherwise it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly set the _filled variable based on the value of self._fillstyle, as expected in the test cases.
