The potential error in the problematic function is the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, resulting in a failure when called in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be properly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class. This method should return the value of the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    # The corrected is_filled method
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

```

With the `is_filled` method correctly implemented, the failing test should pass.
