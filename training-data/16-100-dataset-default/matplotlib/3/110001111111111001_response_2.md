Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue lies in the `_filled` variable, which is being set to `False` instead of `True` when the `_recache` function is being called.

Bug's cause:
The `_filled` variable is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the expected value in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `True` instead of `False`.
2. Ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `_filled` variable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Updated to set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now set the `_filled` variable to `True`, which will resolve the issue in the failing test.
