The bug in the function lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. It is currently being set to `False` regardless of the input `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the failing test because `is_filled` method checks for the value of `_filled` and expects it to be `True` when the fillstyle is not 'none'.

To fix the bug, you need to update the function such that it sets `_filled` to `True` when the fillstyle is not 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
