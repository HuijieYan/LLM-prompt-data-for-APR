The bug in the function is that the _filled variable is being set to False regardless of the input value. This is the cause of the discrepancy in the expected and actual input/output variable value.

To fix this, we need to set the _filled variable based on the input parameter self._fillstyle.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set the _filled variable based on the value of self._fillstyle, as expected.
