1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is responsible for resetting various attributes when the marker function is called.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the direct call to self._marker_function() without checking if it exists. This could lead to a potential AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

3. Here's the cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to call the _marker_function attribute without checking if it exists, which can lead to an AttributeError.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class does not provide any mechanism to define or set the _marker_function attribute, so its presence is not guaranteed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a validation to check if the _marker_function attribute exists before calling it.
   - Provide a method for setting the _marker_function attribute within the MarkerStyle class.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # add a validation to check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
With the added validation, the corrected function will only call _marker_function if it exists, preventing any potential AttributeError.
