The issue with the buggy function is that it sets `_filled` to True unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return True even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` variable should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', `_filled` should be set to False. Otherwise, it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
