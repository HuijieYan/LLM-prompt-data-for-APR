The _recache function is not properly setting the marker_function which is causing the failing test to assert not True for marker_style.is_filled(). This is because the _marker_function is not being properly assigned.

The potential error location within the _recache function is the line self._marker_function(). Since the marker_function is not being properly assigned, calling it here is causing the issue.

The bug is caused by not properly assigning the marker_function within the _recache function, leading to a failure in the marker_style.is_filled() method.

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the marker_function within the _recache function. This can be done by setting self._marker_function to a valid function that correctly updates the marker properties.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if marker_function is a valid function
        self._marker_function()  # Call marker_function to update marker properties
```

With this correction, the _recache function will only call self._marker_function if it is a valid function, and it will update the marker properties accordingly. This will ensure that the failing test for marker_style.is_filled() passes.
