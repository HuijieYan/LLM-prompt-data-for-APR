1. The buggy function is responsible for recaching the marker style. It checks if the marker function is None and then resets the marker style attributes and calls the marker function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists.

3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `self._marker_function` always exists. If `self._marker_function` is None, then calling it will result in an AttributeError. This could happen if the marker function is not set before calling `_recache`.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it. Additionally, it may be a good idea to add a setter method for `self._marker_function` to ensure it is always properly set.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None
        # other init code
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
