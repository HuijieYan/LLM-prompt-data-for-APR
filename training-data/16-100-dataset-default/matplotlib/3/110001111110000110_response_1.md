# The fixed version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change from True to False to make the markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

The fix involves changing the value of `_filled` to `False` in order to make the markers hollow.

With this fix, the failing test function should pass and the issue described on GitHub should be resolved.
