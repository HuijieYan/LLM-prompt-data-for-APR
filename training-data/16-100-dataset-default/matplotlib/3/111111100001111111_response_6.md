The issue is with the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The expected value for `_filled` is `True` but the actual value is `False`, which is causing the markers to not be hollow as expected.

To fix this, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` if the `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, and to `True` otherwise.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
