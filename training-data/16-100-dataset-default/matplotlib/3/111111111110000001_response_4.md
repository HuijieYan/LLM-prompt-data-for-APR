The issue with the buggy function `_recache` is that it attempts to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call a function that may not have been defined.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before trying to call it. If it does not exist, we should return from the function. Additionally, based on the failing test, we also need to provide an implementation for the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function and the `is_filled` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # Other class methods...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the condition to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it and implementing the `is_filled` method to return the value of `_filled`, the corrected code should now pass the failing test.
