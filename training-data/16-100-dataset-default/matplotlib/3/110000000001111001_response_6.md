The potential error in the provided code is that the function is incorrectly setting the `_filled` variable to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`. This causes a discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values, leading to a failing test case.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` instead of `False` as it is expected to have that value.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now sets the `_filled` variable to the expected value of `True`, satisfying the provided expected input/output variable information.
