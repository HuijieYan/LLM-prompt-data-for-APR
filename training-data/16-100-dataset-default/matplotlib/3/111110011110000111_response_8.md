1. The buggy function is _recache() from the MarkerStyle class. The failing test is trying to create a MarkerStyle object with fillstyle set to 'none' and then check if it is filled or not. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is not returning the expected value. The GitHub issue also mentions that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers when used with ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the lines where the fillstyle is being set, as this is the part that seems to be causing the issue.

3. (a). The buggy function: The _recache() function sets various attributes of the MarkerStyle object, including the fillstyle.
   (b). The buggy class: The MarkerStyle class contains the _recache() function as well as other methods and attributes related to marker styles.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test is trying to create a MarkerStyle object with fillstyle set to 'none' and then check if it is filled or not. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is not returning the expected value.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue mentions that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers when used with ax.scatter().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the code where the fillstyle is being set and ensure that it is correctly handling the 'none' value.
   - Check if there are any other attributes or methods that could be affecting the fillstyle behavior and fix them accordingly.
   - Ensure that the is_filled() method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._fillstyle = None  # Set fillstyle to None initially
        if self._marker_function.__name__ == "_set_tickdown":
            self._fillstyle = 'full'  # Set fillstyle to 'full' for specific marker function
        elif self._marker_function.__name__ == "_set_tickup":
            self._fillstyle = 'full'  # Set fillstyle to 'full' for specific marker function
        elif self._marker_function.__name__ == "_set_tickleft":
            self._fillstyle = 'full'  # Set fillstyle to 'full' for specific marker function
        elif self._marker_function.__name__ == "_set_tickright":
            self._fillstyle = 'full'  # Set fillstyle to 'full' for specific marker function
        else:
            self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Set fillstyle to 'none' for all other cases
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code sets the fillstyle attribute based on the marker function, and it also properly updates the filled attribute. This should address the issue with the fillstyle not working as expected and ensure that the failing test passes.
