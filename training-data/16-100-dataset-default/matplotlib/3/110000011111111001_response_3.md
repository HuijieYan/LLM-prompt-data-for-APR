The issue with the buggy function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, which is incorrect. It should set `self._filled` to `False` if the fillstyle is 'none', and to `True` otherwise.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled to True if fillstyle is not 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now set `self._filled` to `True` when the `fillstyle` is not 'none', and will remain as `False` when `fillstyle` is 'none', as expected. This will correct the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
