The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. The `self._marker_function()` is not being called, and this may be necessary for updating other attributes as well.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects that `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. However, the buggy function is not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` input.

The GitHub issue also states that the user is trying to set markers to be hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'` but is not getting the expected result. This aligns with the failing test and the potential bug in the function.

To fix the bug, the function should check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, the `_marker_function` should be called to ensure that any other necessary updates are made.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` input, and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it should address the issue reported on GitHub.
