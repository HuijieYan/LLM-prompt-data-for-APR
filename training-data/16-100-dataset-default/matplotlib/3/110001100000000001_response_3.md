1. The buggy function _recache is responsible for resetting various properties of a marker. It also calls the _marker_function, which is presumably responsible for updating the marker's appearance.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be with the call to self._marker_function(). If self._marker_function is not properly defined or is not callable, this could cause an error.

3. The bug's cause could be that self._marker_function is not defined or is not callable. This could result in a "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" when trying to execute self._marker_function().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Check if self._marker_function is defined and callable before attempting to execute it.
   (b) If self._marker_function is not defined or callable, handle it gracefully and avoid calling it.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None and is also callable before attempting to execute it. This prevents the "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" error from occurring.
