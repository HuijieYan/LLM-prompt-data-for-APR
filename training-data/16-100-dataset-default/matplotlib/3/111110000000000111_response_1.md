1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the class `MarkerStyle` which seems to be related to the GitHub issue about markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()`. The issue describes an attempt to use a custom `MarkerStyle` with the parameter `fillstyle='none'` but not getting the desired result.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This contradicts the intent of the GitHub issue, which aims to create hollow markers.

3. (a). The buggy function `_recache` unconditionally sets the attribute `_filled` to `True`.
   (b). The class `MarkerStyle` seems to be used to customize markers, and the issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers.
   (c). The GitHub issue describes a code snippet where the user creates a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` but does not achieve hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the value of `fillstyle` and conditionally setting the `_filled` attribute based on that, or adding a new attribute specifically for controlling the filled state of the marker.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Check if fillstyle is 'none' and set _filled accordingly
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the fillstyle and conditionally setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected code should now result in the desired behavior where setting `fillstyle='none'` creates hollow markers as expected.
