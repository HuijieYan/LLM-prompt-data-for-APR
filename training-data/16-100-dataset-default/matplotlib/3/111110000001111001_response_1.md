The potential error in the problematic function is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` unconditionally, instead of being set based on the value of `self._marker_function`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_filled` assignment to be conditional based on the value returned from `self._marker_function`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Conditional assignment based on the return value of self._marker_function
        self._filled = self._marker_function() or True
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the return value of `self._marker_function`, as per the expected input/output variable information provided.
