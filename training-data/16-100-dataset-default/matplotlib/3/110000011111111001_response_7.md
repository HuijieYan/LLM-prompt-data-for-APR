The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is setting `_filled` to `False` instead of setting it to `True` as expected in Case 1.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `True`, but since `_filled` is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, the test is failing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `True` as expected in Case 1.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Updated to set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```
