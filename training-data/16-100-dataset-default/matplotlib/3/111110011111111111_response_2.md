The bug is caused by the `filled` attribute not being set to the correct value in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. This causes the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail in the `test_marker_fillstyle` test.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `self._filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, and set it to `True` otherwise.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `test_marker_fillstyle` test should pass, and the markers should behave as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` object and setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'.

Additionally, the GitHub issue reporting that the markers are not hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` should also be resolved with this fix.
