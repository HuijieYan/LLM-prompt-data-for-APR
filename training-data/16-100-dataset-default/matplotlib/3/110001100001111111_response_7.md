The buggy function is supposed to recache the marker style, but it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This is causing the markers to not appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is in the `_recache` function. When the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`, but currently it is always set to `True`, resulting in the markers not appearing hollow.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, and if it is anything else, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter, which should resolve the issue when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the markers' `fillstyle` to 'none'.
