1. The buggy function `_recache` is being called when setting marker styles in the matplotlib library. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` attempts to create a MarkerStyle object with `fillstyle='none'`, but the `is_filled()` method returns `True` instead of `False`. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function `_recache` initializes the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which is the cause of the `is_filled()` method always returning `True`.
   (b). The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` expects the `is_filled()` method to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it returns `True`.
   (c). The GitHub issue also describes the same problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Changing the initialization of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
   - Ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the marker style will work as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This solution addresses the issue described in the GitHub report as well.
