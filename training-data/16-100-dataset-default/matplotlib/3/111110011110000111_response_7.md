1. The buggy function is _recache() within the MarkerStyle class. The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle() creates a MarkerStyle object with fillstyle set to 'none', and then checks whether the marker is filled or not. The error message indicates that the assertion for marker_style.is_filled() fails. The GitHub issue also describes the same problem when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where _marker_function() is called. This function is not properly checking the fillstyle parameter and is leading to markers not being rendered as hollow when it should.

3. (a). The buggy function is setting different properties of the MarkerStyle object, but it's not properly handling the fillstyle parameter, which is resulting in the markers not being hollow.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is responsible for defining the style of markers, including the fillstyle parameter, which is not functioning as expected.
   (c). The failing test and error message indicate that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker is still being considered filled.
   (d). The GitHub issue describes the same problem where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of _marker_function to ensure it properly handles the fillstyle parameter and sets the markers as hollow when fillstyle is 'none'.
   - Verify the implementation of the get_fillstyle() and is_filled() methods in the MarkerStyle class to ensure they return the correct values based on the fillstyle parameter.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled property based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.path.get_fillstyle()  # Assuming path has the fillstyle information
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With the corrected code, the _recache() function properly updates the filled property based on the fillstyle, and the get_fillstyle() and is_filled() methods also use the fillstyle to determine if the marker is filled or not. This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
