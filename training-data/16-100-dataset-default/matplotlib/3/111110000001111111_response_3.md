The issue appears to be with the handling of the `fillstyle` parameter and its effect on the `_filled` variable within the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. 

The cause of the bug is that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the expected behavior is for the markers to be hollow, but the actual behavior is that the markers are still filled. This discrepancy is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `_filled` variable within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. 

The corrected version of the `_recache` function should look like this:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` variable accordingly. This should resolve the issue where setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

The corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
