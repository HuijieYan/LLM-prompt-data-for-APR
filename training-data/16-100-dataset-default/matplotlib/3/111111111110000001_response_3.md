Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `_marker_function()` without first checking if it exists. This could be causing the test to fail when trying to determine if the marker is filled or not.

Bug's Cause:
The `_recache` function is not checking if `_marker_function` exists before calling it, which is causing the failing test to throw an error when trying to determine if the marker is filled or not.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it.
2. If it does not exist, handle it appropriately to prevent the failing test from throwing an error.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `_marker_function` is callable before calling it. This ensures that if `_marker_function` is not defined or is `None`, it won't be called, preventing the failing test from throwing an error. This should now make the function pass the failing test.
