1. The buggy function, _recache, is a method of the MarkerStyle class. It seems to be responsible for resetting various attributes to default values, and then calling the _marker_function method. The failing test is checking the behavior of the MarkerStyle class when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The error message indicates that the is_filled method of the MarkerStyle class is returning True instead of False.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function appears to be the line where the _filled attribute is being set to True. This is likely causing the is_filled method to return True, even when the 'fillstyle' attribute is set to 'none'.

3. (a). The _recache function is resetting various attributes, including _filled, to default values without taking into account the fillstyle attribute.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is using the _recache function to reset its attributes when needed.
   (c). The failing test is checking the behavior of the MarkerStyle class when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The error message indicates that the is_filled method is returning the incorrect value.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to take into account the fillstyle attribute and set the _filled attribute accordingly.
   - Modify the is_filled method to consider the fillstyle attribute when determining if the marker is filled.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected code, the _recache function now takes into account the fillstyle attribute and sets the _filled attribute accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
