1. The buggy function is a part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. It is used to recache the marker style, where the recaching process involves setting several attributes of the MarkerStyle class. The GitHub issue reported that when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems like there should be a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

3. The buggy function is trying to recache the marker style, but it is not handling the scenario where `_marker_function` is not defined, which could be the cause of the issue reported in the GitHub post. This issue is causing the marker not to be hollow even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The GitHub post explicitly mentions that the custom MarkerStyle is not working as expected when attempting to create hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the recache function.
   - Investigate the usage of the fillstyle parameter and how it interacts with the recaching process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check to ensure _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Handle the case where _marker_function is not defined
            pass
```

By adding a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it, this corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub post, where the MarkerStyle's fillstyle parameter was not working as expected.
