The buggy function is _recache, which is a method of a class that needs to be fixed. The function is intended to update certain internal attributes and then call a marker function if it exists. However, the issue is that the _filled attribute is being set to True unconditionally, which is incorrect. This causes the failing test because the MarkerStyle.is_filled() method is expecting the _filled attribute to be False, but it's being set to True regardless of the input parameters.

The input value for self._fillstyle in both cases is 'none', which determines that the markers should be hollow. However, the function unconditionally sets self._filled to True, which causes the markers to be filled instead of being hollow.

To fix the bug, the _filled attribute should be set based on the value of self._fillstyle. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False. Otherwise, it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and when using the MarkerStyle object with fillstyle='none', the markers will be hollow as expected. This will also successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
