Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the _recache function in the MarkerStyle class. At the end of the function, the _filled variable is incorrectly being set to True, rather than False as expected.

Bug's cause:
The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but the _recache function is setting the _filled variable to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter. This discrepancy between the expected and actual _filled value is causing the test to fail. Additionally, the GitHub issue indicates that setting fillstyle to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the _recache function should correctly set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter. Additionally, the MarkerStyle class may need to be updated to handle the fillstyle parameter correctly to achieve the desired behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():




    # Corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled variable is set based on the fillstyle parameter, which should align with the expected behavior. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
