The potential error location: The _recache function is not setting self._filled correctly and should be adjusted to ensure it reflects the expected value.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function: The _recache function is not setting self._filled correctly.
(b). The buggy class: MarkerStyle sets the properties for marker style but is not properly updating the fill status.
(c). The related functions: get_fillstyle and is_filled functions are used to retrieve and check the fill status respectively.
(d). The failing test and error message: The failing test is checking the is_filled value and is failing due to incorrect value setting by the recache function.
(e). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value: The expected value for self._filled is True, but the value is being set to False.
(f). The GitHub Issue information: The issue is that the marker style is not being set to hollow when using fillstyle='none'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _recache function to correctly set the self._filled value to True when fillstyle is 'none'.
2. Ensure that the is_filled function returns the correct value based on the fillstyle.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the _filled property based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the marker should be displayed as hollow when using fillstyle='none' in the provided example.
