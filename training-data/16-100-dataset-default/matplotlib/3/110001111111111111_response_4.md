The issue is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the value of `self._fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_recache` function now considers the value of `self._fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute, which will resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
