1. The buggy function is the _recache function inside the MarkerStyle class. The function is supposed to update the MarkerStyle based on user-provided parameters. The GitHub issue mentions that setting the fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected. This indicates that the bug is likely within the _recache function where the fillstyle is not being handled correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the setting of the _filled attribute to True in the _recache function. This contradicts the expected behavior when fillstyle is set to 'none' as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The _recache function might not be correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class might not be correctly updating its attributes based on the user-provided parameters.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that setting fillstyle='none' does not produce hollow markers as expected, indicating a discrepancy in the handling of fillstyle.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and modify the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle setting.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to check the fillstyle parameter and modify the _filled attribute accordingly, the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should be resolved.
