The potential error in the function `_recache` is that it is trying to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it's actually defined. This can lead to a `NameError` if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # This is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This prevents the potential `NameError` that could occur if `_marker_function` is not defined.
