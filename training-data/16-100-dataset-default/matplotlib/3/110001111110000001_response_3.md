The potential error in the problematic function `_recache` is that it is trying to call a method `_marker_function` without checking if it exists, which can lead to an `AttributeError`. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to raise an AssertionError when trying to call `marker_style.is_filled()`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

This corrected code should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` without raising an AssertionError.
