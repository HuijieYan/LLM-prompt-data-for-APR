1. The buggy function _recache() is not directly related to the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue revolves around the inability to create hollow markers using markers.MarkerStyle() and setting the fillstyle to 'none' when using ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the marker function.

3. (a). The buggy function _recache() sets certain attributes and then calls the _marker_function. This function is not provided in the given code, so it's unclear what it does.

   (b). The GitHub issue states that the user wants to create hollow markers using markers.MarkerStyle() and setting the fillstyle to 'none', but is not getting the desired result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the _marker_function being called within _recache() to ensure it is working as intended.
   - Use the correct parameters or method to create hollow markers with markers.MarkerStyle().
   - Check for any additional code that may be conflicting with the desired marker style.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# the corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set markers as not filled to create hollow markers
    self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function
```

With this corrected version, the _recache() function sets the markers to not filled, which aligns with the user's request to create hollow markers. This change should help resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
