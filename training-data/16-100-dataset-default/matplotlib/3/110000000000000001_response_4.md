1. The buggy function is designed to reset certain attributes and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.

2. The potential error location is the last line of the function where it calls `_marker_function` without checking if it actually exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the function doesn't check if `_marker_function` exists before attempting to call it. This can cause a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not set.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding a check to ensure `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, and providing a default behavior if it is not set.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
