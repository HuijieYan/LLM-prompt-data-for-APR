1. The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset various attributes of an object and then call the `_marker_function`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks whether it is filled or not. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function could be the line `self._filled = True`. This suggests that the `is_filled()` method might be checking the value of `_filled` and returning the opposite.

3. The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally, which is contradictory to the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle` object. This discrepancy is indicated by the failing test and the error message from the test. The GitHub issue also reflects the same problem when the user is trying to create hollow markers but not getting the expected result.

4. To fix the bug, we can change the logic within the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `self._filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, the GitHub issue could be addressed by showing the correct usage of creating hollow markers using `ax.scatter()` and `MarkerStyle`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function that should resolve the issue and pass the failing test:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now checks the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass. Additionally, the GitHub issue can be resolved by providing the correct usage of creating hollow markers.
