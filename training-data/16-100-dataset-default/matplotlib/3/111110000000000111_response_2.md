1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is responsible for setting various properties for markers. The GitHub issue is related to the usage of MarkerStyle and setting markers to be hollow, but the fillstyle parameter does not seem to be working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of self._filled to True, which should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none'.

3. (a). The buggy function is setting self._filled to True unconditionally, which means that even when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will still be filled.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is not correctly handling the case when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the value of fillstyle and appropriately setting the _filled attribute to True or False based on the fillstyle value.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks the value of fillstyle and sets the _filled attribute accordingly, fixing the bug where markers are not appearing as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none' as per the GitHub issue.
