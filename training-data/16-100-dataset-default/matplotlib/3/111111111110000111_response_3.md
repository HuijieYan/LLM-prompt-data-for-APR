1. The buggy function is the _recache function within the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file. It is related to the failing test function test_marker_fillstyle in the test_marker.py file. The error message indicates that the is_filled method is not returning the expected result. The GitHub issue also reflects the same problem, where the user is unable to create hollow markers using fillstyle='none'.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function is the line "self._marker_function()". This line is likely causing the issue as it is attempting to call a marker function that may not exist, leading to unexpected behavior.

3. The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect implementation of the _recache method, specifically the call to _marker_function. The failing test is trying to create a MarkerStyle with a hollow fillstyle, but the is_filled method is returning True instead of False, indicating that the marker is filled. The GitHub issue also reflects this, where the user is unable to create hollow markers using fillstyle='none'.

4. To fix the bug, the _recache function should be modified to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the is_filled method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle.

5. Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
        else:
            self._filled = True
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
