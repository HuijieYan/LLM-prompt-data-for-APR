1. The buggy function is a method within the MarkerStyle class. It is meant to recache marker properties, but it has several issues such as using undefined variables and calling a non-existent function.

2. The potential error is that the _marker_function is being called without being defined anywhere in the class.

3. The cause of the bug is that there is no _marker_function defined in the class, so calling it will result in an error.

4. To fix the bug, the _marker_function should either be defined in the class or removed from the _recache method if it is not necessary.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected recache method
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```
