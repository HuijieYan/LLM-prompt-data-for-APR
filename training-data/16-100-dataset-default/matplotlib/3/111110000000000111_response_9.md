# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it is responsible for resetting various properties of the marker style. The GitHub issue reports a problem with setting markers to be hollow (`fillstyle='none'`) using a custom `MarkerStyle` and `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location is identified in the line `self._filled = True`, which sets the markers to be filled. This contradicts the intention of the GitHub issue to have hollow markers.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `_recache` function sets `_filled` to `True`, which causes markers to be filled.
   (b). The `MarkerStyle` class is not setting the `_filled` property to `False` for making hollow markers.
   (c). The GitHub issue reports incorrect usage of `fillstyle='none'` to make markers hollow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property to `False` to make markers hollow.
   (b). Verify the usage of `fillstyle` when creating a custom `MarkerStyle`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
        self._marker_function()
```
By setting `_filled` to `False` in the `_recache` function, the corrected code ensures that custom `MarkerStyle` objects will create hollow markers when used in conjunction with `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
