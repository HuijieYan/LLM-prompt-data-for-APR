Potential error location: The _filled variable is being set to True regardless of the input value of self._fillstyle.

Bug's Cause:
The _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally, which is incorrect. It should depend on the input value of self._fillstyle.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a conditional statement to check the value of self._fillstyle and set _filled accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function handles different possible values of self._fillstyle and sets _filled based on those values.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # checking the value of self._fillstyle
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
