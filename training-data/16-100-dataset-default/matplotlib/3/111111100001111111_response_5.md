The issue is that when the fillstyle is set to 'none' in MarkerStyle, the markers are not hollow as expected. This is indicated by the GitHub issue and the expected output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the marker to be filled regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `fillstyle`. This leads to the markers being filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the markers will be correctly set as hollow when `fillstyle` is 'none', satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
