The bug in the function is that it is not setting the value of `self._filled` to `True` as expected. Instead, it is always setting it to `False`. This is the cause of the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `self._filled` is set to `True` at the end of the function.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
