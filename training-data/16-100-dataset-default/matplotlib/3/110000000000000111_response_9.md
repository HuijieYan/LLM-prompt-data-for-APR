1. The buggy function is a method called _recache and it seems to be a part of a class in a larger codebase. It's not directly related to the GitHub issue, but it is a possible place where the issue could be stemming from, especially given that the issue is related to markers and their fillstyle.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line self._marker_function(). It seems to be calling a marker function, but it's not clear what this function does or how it relates to the rest of the function.

3. The bug's cause could be that the _marker_function is not being called correctly which might be related to the markers not behaving as expected in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the function sets a number of attributes to default values, but it's unclear why this would be related to markers not behaving as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the implementation of self._marker_function to ensure it is being called correctly and addressing any issues in that code. Additionally, further investigation may be needed to determine if the attributes being set to default values in the function are related to the issue in the GitHub post.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, I have added a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it. This could prevent any issues related to an incorrect or missing marker function call.
