The issue with the buggy function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, which causes the failing test to fail. This is because the `get_fillstyle` method is returning the correct result, but the `is_filled` method is not, due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `False` instead of `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` in the `_recache` function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on the fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.
