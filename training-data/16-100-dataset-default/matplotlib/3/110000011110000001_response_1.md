1. The buggy function seems to be setting various attributes and then calling a marker function. The failing test is checking for the `is_filled` method of a MarkerStyle object, which seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute being set in the buggy function. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning True when it should be False.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_filled` attribute being set to True unconditionally.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is set to True in the `_recache` function, which causes the `is_filled` method to return True even if `fillstyle` is set to 'none' in the MarkerStyle object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to take into account the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute.
   - Instead of unconditionally setting `_filled` to True, it should be set to False if the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
By including the `fillstyle` attribute check in the `_recache` function and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
