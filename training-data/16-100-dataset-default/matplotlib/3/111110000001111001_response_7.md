The issue in the buggy function is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` only if it was previously `False`. Instead, it should always be set to `True`. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the conditions and always set `_filled` to `True` at the end of the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will always set `_filled` to `True`, regardless of its previous value, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
