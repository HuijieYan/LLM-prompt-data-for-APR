1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. This function is responsible for recaching certain attributes when they are not None. It sets several attributes to default values and then calls the _marker_function.

2. The potential error in this function is that it attempts to call self._marker_function without first checking if it is None or exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function attempts to call self._marker_function without first checking if it is defined or not. This can lead to an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

Now, with the added check to see if self._marker_function is not None before calling it, the bug should be resolved.
