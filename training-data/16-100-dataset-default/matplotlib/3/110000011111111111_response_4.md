The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. The expected value of `self._filled` is `True` in the failing test, but the actual value is `False`, causing the test to fail.

The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of `self._filled` to `False` in the `_recache` function. This contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which should result in the marker being hollow (unfilled).

To fix the bug, `self._filled` should be set to `False` only if `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` as expected, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, this change will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report, where the user expected the markers to be hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.
