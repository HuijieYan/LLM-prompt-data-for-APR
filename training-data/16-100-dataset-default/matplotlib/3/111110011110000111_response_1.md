1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is filled or not after setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none', but it is failing. The GitHub issue is also related to the same problem, where the user is not able to create hollow markers using `ax.scatter()` and `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', as indicated in the failing test and the user's issue description.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not properly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, as well as the user's issue description stating that they are unable to create hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Checking the value of `fillstyle` and setting `_filled` based on that value.
   (b). Ensuring that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' results in `_filled` being set to `False`.
   (c). Updating the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
By making the above changes to the `_recache` function, the bug should be fixed. Now, when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow, and the failing test should pass. This correction will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not appearing hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'.
