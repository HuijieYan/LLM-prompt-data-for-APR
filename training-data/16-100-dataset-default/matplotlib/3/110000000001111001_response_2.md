The problematic function is trying to recache several attributes based on a condition, and then invoke a marker function. The bug is likely in the code block that sets the attribute _filled to True unconditionally. This is causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to set the attribute _filled based on the value of self._fillstyle. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False, otherwise, it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
