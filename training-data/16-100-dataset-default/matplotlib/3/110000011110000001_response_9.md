The error occurs when the `is_filled()` method from the `MarkerStyle` class is called, and it returns `True` when it should return `False` according to the test. This indicates that the `_recache` function, particularly the line `self._filled = True`, is causing the issue. The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` provided during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` provided during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object, which should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
