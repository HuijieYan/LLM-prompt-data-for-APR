1. The buggy function appears to be a method within a class, as it is referencing `self`. It seems to be a function to reset certain attributes of the class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to call `self._marker_function()`. This function seems to be intended to call another function, but it is not implemented correctly.

3. The bug may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the `_marker_function`, which is likely intended to perform some specific marker-related functionality for the class. This function might not be defined or might not be defined correctly, causing the program to encounter an error when trying to call it.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Check if the `_marker_function` is defined and implemented correctly within the class. If not, define it or correct its implementation.
   - If the `_marker_function` is meant to be a callback to a function defined outside the class, make sure it is defined and accessible at the time `_recache` is called.
   - Ensure that any necessary arguments are passed to `_marker_function`, if it requires any.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
