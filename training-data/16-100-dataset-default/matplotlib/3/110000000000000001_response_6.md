1. The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset several attributes and then call the `_marker_function`. The issue seems to be with the call to `_marker_function` without checking if it exists.

2. The potential error is the call to `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not check if `_marker_function` exists before attempting to call it. This can lead to a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Add a check to see if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.
   b. Provide a default function to call if `_marker_function` is `None`.
   c. Raise an error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This will prevent a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not defined.
