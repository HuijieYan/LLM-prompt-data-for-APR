The bug appears to be in the _recache function, where the _filled attribute is not being set correctly. This is causing the test_marker_fillstyle test to fail because the is_filled method is returning the incorrect value.

The root cause seems to be that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is not being updated accordingly, which is causing the is_filled method to return False when it should be True.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the value of self._fillstyle in the _recache function. The content of the _recache function should be updated as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the _recache function should now correctly update the _filled attribute based on the value of self._fillstyle, and the failing test should pass.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved.
