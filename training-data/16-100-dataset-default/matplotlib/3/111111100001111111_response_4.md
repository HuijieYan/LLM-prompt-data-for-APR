The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue is related to the `self._filled` variable, which is being set to `False` unconditionally, regardless of the input value of `fillstyle`.

The GitHub issue indicates that when using `fillstyle='none'` with `ax.scatter()`, the markers are not hollow as expected. This is directly related to the bug in the `_recache` function where the `self._filled` variable is not being set correctly.

To fix this bug, the conditional setting of `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter needs to be added in the `_recache` function. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `self._filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`. This will ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers will be hollow as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Default to True
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Conditional setting based on fillstyle
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `self._filled` variable will be set appropriately based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This will ensure that when `fillstyle` is 'none', the markers will be hollow, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
