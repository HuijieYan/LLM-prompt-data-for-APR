The issue seems to be with the implementation of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking whether the marker is filled or not, but due to the incorrect implementation of `_recache`, the fillstyle is not being applied correctly, leading to the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

The bug seems to be in the line where the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is set to `True` instead of `False`, despite setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This discrepancy in the expected and actual input/output variable value is causing the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.

This correction should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers are not being rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
