1. The buggy function _recache(self) is a method within the markers.MarkerStyle class in the file lib/matplotlib/markers.py. This function seems to be responsible for updating the marker properties. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow using fillstyle='none' and not getting the expected result when using ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(), as there is no assignment of any function to self._marker_function, and it seems to be called without any check.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _recache(self) does not handle the fillstyle='none' setting, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.
   (b). The related functions, including markers.MarkerStyle and ax.scatter(), are using the fillstyle parameter to control whether the marker is filled or hollow.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates the usage of markers.MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none' when using ax.scatter(), but the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache(self) function to appropriately handle the fillstyle property and ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow when fillstyle='none' is set.
   - Assign a suitable function to self._marker_function that updates the marker properties based on the fillstyle setting.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache(self) function to consider the fillstyle property and set the filled property accordingly, the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved.
