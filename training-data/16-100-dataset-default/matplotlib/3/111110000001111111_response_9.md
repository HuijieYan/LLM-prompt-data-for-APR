The issue is that the MarkerStyle class does not correctly handle the fillstyle parameter. The expected behavior is that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers should be hollow, but the actual behavior is that the markers are still filled.

The potential error location is the _recache function, where the _filled attribute is incorrectly set to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

The bug is caused by the _filled attribute not being updated based on the fillstyle parameter, resulting in the markers being filled when they should be hollow.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False to make the markers hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the MarkerStyle class should correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, and the markers should be hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'.
