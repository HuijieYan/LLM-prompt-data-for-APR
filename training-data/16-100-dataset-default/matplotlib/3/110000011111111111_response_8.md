The bug in the function is caused by setting self._filled to False instead of the expected True. This is contradictory to the expected behavior where setting fillstyle to 'none' should result in hollow markers, which means self._filled should be True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to set self._filled to True when fillstyle is 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly update the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter, allowing the markers to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This fix should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
