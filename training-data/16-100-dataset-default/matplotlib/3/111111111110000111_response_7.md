1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to recalculate the marker's properties. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the `test_marker.py` file is checking if the marker style is filled or not. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result.

The GitHub issue suggests that setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none' does not produce the expected hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the incorrect implementation of the `_marker_function`, which is intended to recalculate the marker properties.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class does not correctly update the filled status of the marker when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.
   (b). The related class and functions do not handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly, leading to incorrect marker filling.
   (c). The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method does not return the expected result. This suggests that the marker properties are not being updated correctly.
   (d). The failing test error message confirms that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
   (e). The GitHub issue further supports the observation that the `fillstyle` parameter is not producing the expected hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the filled status of the marker.
   - Ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly takes into account the `fillstyle` parameter when recalculating marker properties.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = self.get_path()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled status based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `_recache` function now updates the filled status of the marker based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also make the failing test pass.
