The bug is located in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The bug is causing the markers to not be hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` variable should be set to `False`. However, the function is setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code will ensure that the `_filled` variable is set based on the value of `fillstyle`. As a result, when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers will be hollow as expected. This fixes the issue reported on GitHub.
