The issue seems to be with the `_filled` variable, which is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should return `True` based on the `fillstyle` value.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will be set based on the `fillstyle` value, and it should return the expected value for the `is_filled` method.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
