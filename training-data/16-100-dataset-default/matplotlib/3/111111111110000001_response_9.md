1. The buggy function is called `_recache` and it is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The function sets various attributes of `MarkerStyle`, including `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, etc., and then calls the `_marker_function`. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` and is failing with the error message `AssertionError: assert not True`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `_marker_function`.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to recache the marker style attributes and then call `_marker_function`, but it seems there may be an issue with the way `_marker_function` is being called.
   (b) The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method along with other methods and attributes.
   (c) The related functions have not been provided.
   (d) The failing test is trying to check the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` and is failing with the error message `AssertionError: assert not True`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check how `_marker_function` is being assigned or called within the `MarkerStyle` class.
   b. Ensure that the `_marker_function` is actually setting the correct attributes for `_filled`, which is being checked in the failing test.
   c. Debug the `is_filled` method to verify its behavior.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function `_recache` is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By making the above correction, the failing test should pass since it ensures that `_marker_function` is called only if it exists.
