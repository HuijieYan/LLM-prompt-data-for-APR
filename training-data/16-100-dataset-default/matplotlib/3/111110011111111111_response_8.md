The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line is setting the `_filled` variable to True unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to incorrectly return True, leading to the failing test.

The root cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is being set to True unconditionally, even when `self._fillstyle` is 'none'.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle` before setting it to True unconditionally.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub should also be resolved, as the markers will now correctly appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
