The buggy function is the `_recache` function, which is used to reset certain variables and call the `_marker_function` under certain conditions. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks whether the marker style is filled, and it fails with the error message `assert not True`. Based on the expected input/output variable information, the `_filled` variable should have been set to `True` after calling the `_recache` function. However, in the buggy implementation, the `_filled` variable is being set to `False`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. Here, the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally, which is not aligned with the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` only if the `_marker_function` is not `None`. This change will ensure that the `_filled` variable is set correctly based on the condition of the `_marker_function`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._marker_function is not None else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_filled` variable will be set to `True` if the `_marker_function` is not `None`, which aligns with the expected behavior and will cause the failing test to pass.
