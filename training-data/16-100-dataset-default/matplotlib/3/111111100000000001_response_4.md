The potential error in the buggy function is the call to self._marker_function() without checking if it exists or has been assigned. This could potentially cause an AttributeError if _marker_function has not been defined.

To fix the bug, we should check if self._marker_function exists before calling it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```
