The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is designed to re-cache the marker properties. The issue with the function is that when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute is not being updated to `False` as expected, resulting in the markers not being hollow when used with `ax.scatter()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if self._marker_function is None`, which should be checking if the fillstyle is set to 'none' and then updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is not being updated in the `_recache` method when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'. This discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is the root cause of the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method needs to be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_recache` method will properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This will ensure that when using `ax.scatter()` with a `MarkerStyle` object and setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.

This fix also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post, where the user was unable to get hollow markers using `ax.scatter()` with a customized `MarkerStyle` object.
