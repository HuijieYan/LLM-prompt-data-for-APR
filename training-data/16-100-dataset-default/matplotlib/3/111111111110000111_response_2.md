1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module. It is responsible for updating the attributes of the marker style. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a specific marker and fillstyle and then checks if the fillstyle is set correctly and if the marker is hollow. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` is not returning the expected result.

The GitHub issue is reporting that setting the fillstyle to 'none' when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` does not result in a hollow marker as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is attempting to call a method stored in the attribute `_marker_function`, but it is not checking if `_marker_function` is set to a valid method before calling it.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` is not being checked for existence before calling it. This is resulting in unexpected behavior in the `is_filled` method and causing the marker not to be hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
   - Ensure that the correct method is assigned to `_marker_function` during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.
   - Update the `_marker_function` to correctly handle the fillstyle and adjust the marker appearance.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` is checked for existence before calling it, ensuring that any unexpected behavior related to its absence is mitigated. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the failing test to pass.
