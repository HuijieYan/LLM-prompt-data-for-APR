1. The buggy function _recache does not take any arguments and appears to be a method of a class, as it tries to access self. It seems to be a part of the class related to markers in the matplotlib library.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(), where it tries to call a method without checking if it exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the function tries to call self._marker_function without checking if it is defined, which can lead to an AttributeError. This function is meant to reset certain attributes to their default values, but it should not call another method without proper validation. This can cause the program to crash if _marker_function is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, the function should check if self._marker_function exists and is callable before attempting to call it. If it is not defined, the function should handle it gracefully or raise an appropriate error.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that self._marker_function exists and is callable before attempting to call it. If it is not defined or not callable, the function will not be called, preventing any AttributeError.
