1. The buggy function is a part of the matplotlib library and is responsible for recaching marker properties. It sets various properties to their default values and then calls the marker function to update the marker.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it attempts to call the _marker_function without checking if it exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is calling _marker_function without first ensuring that it has been defined. This could lead to a potential AttributeError if _marker_function has not been set.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that _marker_function is not None before attempting to call it. Additionally, we can also add a default implementation for _marker_function to prevent AttributeError.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```
