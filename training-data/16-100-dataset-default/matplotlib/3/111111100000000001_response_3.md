The potential error in the `_recache` function is that the `self._marker_function` is called without checking if it exists, which could lead to an AttributeError if it is not defined in the class. The function also seems to reset some attributes unconditionally, which may not be the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. Additionally, we should only reset the attributes if they are not already set.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path if self._path is None else self._path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform() if self._transform is None else self._transform
            self._alt_path = None if self._alt_path is None else self._alt_path
            self._alt_transform = None if self._alt_transform is None else self._alt_transform
            self._snap_threshold = None if self._snap_threshold is None else self._snap_threshold
            self._joinstyle = 'round' if self._joinstyle is None else self._joinstyle
            self._capstyle = 'butt' if self._capstyle is None else self._capstyle
            self._filled = True if self._filled is None else self._filled
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it. Then we use conditional statements to set the attributes only if they are not already set. This ensures that the attributes are not reset unnecessarily.
