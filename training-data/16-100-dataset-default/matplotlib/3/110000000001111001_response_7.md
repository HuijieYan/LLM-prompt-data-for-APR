Potential error location: The bug is caused by setting self._filled to True instead of False in the _recache function, which is in conflict with the expected output.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug: Change the value to expected in the _recache function by setting self._filled to True.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
