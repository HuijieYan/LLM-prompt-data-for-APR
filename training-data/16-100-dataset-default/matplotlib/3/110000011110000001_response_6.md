The problematic function _recache() is a method of an undefined class, but it appears to set a number of attributes and then call a method _marker_function().

The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle() is trying to create a MarkerStyle object with marker='o' and fillstyle='none', and then check if the fillstyle is indeed 'none' and if the marker is filled or not. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True instead of False.

The potential error location within the _recache() function is the line:
self._filled = True

This line is setting _filled to True unconditionally, which is likely causing the is_filled() method to return True regardless of the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, the line setting _filled should be modified to reflect the actual fillstyle being used.

Here's the corrected version of the _recache() function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding an additional condition to set _filled based on the fillstyle, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
