1. The buggy function `_recache()` is supposed to reset various attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function()`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` is testing if setting `fillstyle='none'` actually makes the marker hollow, but it's failing. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. The GitHub issue is also related to this problem, as the user wants to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'` but is not getting the desired result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter, which causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation in the `_recache()` method, which does not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. The failing test is trying to create a marker with `fillstyle='none'` and then check if it's hollow, but it fails because the marker is always filled. The GitHub issue also confirms this problem, as the user expects hollow markers when setting `fillstyle='none'` but is not getting the desired result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Inspect and modify the `_recache()` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
   - Update the implementation of the `is_filled()` method to properly check the `fillstyle` parameter and return the correct result.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache()` method:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
With this corrected implementation, the `fillstyle` parameter will now appropriately determine whether the markers are filled or hollow, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved, as setting `fillstyle='none'` will now result in hollow markers as expected.
