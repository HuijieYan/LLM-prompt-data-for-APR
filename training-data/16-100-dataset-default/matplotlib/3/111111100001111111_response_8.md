1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is intended to update certain attributes of MarkerStyle when the _marker_function is not None. The GitHub issue describes a situation where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers, indicating a potential bug with the _recache function.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the line where _filled is being set to True unconditionally, regardless of the value of self._fillstyle. This means that even if fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will still be filled.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the fact that the _recache function unconditionally sets _filled to True, which overrides any attempts to set fillstyle to 'none' in the MarkerStyle class. This discrepancy between the expected behavior (hollow markers) and actual behavior (filled markers) is consistent with the GitHub issue description.

4. To fix the bug, the _recache function needs to check the value of self._fillstyle and set self._filled accordingly. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled should be set to False to achieve the desired hollow markers.

5. Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
This corrected function checks the value of self._fillstyle and sets self._filled accordingly. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled is set to False, allowing for hollow markers when the MarkerStyle class is used.
