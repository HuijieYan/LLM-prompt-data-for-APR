Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be caused by the `_filled` variable not being set to False when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none' in the MarkerStyle class.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly setting the `_filled` variable to False when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none', resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a condition to check if `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and then set the `_filled` variable to False accordingly.
2. Update the logic in the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable based on its value.

Corrected Code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the MarkerStyle class will now properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` variable based on its value. This will resolve the issue of markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
