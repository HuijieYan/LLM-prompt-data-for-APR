Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error is in the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` line of the failing test. This indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the expected result.

Bug's cause:
The `is_filled()` method is not implemented correctly in the `MarkerStyle` class or it is not returning the expected result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly determine if the marker is filled or not.
2. Modify the `_recache()` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
