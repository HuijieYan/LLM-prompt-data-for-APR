1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class. It is intended to be a method that reinitializes certain attributes of the class when called.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to self._marker_function(), assuming that this function is supposed to exist and be callable.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be that the _marker_function is being called without checking if it exists, which could lead to a runtime error if it is not defined.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to ensure that _marker_function exists and is callable before calling it.
   - Initialize _marker_function to be None in the class constructor if it is meant to be optional.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, the _marker_function is initialized to None in the class constructor, and a check for its existence and callable status is added before calling it in the _recache method.
