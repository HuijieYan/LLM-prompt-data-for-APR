The issue is related to setting the markers as hollow using fillstyle='none' and it is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
self._filled = True

The bug's cause is that when setting fillstyle='none', the expected behavior is to have hollow markers, but the code is setting _filled to True regardless of the fillstyle.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the fillstyle parameter and update the _filled variable accordingly.
2. Ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow when fillstyle='none' is specified.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated code checks the fillstyle parameter and sets the _filled variable accordingly. This should resolve the issue of markers not rendering as hollow when fillstyle='none' is specified.
