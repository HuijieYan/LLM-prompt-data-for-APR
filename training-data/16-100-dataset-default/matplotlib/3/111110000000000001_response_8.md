# The potential error in the _recache function is that it is trying to call a function without checking if it exists first, which can lead to a AttributeError if the function does not exist.

# Fixing the bug:
# To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the _marker_function exists before calling it.

# The corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```
