Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to reset a set of variables and then call a marker function. However, there is a mistake in the function as it's not properly resetting the _filled variable to True. This seems to be causing the issue described in the GitHub post, where the markers are not being displayed as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the failure to correctly reset the _filled variable to True, resulting in the markers not appearing as hollow as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a line to set self._filled = True at the end of the _recache function to ensure that markers are filled by default.
2. Verify that the marker function is correctly handling the _filled variable when drawing the markers.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled variable to True at the end of the _recache function, the markers should now appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This correction should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
