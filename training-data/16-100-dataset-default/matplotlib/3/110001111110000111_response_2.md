The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_marker_function` being called without being defined. This could be the cause of the failing test and the issue posted in GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` needs to be defined and should be responsible for setting the marker as filled or hollow according to the `fillstyle` parameter.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to create a new function, `_set_marker_fill`, which checks the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the marker as filled or hollow accordingly. This function will then be called in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # New function to set marker fillstyle
    self._set_marker_fill()
    
def _set_marker_fill(self):
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue posted in GitHub should also be resolved.
