1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. It is responsible for updating the markers when changes occur.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` which is causing the issue as it should be a callable function that updates the marker, but it is being called without being defined.

3. The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` not being defined, leading to unexpected behavior when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle` class. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user is unable to achieve hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Defining the `_marker_function` properly within the `MarkerStyle` class to handle changes in the marker style.
   - Ensuring that the `fillstyle` parameter is properly handled within the `_recache` function to achieve hollow markers when specified.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            # Update marker to be hollow
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks for the `fillstyle` parameter and updates the `_filled` attribute accordingly, allowing the user to achieve hollow markers when setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
