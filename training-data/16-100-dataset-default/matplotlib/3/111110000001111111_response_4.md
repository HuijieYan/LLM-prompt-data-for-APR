The issue is likely occurring in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. When the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` in order to ensure the marker is hollow as expected. However, in the current implementation, the `_filled` variable is not being updated, resulting in markers not being hollow as intended.

To fix this, we should update the `_filled` variable to `True` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated code ensures that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` variable is also set to `True`, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
