The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. It appears that there is a missing implementation for the `is_filled` method, which causes the failing test to throw an assertion error.

The potential error location within the `_recache` method is the setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` without checking the actual fill style.

The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` method is not properly considering the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute, which leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method needs to take into account the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute, which will resolve the issue with the failing test.
