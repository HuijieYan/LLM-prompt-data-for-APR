The issue is that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are still filled rather than being hollow as expected. This behavior is inconsistent with the fillstyle parameter's purpose.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the _recache() method, where the function is setting self._filled to True unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle value.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache() method is not correctly checking the fillstyle value to determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _recache() method to check the fillstyle value and set the _filled variable accordingly. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks the fillstyle value and sets the _filled variable accordingly. When the fillstyle is 'none', _filled is set to False, ensuring that the marker is hollow as expected.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub, as the markers will now behave as expected when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
