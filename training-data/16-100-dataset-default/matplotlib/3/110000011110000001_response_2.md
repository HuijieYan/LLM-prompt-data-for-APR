The problematic function seems to be a part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib` library. The function is responsible for resetting certain attributes and then calling the `_marker_function`, which seems to be a key part of the `MarkerStyle` class.

The failing test is trying to verify that `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. However, it is failing with an error suggesting that `marker_style.is_filled()` is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This suggests that the `is_filled` method might be based on the value of `self._filled`, which is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` instead of unconditionally setting it to `True`. Additionally, we should ensure that the `self._marker_function` is actually defined to avoid any potential errors related to that.

Here's the updated and corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should now return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the failing test should pass.
