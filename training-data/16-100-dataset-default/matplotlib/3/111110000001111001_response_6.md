The problem with the `_recache` function is that it does not properly set the value of `_filled` based on the condition of `self._marker_function` being `None`. The expected and actual input/output variable information show that the expected value of `_filled` is `True`, but the actual value is `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to set the value of `_filled` to `True` when `self._marker_function` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True when self._marker_function is not None
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will properly set the value of `_filled` based on the condition of `self._marker_function` being `None`, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
