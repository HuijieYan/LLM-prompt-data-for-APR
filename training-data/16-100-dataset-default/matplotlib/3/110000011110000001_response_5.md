1. The buggy function is called _recache and it is a method of a class (self is used). It is trying to reset several attributes and then call the _marker_function method. The failing test is related to the MarkerStyle class which has a method is_filled that returns True if the marker is filled.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that calls self._marker_function(). There seems to be a discrepancy in the way the _marker_function is being called.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _recache is supposed to reset several attributes and then call the _marker_function method. However, it seems that the _marker_function is not being called correctly, leading to the failure in the test case.
   (b). The failing test is testing the is_filled method of the MarkerStyle class, but the bug in the _recache function might be causing the marker to not be filled as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the _marker_function is being called correctly within the _recache method.
   (b). Verify that the attributes being reset in the _recache method are being reset properly and not causing any undesirable effects on the MarkerStyle class.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # check if _marker_function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()  # call _marker_function only if it is not None
```

With the corrected code, the _recache method now checks if the _marker_function is not None before calling it. This should address the potential issue identified in the buggy function.
