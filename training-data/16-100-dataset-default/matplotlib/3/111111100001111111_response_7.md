1. The buggy function is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The function `_recache` is responsible for updating certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue reported on GitHub is that when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is likely causing the markers to not appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`, which overrides the intention of setting `fillstyle` to `'none'. This causes the markers to appear filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The GitHub issue provides an example of how this bug can be reproduced using the `ax.scatter` function with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the value of `self._fillstyle` and only set `_filled` to `True` if `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`.
   - Adjust the logic to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that the markers appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        # Check if fillstyle is 'none' and set _filled accordingly
        if self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle.lower() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

The corrected code includes a conditional check to set `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, ensuring that the markers appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the bug.
