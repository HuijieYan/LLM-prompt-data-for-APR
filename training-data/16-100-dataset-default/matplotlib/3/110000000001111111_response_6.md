The issue here is that when setting the fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected. This suggests that the _filled attribute is not being properly updated to False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```
self._filled = True
```
This line should be updated to:
```
self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
```
This change will correctly update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle value.

The bug's cause is that the _filled attribute is being set to True unconditionally, regardless of the value of the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction to the _recache function, the _filled attribute will be correctly set based on the fillstyle value, and the markers should appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub, where the markers are not appearing hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
