The bug in the given function is that the _filled variable is not being set to True as expected. This is a result of the condition `if self._marker_function is None` only returning None, which does not evaluate to False in a boolean context. 

To fix this, we need to explicitly check if `self._marker_function is None` using an if statement. If it is not None, then we should set the _filled variable to True.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the _filled variable will be set to True when the _marker_function is not None, which satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
