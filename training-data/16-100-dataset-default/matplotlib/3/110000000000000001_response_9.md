The potential error in the given function is that it tries to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not.

The bug's cause is that it does not have a check for existence of `_marker_function` before calling it. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` does not exist.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
