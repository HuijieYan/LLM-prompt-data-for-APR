1. The buggy function is a part of the MarkerStyle class in the matplotlib library. It seems to be responsible for updating the properties of a MarkerStyle object. The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not, and it is failing with an assertion error. The GitHub issue indicates that when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the conditional check for self._marker_function being None. If this check passes, the function returns without updating any properties, which might be causing the issue.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using:
   (a). The buggy function: The _recache function is not correctly updating the MarkerStyle properties when called, resulting in unexpected behavior.
   (b). The buggy class: The MarkerStyle class might not be handling the fillstyle properly, leading to the markers not appearing as expected.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test is checking the is_filled() method of the MarkerStyle and it is failing, indicating that the marker is not appearing as not filled as expected.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue states that the markers are not appearing as hollow when setting fillstyle to 'none', which aligns with the failing test result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the properties of the MarkerStyle object are correctly updated when _recache is called.
   - Check if the fillstyle parameter is being handled correctly in the MarkerStyle class.
   - Debug the behavior of the MarkerStyle class when setting fillstyle to 'none' and look for any discrepancies.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With this corrected code, the _recache function will update the properties of the MarkerStyle object, and the is_filled function will correctly check if the marker is filled. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
