The potential error location in the buggy function is the `_filled` attribute. It is set to `True`, which contradicts the expectation in the failing test and the GitHub issue that requires the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function of the MarkerStyle class. This causes the markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. This can be done using an if-else condition to check the `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

The corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the MarkerStyle class. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and also pass the failing test for the `is_filled` method.
