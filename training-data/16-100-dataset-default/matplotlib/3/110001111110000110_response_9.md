```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# this is the fixed function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check for marker function existence
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make the marker hollow
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Call the marker function if it exists
            self._marker_function()
```

The issue was that the function was not correctly checking for the existence of the marker function and the filled parameter was not being set to False to make the marker hollow. The `_recache` function has been fixed to address these issues.

The failing test and the GitHub issue can be resolved with this fix.
