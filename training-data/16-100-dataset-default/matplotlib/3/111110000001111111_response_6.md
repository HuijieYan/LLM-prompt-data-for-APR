The issue here seems to be that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are still being filled in. The `_recache` function is supposed to update the marker style attributes, but it seems that it's not setting `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is 'none'.

To fix this, we can add a condition to check if `fillstyle` is 'none' and then set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the marker style should be updated correctly and the markers should now appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

As for the GitHub issue, the title could be: "Hollow markers are not displayed when using ax.scatter() with markers.MarkerStyle() and setting fillstyle to 'none'."

The description should include the provided code for reproduction and the fact that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected. After implementing the suggested fix, the issue should be resolved.
