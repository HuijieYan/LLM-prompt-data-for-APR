The issue with the buggy function in this case is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` instead of `True`, but the expected value at the function's return is `True`. This is causing the failing test, as the `is_filled()` method is returning `False` due to the incorrect value of `_filled`.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `True` instead of `False` in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Changed from False to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now set the `_filled` attribute to `True` as expected, and the failing test should pass.
