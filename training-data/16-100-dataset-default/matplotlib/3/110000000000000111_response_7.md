1. The buggy function _recache() is within the Matplotlib library and it is called when a marker function is called. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow, but the fillstyle parameter does not seem to be working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it calls self._marker_function().

3. The bug is caused by the _recache() function resetting all marker properties to their default values, which overrides any customizations made to markers. This is evident from the fact that the GitHub issue also shows that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not have the desired effect.

4. In order to fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the _recache() function to not reset marker properties if they have been customized. Another approach could be to allow users to set marker properties without them being reset by the _recache() function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._path == _empty_path:
        self._path = None
    if self._transform == IdentityTransform():
        self._transform = None
    if self._alt_path is None:
        self._alt_path = None
    if self._alt_transform is None:
        self._alt_transform = None
    if self._snap_threshold is None:
        self._snap_threshold = None
    if self._joinstyle == 'round':
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
    if self._capstyle == 'butt':
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With these changes, the _recache() function will not reset marker properties to their default values if they have been customized. This should allow users to set markers to be hollow using the fillstyle parameter as intended.
