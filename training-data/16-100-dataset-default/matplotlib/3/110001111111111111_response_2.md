The bug in the `_recache` function is that it's setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, instead of based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the marker style.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking that `not marker_style.is_filled()` is True, which means `marker_style.is_filled()` should be False. However, the `_filled` attribute is unconditionally set to True in the `_recache` function, which is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to conditionally set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the marker style.

The correct code for the `_recache` function is:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
  
    if self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
        
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.

After applying the fix, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should no longer occur.
