The bug in this function is that it does not handle the case where both input values, vmin and vmax, are 0 or very close to zero. In this case, the function should return -expander and expander. This case is not currently handled, leading to incorrect output for this scenario.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for this specific case and return the appropriate values. We should check if both vmin and vmax are very small and then return -expander and expander if this is the case.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case where both input values are very small, and returns the correct values as expected for all the given test cases.
