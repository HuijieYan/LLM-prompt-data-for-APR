The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero correctly. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not account for this scenario, causing incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for this scenario. We can modify the last `elif` condition to check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero and then adjust them accordingly. Additionally, we can simplify the checks for infinities by removing the unnecessary `expander` value for those cases.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if (abs(vmin) <= tiny) and (abs(vmax) <= tiny):
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
