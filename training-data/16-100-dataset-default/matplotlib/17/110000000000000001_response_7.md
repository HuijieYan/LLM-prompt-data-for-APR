1. The buggy function takes in the minimum and maximum values of a range and modifies them to avoid singularities. However, there are potential errors in the logic of the function, specifically with the conditions for expanding the range and swapping endpoints.

2. The potential error locations are the conditions for expanding the range based on the interval size and the conditions for swapping the endpoints.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditions for expanding the interval and swapping the endpoints are not correctly implemented. This can lead to incorrect adjustments of the range endpoints.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the conditions for expanding the range and swapping the endpoints are properly implemented.
   - Checking for edge cases such as when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
   - Handling cases where the inputs are inf or NaN.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            if increasing:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
            else:
                vmax -= expander*abs(vmax)
                vmin += expander*abs(vmin)

    return vmin, vmax
```
