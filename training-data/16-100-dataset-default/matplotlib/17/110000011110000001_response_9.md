The buggy function in question is `nonsingular`, which is being used in the `test_colorbar_int` function. The error message indicates that there are 'RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered' in the `nonsingular` function. 

The issue is likely occurring in the following block of code:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
    vmin = -expander
    vmax = expander
```

The `RuntimeWarning` is being triggered by an overflow encountered when taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. 

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the absolute value is within the limits of the data type being used to prevent overflow. We can achieve this by checking for the absolute values being too large before attempting to take the `max` and `abs` of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if abs(vmin) > 1e6 or abs(vmax) > 1e6:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should fix the overflow issue and allow it to pass the failing test without encountering any `RuntimeWarning`.
