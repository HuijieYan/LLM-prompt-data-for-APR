The buggy function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range in order to avoid singularities. However, there are several issues present in the function that cause it to not behave as expected.

The main issue lies in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. The function currently calculates `maxabsvalue` using the `max` function, which does not handle negative values correctly. Additionally, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not properly handle cases where both `vmax` and `vmin` are negative.

To fix these issues, the calculation of `maxabsvalue` should be updated to take the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` should be adjusted to check for the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Updating the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to use `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`.
2. Adjusting the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to check for the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
