The function `nonsingular` in the `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py` file is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` from `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_colorbar.py` is showing issues related to overflow and warning messages encountered during the function execution.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function seems to be the conditional block associated with the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. The calculation `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` might lead to an overflow issue due to large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, which in turn causes the runtime warning about overflow.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to handle the overflow issue and the subsequent warning by refactoring the logic for calculating `maxabsvalue`. This can be achieved by updating the calculation logic in the `nonsingular` function to avoid the potential overflow issue. Instead of directly calculating `maxabsvalue` using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`, an alternative approach could be to modify the calculation logic to handle the overflow condition.

Below is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax - vmin < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected version of the `nonsingular` function revises the logic for handling the potential overflow issue by directly checking the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` against the `tiny` threshold to avoid the overflow. This should resolve the overflow and warning issues observed in the failing test.

With this corrected function, it is expected that the failing test `test_colorbar_int` would pass without encountering the overflow warnings.
