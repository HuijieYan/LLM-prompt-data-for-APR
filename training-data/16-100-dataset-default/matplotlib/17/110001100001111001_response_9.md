Upon analyzing the buggy function and the information provided, it seems that the issue lies in the logic for determining when to modify the endpoints of the range to avoid singularities. The function is not handling the cases where vmin and vmax are very close to each other, or when they are equal, properly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to properly handle these edge cases. Specifically, when the interval is very small or when vmin and vmax are equal, the function should expand the interval as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin == vmax or np.isclose(vmin, vmax, atol=tiny):
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
        return vmin, vmax

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected function now properly handles the edge cases where the vmin and vmax are very close to each other or equal, and it satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
