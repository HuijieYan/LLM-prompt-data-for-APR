The buggy function appears to be designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing test is related to overflowing int16 datatype when used with the function in question. The error messages indicate "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute", suggesting that there is an overflow issue with the current implementation of the function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified where arithmetic operations are being performed without explicitly handling potential overflow errors, resulting in the RuntimeWarnings.

To fix the bug, it is essential to handle potential overflow situations when performing arithmetic operations with integer data types, preprocess the input to convert it into an appropriate format, and ensure that the function can handle different data types without overflowing.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    try:
        diff = vmax - vmin
    except OverflowError:
        return -expander, expander
