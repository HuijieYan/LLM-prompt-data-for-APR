1. The buggy function `nonsingular` is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in the initial endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, and some optional parameters. The function also checks for finiteness of the inputs and swaps the endpoints if `vmin` is greater than `vmax`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. This condition checks if the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than a certain threshold and then modifies the endpoints accordingly.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the condition mentioned above. If the inputs fall within a specific range, the modification of the endpoints may not be accurate, leading to potential issues in handling singularities.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Revising the condition for modifying the endpoints to ensure their accuracy.
   - Ensuring that the modifications adhere to the correct logic and accurately handle the range of input values.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
