The issue within the function `nonsingular` is related to the handling of `maxabsvalue` and the comparison of `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`. It is causing overflow issues and incorrect values to be assigned to `vmin` and `vmax`.

The failures are observed in Cases 5, 6, and 7 where the runtime value and type of variables are incorrect compared to the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the comparison of `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny` with regard to potential overflow issues and incorrect type/value assignments.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the code related to the comparison of `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny` to handle potential overflow issues.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval = vmax - vmin

    if interval <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This code handles the comparisons of `vmax - vmin` and `maxabsvalue * tiny` while avoiding potential overflow issues.

With the corrected code, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
