1. The buggy function is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in vmin and vmax as inputs and expands or swaps them as necessary.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditionals that check for singularity and in the operations for expanding or swapping the endpoints.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the conditionals and calculations for expanding or swapping the endpoints may not be approaching the problem correctly, leading to incorrect output and potential errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditional statements to ensure they correctly identify singularities and swap the endpoints if necessary.
   - Revisiting the calculations for expanding the endpoints to ensure they are properly adjusted.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been revised, and the calculations for expanding the endpoints have been adjusted to address the potential bug.
