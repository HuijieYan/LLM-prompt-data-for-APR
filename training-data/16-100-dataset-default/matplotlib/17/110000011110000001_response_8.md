Based on the failing test and the error messages, it seems that the issue lies within the `nonsingular` function's calculations involving `maxabsvalue` and the `elif` condition check. The error messages mention warnings related to overflow and scalar subtraction.

The bug is caused by the `maxabsvalue` calculation, where `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This is subsequently used in the `elif` condition, which can lead to issues when dealing with extremely large/small values, leading to overflow and runtime warnings.

To fix the bug, we can update the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the `elif` condition check in order to avoid overflow and runtime warnings.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the `maxabsvalue` calculation to use conditional statements to determine the maximum absolute value, and modify the `elif` condition to compare the interval directly without relying on the `maxabsvalue` calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Calculate the maximum absolute value conditionally 
    maxabsvalue = abs(vmin) if abs(vmin) > abs(vmax) else abs(vmax)

    # Update the condition to check the interval directly
    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code should address the overflow and warning issues mentioned in the error messages and allow the `nonsingular` function to pass the failing test.
