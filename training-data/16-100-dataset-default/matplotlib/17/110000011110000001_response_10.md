The issue with the `nonsingular` function is that it's not handling the scenario where `vmin` and `vmax` are `int16` type values. This is causing overflow errors when trying to compute absolute values or do calculations with these values.

The potential error location within the function is when it's trying to handle values of `vmin` and `vmax` that are of `int16` type.

The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the function does not account for input values that are of `int16` type, leading to overflow errors when performing calculations or comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input values are properly converted to float type before performing any calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.
    ... (same as before)
    """

    # Convert the input values to float type to avoid overflow errors
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

With this correction, the `nonsingular` function will handle input values of `int16` type correctly and avoid overflow errors, thereby passing the failing test.
