The problematic function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function takes into account the initial endpoints vmin and vmax, along with optional parameters expander, tiny, and increasing. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is part of the `test_colorbar` module, and it uses `nonsingular` via `mtransforms.nonsingular` to produce vmin and vmax values. 

The error messages from the failing test indicate that there are overflow and runtime warning issues in the `nonsingular` function. The overflow is encountered in a scalar subtract operation, and a runtime warning occurs in a scalar absolute operation.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is identified at the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. The current implementation is leading to potential overflow issues due to the absolute value of scalar inputs.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to revise the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, ensuring that the absolute values computation is handled properly to prevent potential overflows or runtime warnings.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we store the absolute values of vmin and vmax in separate variables (`abs_vmin` and `abs_vmax`) before calculating `maxabsvalue`. This approach ensures that the absolute values computation is handled properly, thereby preventing potential overflow issues.

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should pass the failing test.
