1. The given function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in vmin and vmax as the initial endpoints, and has parameters for expander, tiny, and increasing. The function also checks for finite values and swaps vmin and vmax if necessary.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statements that check for singularities and handle the expansion of the interval.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional statements not correctly handling the cases where the interval is too small or the endpoints are zero or close to zero.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would include:
   a. Reviewing and revising the conditional statements to ensure that they accurately handle the cases where the interval is too small or the endpoints are zero or close to zero.
   b. Adding additional checks and alternative calculations for the scenarios where the current conditional statements fail to provide the correct result.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional statements for checking if vmax is less than vmin are modified to handle both increasing and decreasing cases.
- The check for maxabsvalue is updated to compare with the tiny value directly.
- The final swapping of vmin and vmax is done based on the `increasing` parameter to ensure it swaps only when necessary.
