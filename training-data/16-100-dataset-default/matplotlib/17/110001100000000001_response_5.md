Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the calculation of the maxabsvalue and the subsequent condition that compares vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny. The calculation of maxabsvalue and the comparison condition might be causing the function to return incorrect results.

Bug's cause: 
The bug is caused by incorrect comparison logic in the condition to expand the interval. The calculation of maxabsvalue may not accurately represent the maximum absolute value of the endpoints, leading to incorrect expansions of the interval.

Approach for fixing the bug:

1. Calculate the maximum absolute value of the endpoints accurately.
2. Modify the condition for expanding the interval to ensure accurate expansion based on the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue == 0:
        return -expander, expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
The corrected code calculates the maxabsvalue accurately and modifies the condition for expanding the interval based on the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints. Additionally, it also checks if the maxabsvalue is zero and returns the expanded endpoints if it is.
