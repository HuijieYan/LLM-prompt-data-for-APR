The error is occurring due to a numerical overflow in the `nonsingular` function. This is likely happening because the calculations within the function are not accounting for the possibility of very large numbers, such as when the input range is on the order of -32768 to 32768. The function is not handling this edge case properly, leading to the overflow error.

To fix the bug, the `nonsingular` function should be updated to properly handle the edge case of very large input ranges. Specifically, the calculation for `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent conditionals need to be updated to avoid numerical overflow for large input values.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * tiny * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * maxabsvalue
            vmax += expander * maxabsvalue

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected function, the edge cases in the failing tests should be properly handled, and the function should pass the tests without encountering numerical overflow errors.
