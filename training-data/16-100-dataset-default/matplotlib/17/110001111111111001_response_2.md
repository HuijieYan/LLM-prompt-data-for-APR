The bug in the 'nonsingular' function seems to be related to the calculation of the 'maxabsvalue' variable and the condition where 'vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny'. When the difference between 'vmax' and 'vmin' is calculated for large values, it might cause an overflow issue due to the use of integer types. This leads to a RuntimeWarning being raised.

To fix this bug, the 'vmin' and 'vmax' variables should be converted to float data type before performing any operations which might result in an overflow. Additionally, the condition for checking 'vmax - vmin' should be updated to handle large values without causing overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the 'nonsingular' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Convert vmin and vmax to float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    # Updated condition to avoid overflow
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if (vmin, vmax) > (0, 0) and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the above changes, the 'nonsingular' function should now handle large input values without causing overflow errors and pass the failing test cases.
