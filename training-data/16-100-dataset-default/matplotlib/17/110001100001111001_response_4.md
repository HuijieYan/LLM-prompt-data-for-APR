The bug in the function seems to be related to the condition where the interval is smaller than the specified threshold. The condition for this case should check if the absolute difference between vmax and vmin is less than the product of maxabsvalue and tiny.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where the interval is smaller than the specified threshold. It should be changed to:
```python
elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
```

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
