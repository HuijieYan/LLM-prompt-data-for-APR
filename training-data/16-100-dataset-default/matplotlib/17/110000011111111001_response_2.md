The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing tests occur when there is a potential for overflow encountered in scalar operations.

Upon analyzing the failing test and error messages, a potential issue is identified in the `nonsingular` function's logic when it handles large integer values, and there is a risk of overflow in absolute and subtraction operations due to coercing int16 to float without any checks for overflow.

The failing test parameters that trigger this issue involve a tuple `clim` with values (-20000, 20000) and (-32768, 0). The failing tests produce RuntimeWarning for overflow encountered in scalar absolute and in scalar subtract during absolute and subtraction operations, indicating that the function's logic for handling large integer values is flawed.

To fix this issue, it's important to address the potential overflow concerns when dealing with large integer values. Additionally, a specific case where input parameter values are not being correctly handled due to datatype coercion.

The potential fix for this issue could involve performing explicit type checking for input parameters and handling them accordingly. This would involve converting integer input parameters to floats before performing absolute and subtraction operations to avoid potential overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the identified issue:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if isinstance(vmin, (int, np.int16)) or isinstance(vmax, (int, np.int16)):
        vmin = float(vmin)
        vmax = float(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0.0 and vmin == 0.0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function checks for integer input parameters and converts them to float before performing absolute and subtraction operations. This addresses the potential overflow issue when dealing with large integer values.
