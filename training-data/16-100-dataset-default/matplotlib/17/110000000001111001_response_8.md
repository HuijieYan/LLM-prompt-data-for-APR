The potential error location in the problematic function is with the logic used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The issue arises from the conditions used to check if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold, and the calculation of the new endpoints based on this condition. 

The bug's cause can be elucidated by the fact that the modification of the endpoints is not being handled correctly for certain input ranges. For example, in Case 3, the expected values for vmin and vmax are not being correctly calculated, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking if the interval is too small and the subsequent modification of the endpoints need to be revised. The logic should be updated to handle all cases where the endpoints need to be adjusted to avoid singularities.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Check if inputs are finite
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Ensure vmin <= vmax if increasing is True
    if increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    # Calculate maxabsvalue
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # Check if the interval is too small and expand if necessary
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue < 1/twenty_thirds * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            new_vmin = vmin - expander * maxabsvalue / 2
            new_vmax = vmax + expander * maxabsvalue / 2
            if new_vmin == 0 and new_vmax == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin = new_vmin
                vmax = new_vmax

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code should satisfy all the mentioned test cases and the expected input/output variable information provided.
