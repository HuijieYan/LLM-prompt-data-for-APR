The buggy function is `nonsingular` in the `transforms.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. However, there are a couple of issues in the current implementation that lead to runtime warnings and errors in the failing test cases.

1. The function does not handle infinities and finite values properly. It returns the initial values without any modification, which may lead to incorrect behavior when used in further calculations.

2. Conditional checks and operations involving small and large values are not handled optimally, leading to overflow and runtime warnings.

3. The failing test cases indicate that the function does not handle large and small integer values properly and results in runtime warnings related to overflow and scalar arithmetic operations.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:

- Properly handle infinity and finite values by returning appropriate values when one or both inputs are inf or NaN.

- Handle the conditional checks and operations involving small and large values more effectively to avoid overflow and runtime warnings. This can involve better handling of absolute values and comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        if vmax > vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)
    else:
        return vmin, vmax
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle infinite values, small intervals, and large and small integer values more effectively, passing all the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
