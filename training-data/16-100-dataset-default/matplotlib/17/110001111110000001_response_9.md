The buggy function `nonsingular` is meant to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. The function takes in parameters `vmin` and `vmax` representing the initial endpoints, and has optional parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The function performs some calculations and checks to ensure that the endpoints are not singularities and makes adjustments as necessary.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the functionality of the `nonsingular` function by creating a colorbar and checking the results. The error messages indicate that there are RuntimeWarnings related to overflow encountered in scalar operations, and these warnings are coming from the `nonsingular` function in the `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py` file.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` because this calculation is resulting in an overflow encountered in scalar operations.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the potential overflow situation in the `nonsingular` function. One possible approach is to check for potential overflow before performing the calculation of `maxabsvalue`.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    # Check for potential overflow before performing the calculation
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        abs_diff = abs(vmax - vmin)
        if abs_diff <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

With this corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, it should pass the failing test and no longer produce the runtime warnings related to overflow encountered in scalar operations.
