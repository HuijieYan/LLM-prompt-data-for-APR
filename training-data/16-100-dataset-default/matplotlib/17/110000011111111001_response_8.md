This buggy function, `nonsingular`, is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities based on certain conditions and parameters. The function seems to have problems with handling extreme input values leading to overflow errors as indicated in the failing tests and error messages.

The error location appears to be within the `nonsingular` function where comparisons and calculations involving input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are leading to overflow warnings due to large absolute values and differences between the endpoints. This is causing incorrect behavior when dealing with extreme input values or large differences between `vmin` and `vmax`.

The implementation of the `nonsingular` function does not properly handle extreme input values.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Implement an additional check before calculating `maxabsvalue` to ensure it doesn't lead to an overflow. For example, checking if `vmin` and `vmax` are too large before computing the maximum absolute value.
2. Better handle the cases with extreme input values or large differences between `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure that overflow errors are avoided.
3. Adjust the fraction used for expanding `vmin` and `vmax` so that it's based on the actual range of values and not just a fixed tiny value.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if abs(vmax) > 1e6 or abs(vmin) > 1e6:
        # If the absolute value of either endpoint is very large, handle it directly
        new_expander = max(abs(vmax), abs(vmin)) * tiny
        vmin -= new_expander
        vmax += new_expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                new_expander = maxabsvalue * tiny
                vmin -= new_expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += new_expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should handle extreme input values and large differences between `vmin` and `vmax` without leading to overflow errors.
