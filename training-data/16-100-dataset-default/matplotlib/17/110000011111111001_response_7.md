The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by an overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations, resulting in a RuntimeWarning. This is due to the fact that the code tries to compare `vmax - vmin` to `maxabsvalue * tiny`, which can cause an overflow when working with large integers or floating-point numbers.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the overflow issue by using conditional checks to ensure that the operations remain within the limits of the data type being used.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            diff = vmax - vmin
            if np.isclose(diff, 0.0):
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) / diff
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax) / diff

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = sorted([vmin, vmax])

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we handle potential overflow issues by first checking if the difference `vmax - vmin` is very close to zero using `np.isclose`, and then performing the necessary operations accordingly. We also ensure that the result is increasing if `increasing` is set to `False`.

By making these modifications, the corrected `nonsingular` function is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
