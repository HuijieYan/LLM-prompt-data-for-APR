The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the cases where either input is Inf or NaN or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero, as stated in the function's docstring. Additionally, the condition for checking if the interval is smaller than the threshold value is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to add checks for Inf, NaN, and the case where both inputs are very close to zero, and modify the conditions for interval expansion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        vmin, vmax = sorted([vmin, vmax])
    else:
        vmin, vmax = sorted([vmin, vmax], reverse=True)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny or (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            adjustment = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= adjustment
            vmax += adjustment

    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrected function, it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
