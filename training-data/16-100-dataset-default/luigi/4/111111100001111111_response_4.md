The bug in the provided function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` which causes an error when self.columns is None. According to the GitHub issue, the input parameter columns can be None to prohibit table creation, but the code is not handling this scenario properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the code properly handles the scenario where self.columns is None, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the code should now work as expected, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
