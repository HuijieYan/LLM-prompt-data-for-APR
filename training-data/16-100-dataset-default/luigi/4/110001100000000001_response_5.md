Potential Error Location: The bug is caused by the calling of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions without using `self`. This is because the functions are defined with `self` as an argument, implying that they should be called using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused because the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are being called without using `self`, causing them to be treated as standalone functions instead of methods of the class.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions using `self`, as they are defined within the class and should be referenced as class methods.
2. Ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is properly initialized and defined in the class to avoid potential errors.

Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
