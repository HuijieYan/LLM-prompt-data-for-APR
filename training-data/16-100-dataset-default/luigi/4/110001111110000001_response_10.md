1. The `copy` function in `redshift.py` is calling `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions from the same file. The failing test is calling the `run` method of a task called `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` which eventually calls the `copy` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType`. This is likely related to the `columns` attribute in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, as it is being used in the `copy` method without being checked for `None`.
   
2. The potential error location is identified as the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` function.

3. The bug is likely caused because the `columns` attribute is `None`, and the `copy` function does not handle this case properly. This leads to a `TypeError` when checking the length of `None`. The failing test calls `run` on a task with `columns=None`, which then calls the `copy` method on that task, leading to the error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` within the `copy` function. This can be done by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this modification, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This should make the function pass the failing test.
