1. The buggy function 'copy' is failing because it is not handling the case where 'self.columns' is None. This is related to the GitHub issue as it mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with 'columns = None' fails.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line where it checks the length of 'self.columns'. Specifically, the line 'if len(self.columns) > 0:'.

3. (a) The buggy function:
The buggy function is trying to construct a query for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs the query using the table name, column names, source location, credentials, and copy options. The issue arises when the length of 'self.columns' is checked without first ensuring that 'self.columns' is not None.

(b) The GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue details that running Redshift COPY jobs with 'columns = None' fails, resulting in the error "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()". The issue suggests this is due to a specific line in the luigi library, which is causing the problem.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Add a condition to check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to access its length.
- Use a default value for 'colnames' if 'self.columns' is None.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 
In the corrected code, a condition 'if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:' is added to ensure that 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to access its length. This approach resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement.
