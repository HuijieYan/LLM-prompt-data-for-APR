The issue in the code is that it's trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None`. To fix the buggy function, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The change made here is in the line:

`if len(self.columns) > 0:`

to

`if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`

This change checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. This should fix the `TypeError` issue described in the failing test.
