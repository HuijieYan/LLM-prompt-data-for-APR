The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message states "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()", indicating that the `self.columns` is of type None and cannot be used with the `len()` function.

The bug's cause is that the buggy function does not properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None, resulting in the TypeError. This is also confirmed by the failing test, which uses `columns=None` to create the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object.

To fix this bug, the `if` condition should be changed to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change will handle the case when `self.columns` is None and prevent the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before using the `len()` function.
2. Update the class `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` to ensure that `columns` is not None when it is passed to the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and it should pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
