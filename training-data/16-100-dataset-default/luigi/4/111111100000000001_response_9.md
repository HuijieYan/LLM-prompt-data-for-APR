The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`, which are not being called as functions. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions. These functions are not being called properly within the `copy` function, which could lead to improper execution of the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions as methods of the class. Additionally, we should also make sure that the `options` are called properly as a method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # other class methods...

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, `self._credentials()` is called as a method, and `self.copy_options()` is also called properly. This ensures that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are executed as intended within the `copy` method.
