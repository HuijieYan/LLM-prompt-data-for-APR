The bug in the copy function lies in the if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The issue occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a TypeError when trying to check its length.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a DummyS3CopyToTableKey task with `columns=None` and calls the `run` method. Inside the `run` method, the `copy` function is called with the cursor and a file path. However, since `self.columns` is None, the if condition in the copy function raises a TypeError.

The GitHub issue describes the failure of Redshift COPY jobs when `columns` are set to `None` and suggests a potential solution to change the if condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`

To fix the bug, we should update the if condition in the `copy` function to account for the case where `self.columns` is None. Additionally, we should check for the presence of `self.columns` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
