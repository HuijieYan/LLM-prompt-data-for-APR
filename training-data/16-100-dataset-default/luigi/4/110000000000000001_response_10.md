1. The buggy function is a Python function that is supposed to copy data from s3 into redshift. It uses the psycopg2 library to execute a SQL COPY command to achieve this.

2. The potential error location in the function is the `cursor.execute` call. There is a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the `format` method that is supposed to close the `execute` call.

3. The bug is caused by the missing closing parenthesis in the `cursor.execute` call. This results in a syntax error in the SQL query and the function will raise an error when it is executed.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis to properly close the `execute` call.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected code adds a closing parenthesis at the end of the `cursor.execute` call, ensuring that the SQL query is properly formed and will execute without errors.
