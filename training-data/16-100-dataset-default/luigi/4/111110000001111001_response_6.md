The potential error in the buggy function is in the cursor.execute() method call, specifically in the 'options' parameter. The function self.copy_options is not being called and passed as a string in the cursor.execute() method, which causes the error.

The bug's cause is that the self.copy_options method is not being called and concatenated as a string in the cursor.execute() method.

To fix the bug, we need to call the self.copy_options method and concatenate its result as a string in the cursor.execute() method.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the self.copy_options method is called and its result is concatenated as a string in the cursor.execute() method, fulfilling the expected input/output variable information.
