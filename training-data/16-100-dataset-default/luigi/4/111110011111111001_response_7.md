The potential error within the buggy function is in the following lines:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

The error is caused by `self.columns` being `None` in the failing test, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length. 

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking for this condition explicitly.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to process it, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test. This will address the bug and make the function work as expected.
