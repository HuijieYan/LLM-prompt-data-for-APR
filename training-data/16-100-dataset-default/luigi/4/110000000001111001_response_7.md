The potential error in the buggy function is in the way the SQL query is being constructed within the cursor.execute() method. The placeholders for the table, colnames, source, creds, and options are not being populated correctly.

The bug is caused by the missing closing parenthesis within the cursor.execute() method and the incorrect concatenation of colnames.

To fix the bug, the SQL query should be constructed in a way that properly populates the placeholders with the relevant values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.access_key,
        secret_key=self.secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
