The potential error location within the buggy function is in the following lines:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The bug's cause is that when `self.columns` is None, the function tries to call `len(None)` which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

The GitHub issue suggests that the problem occurs when `columns = None` to prohibit table creation. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if statement as suggested in the GitHub issue. We can check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle cases where `self.columns` is None without causing a TypeError. This change also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
