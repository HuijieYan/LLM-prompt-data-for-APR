# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. Added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. Corrected `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()`.
3. Moved the `colnames` variable inside the `if` block to ensure it is only calculated when `self.columns` is not `None`.

These changes should address the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object and the incorrect call to `self.copy_options`.
