The issue in the buggy function is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` functions are not being called properly. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string and not being used in the execute statement.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to call the `_credentials()` and `copy_options()` functions properly, and include the `colnames` variable in the execute statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `self.columns` is not empty. The `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` functions are called with the proper syntax. And the `colnames` variable is included in the execute statement.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected with the provided input/output variable information.
