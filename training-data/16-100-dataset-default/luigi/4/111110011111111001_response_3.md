The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking the length of `self.columns`. The error occurs because `self.columns` is `None` and it's not a list or any other iterable type.

The buggy class is `S3CopyToTable`, and the failing test is in the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` method of the `contrib.redshift_test` class. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is raised due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. Provide a default value for `self.columns` if it's `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This would prevent the `TypeError` raised and the function should now pass the failing test.
