The issue is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This is in line with the failing test's error message stating "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()". The GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as a possible solution.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test. This also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
