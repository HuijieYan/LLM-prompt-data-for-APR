The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` method is not being called to retrieve the options for the copy command. Instead, it is being referenced directly as a method.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` method should be called to retrieve the options.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` method will be called to retrieve the options for the copy command, ensuring that the correct options are included in the executed SQL statement.
