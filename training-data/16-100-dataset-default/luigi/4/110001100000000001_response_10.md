The potential error in the provided buggy function is in the cursor.execute() statement. The _credentials() and copy_options() functions are not being called properly within the string formatting, and there are missing parentheses for the copy_options function.

The bug's cause is that the _credentials() and copy_options() functions need to be called as methods of the class. Additionally, the missing parentheses for the copy_options function need to be added in the cursor.execute() statement.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly call the _credentials() and copy_options() functions as methods of the class and add the missing parentheses for the copy_options function within the cursor.execute() statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
