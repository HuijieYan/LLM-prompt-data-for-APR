Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `copy` function at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` variable is of type `NoneType` and cannot be checked for length.

Bug cause:
(a). The buggy function: The copy function is checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not None.
(b). The buggy class: The DummyS3CopyToTableKey class is initialized with the `columns` parameter set to None, causing the TypeError when the copy function tries to check its length.
(c). The failing test and error message: The failing test creates an instance of the DummyS3CopyToTableKey class with the columns parameter set to None, leading to the TypeError in the copy function.
(d). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value: The copy function expects `self.columns` to be a list, but it is receiving None instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Add a check for None before checking the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.
- Modify the DummyS3CopyToTableKey class to set a default value for the columns parameter, such as an empty list, instead of None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for None before checking the length of `self.columns` to avoid the TypeError. Additionally, we modified the `self.copy_options` call to `self.copy_options()` to ensure that the function is called and its result is included in the SQL query.
