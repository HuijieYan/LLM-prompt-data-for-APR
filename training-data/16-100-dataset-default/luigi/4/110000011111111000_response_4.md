To fix the buggy function, we need to check if the `self.columns` variable is not `None` before attempting to access its `len` property. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to access the `len` of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `NoneType` error encountered in the failing test.
