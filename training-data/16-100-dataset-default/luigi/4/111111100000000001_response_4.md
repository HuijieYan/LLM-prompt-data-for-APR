Potential error location:
The potential error location is the usage of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function. It should be `self.copy_options()`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function as it is missing the parentheses, resulting in the function not being executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function by adding parentheses to it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses to call the function
        )
```
