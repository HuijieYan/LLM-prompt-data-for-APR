The problem is caused by the `self.columns` being `None` and then attempting to check its length. 

To fix this, we can check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and prevent the TypeError that was occurring.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
