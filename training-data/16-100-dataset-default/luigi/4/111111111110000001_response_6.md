The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This line is causing a TypeError because `self.columns` is set to `None` in the failing test, and you cannot call `len()` on a `None` type object.

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is being set to `None` in the failing test, which leads to the TypeError when attempting to get the length of `None` in the `copy` method.

To fix the bug, you should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This can be done using the `is not None` check.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added `self.columns is not None and` before the check for the length of `self.columns` in the if statement. This ensures that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, addressing the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
