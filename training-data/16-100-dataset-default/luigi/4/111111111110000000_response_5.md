The buggy function has a TypeError because it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is None in this case. To fix this, we can use a conditional to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The change made is in the line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` where it checks if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. Additionally, the call to `self.copy_options` has been corrected to `self.copy_options()` with parentheses at the end.
