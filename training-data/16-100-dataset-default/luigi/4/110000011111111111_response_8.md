The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when the `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to check the `len` of `None`.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and calls the `run` method. Inside the `run` method, the `copy` method is called with a cursor and a file path as parameters. Inside the `copy` method, the function tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which leads to the `TypeError` as `self.columns` is `None`.

The GitHub issue provides additional insight into this problem. It suggests modifying the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and not try to get the length of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With these changes, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and not attempt to get the length of `None`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
