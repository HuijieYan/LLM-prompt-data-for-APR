Potential error location:
The potential error is in the cursor.execute() function call, where the SQL query string is not being properly formatted.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incomplete formatting of the SQL query string inside the cursor.execute() function call. The placeholders for table, colnames, source, creds, and options are not being properly replaced with their respective values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use string formatting to correctly replace the placeholders in the SQL query string with their respective values.
2. Handle any potential formatting issues or special characters that may be present in the input values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By using string formatting to construct the SQL query string and then passing it to cursor.execute(), the corrected code ensures that the placeholders are correctly replaced with the respective variable values. This should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
