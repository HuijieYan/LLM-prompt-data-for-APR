Potential error location: The buggy function is failing at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when self.columns is None.

Bug cause:
(a). The buggy function `copy` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test, it is set to `None`.
(b). The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are irrelevant to the bug.
(c). The failing test is trying to run the `copy` function with `self.columns` set to `None`, and it's resulting in a TypeError because `NoneType` has no `len()`.
(d). The input parameter `self.columns` is `None`, but the buggy function expects it to be a list.
(e). The GitHub issue confirms that passing `None` to `self.columns` is causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Change the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the suggested change, the corrected function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None and resolve the TypeError. This will also address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
