The issue in the code is that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, the code tries to iterate over it to create a comma-separated string, which causes a TypeError. 

The GitHub issue also points out that the problem arises when `columns` is set to `None` to prevent table creation, and suggests a possible solution to change the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we should update the `colnames` assignment to only create the comma-separated string if `self.columns` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the code now checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to create the comma-separated string for `colnames`, which resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
