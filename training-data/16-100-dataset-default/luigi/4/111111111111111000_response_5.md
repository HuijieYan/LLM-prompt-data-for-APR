The issue here is that the buggy function is not handling the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`. We can fix this by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Changes:
1. Added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not None before trying to get its length.
2. Invoked `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options` to call the function.

With these changes, the function will now correctly handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test should pass.
