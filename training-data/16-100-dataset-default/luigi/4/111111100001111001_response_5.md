The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect use of the `self.copy_options` attribute. Currently, it is being used as a method, but it should be accessed as an attribute.

The cause of the bug is that in the `cursor.execute` method within the `copy` function, the `self.copy_options` attribute is treated as a method by calling it with parentheses, but it should be accessed as an attribute to get its value.

To fix the bug, we need to access `self.copy_options` as an attribute without calling it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `self.copy_options` attribute will be accessed correctly without calling it as a method. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
