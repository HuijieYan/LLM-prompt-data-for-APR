1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to define the process of copying data from S3 into Redshift. It is related to the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions within the same file, as it calls these functions to retrieve Redshift credentials and copy options. The failing test attempts to test the scenario where the `columns` attribute is set to `None` and encounters a TypeError when attempting to get the length of a `None` type object.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`.

3. (a) The buggy function tries to process the `self.columns` attribute to construct a string of column names to be used in the `COPY` statement.
   (b) The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are called within the `copy` function to retrieve credentials and options for the `COPY` statement.
   (c) The failing test and error message indicate that the `columns` attribute is being set to `None`, causing a TypeError when an attempt is made to get the length of `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. Additionally, the handling of `colnames` needs to be adjusted to accommodate the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
   
5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being not `None` before attempting to get its length. It also calls the `copy_options` function instead of just referencing it, assuming it's a method call, as implied by the usage in the buggy function. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
