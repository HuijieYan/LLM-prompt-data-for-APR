The bug in the provided function is a TypeError occurring when trying to determine the length of the "self.columns" attribute, which is None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The bug's cause is that the function is trying to determine the length of "self.columns" without checking if "self.columns" is not None.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to change the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This will first check if "self.columns" exists and then proceed to check its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
