The issue in the code is that it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`. To fix this, we can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Changes made:
1. Added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
2. Modified `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function.

With these changes, the `copy` function will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the TypeError should be resolved.
