1. The buggy function is a copy function that is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. It uses two other functions, _credentials and copy_options from the same file but not the same class, to get credentials and copy options, respectively.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of self._credentials() and self.copy_options without parentheses, which suggests that these are mistakenly being treated as attributes rather than function calls.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _credentials and copy_options functions should be called with parentheses to execute the function and retrieve the credentials and copy options. However, in the buggy code, they are being referenced without parentheses, suggesting that the code is treating them as attributes.

4. To fix the bug, we need to call the _credentials and copy_options functions properly by adding parentheses to them, so that they are executed and their return values are used in the cursor.execute() statement. Additionally, the self.copy_options reference should be suffixed with parentheses to properly call the function and retrieve the options.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the _credentials function is called using self._credentials() and the copy_options function is called using self.copy_options(). This will properly execute the functions and retrieve the credentials and copy options, fixing the bug in the original code.
