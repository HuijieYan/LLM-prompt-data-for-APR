The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can do this by adding a check for `None` and setting `colnames` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test.
