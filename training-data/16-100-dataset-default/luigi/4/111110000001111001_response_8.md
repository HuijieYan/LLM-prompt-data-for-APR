The potential error in the buggy function is the way the `copy_options` function is being called within the `cursor.execute` method. The `copy_options` function is not being called properly, as it seems to be missing parentheses `()` at the end to actually invoke the function.

The expected behavior of the `copy_options` function is to return a string containing the options for the COPY command. However, in the buggy function, it is not being called as a function but rather used as a variable.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` function should be properly called with parentheses `()` to execute the function and retrieve the options string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Properly calling the copy_options function
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function will now be properly called and its return value will be used as the options string in the `cursor.execute` method.
