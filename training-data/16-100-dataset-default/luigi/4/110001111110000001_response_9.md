1. The buggy function is `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This function is supposed to define the copying from s3 into redshift. The function makes use of the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions from the same file to retrieve credentials and copy options, respectively. The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file, which is testing the situation when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. In this line, the function is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute, and since the `columns` attribute can be `None`, it is causing the `TypeError` when trying to apply the `len` function to it.

3. The bug's cause is that the `copy` function is not handling the case when the `columns` attribute is `None` properly. The `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly related to the bug's cause.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to get its length.
   - If `columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately without trying to get its length.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
