The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This is the line where the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, and it can cause a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.

The bug's cause is due to the fact that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes the `TypeError` when the length of `None` is accessed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This change checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the buggy function should no longer throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
