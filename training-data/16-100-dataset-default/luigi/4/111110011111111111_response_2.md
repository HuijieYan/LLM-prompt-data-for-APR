Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Bug cause:
The buggy function `copy` is checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

The failing test and error message:
The failing test is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns` set to `None`, which results in a `TypeError` due to the buggy code.

Discrepancies:
The input `columns` is of type `None`, but the buggy code is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None.

GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue sheds light on the root cause of the bug, indicating that the code change in a specific pull request resulted in this issue. It suggests a potential solution by changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Update the logic to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
