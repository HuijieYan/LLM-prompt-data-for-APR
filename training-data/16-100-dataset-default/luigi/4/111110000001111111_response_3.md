The issue seems to be related to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`, leading to the TypeError when trying to get the length of `None`. This is in line with the GitHub issue description, which mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails.

The potential error location is in the `copy` function, specifically in the following code block:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```
The issue arises from attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not account for the possibility of `self.columns` being `None`, which leads to the TypeError when trying to get its length. This discrepancy aligns with the information from the GitHub issue, where it is suggested that the code should check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to explicitly check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to get its length. This change will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Additionally, it is important to handle the case where `colnames` is empty, as this would result in an invalid SQL query.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self._access_key,
        secret_key=self._secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options())
        
    cursor.execute(query)
```

In this corrected code:
- We explicitly check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.
- We handle the case where `colnames` is empty by not including it in the SQL query.
- We also call the `copy_options` method to get the options for the `COPY` command.

This corrected code should address the TypeError issue and result in a valid SQL query when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the potential solution mentioned in the GitHub issue.
