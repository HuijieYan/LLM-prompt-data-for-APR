1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift, but it has some issues with calling the related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are being called.

3. The bug is caused by the following:
   (a) The `creds` variable is set to the result of calling the `_credentials` function, which is not correct.
   (b) The `options` variable is set to the `copy_options` function itself, rather than the result of calling the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions correctly to get their return values.
   (b) Use the returned values of `_credentials` and `copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
