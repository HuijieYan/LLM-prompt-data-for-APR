The buggy function in question is the `copy` function from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which then calls the `copy` function. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised because the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, but `self.columns` is `None`.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides additional context, suggesting that the root cause is a recent code change (https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338). The proposed solution is to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can do this by adding a check for None before trying to get the length of the columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and will not try to get its length in that case.

This change should resolve the TypeError when running the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task and satisfy the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.
