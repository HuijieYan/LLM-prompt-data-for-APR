Potential error location: The function call to `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are missing parentheses, and it should be `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by missing parentheses when calling the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions. This causes the functions to not be executed as intended, leading to incorrect behavior of the `copy` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Add parentheses to the function calls for `_credentials` and `copy_options` to ensure they are executed and their return values are used correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
