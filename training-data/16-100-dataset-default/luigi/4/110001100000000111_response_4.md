1. The buggy function 'copy' is designed to copy data from s3 into Redshift. It uses the 'self.columns' attribute to determine if columns need to be specified in the COPY command. The related functions '_credentials' and 'copy_options' are called within the 'copy' function but are not the source of the bug. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug occurs when 'self.columns' is set to None, causing a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line: 
   if len(self.columns) > 0:

3. (a). The buggy function 'copy' is attempting to construct a COPY command in SQL format using string formatting.
   (b). The related functions '_credentials' and 'copy_options' are not directly related to the bug.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides information that when 'self.columns' is set to None to prohibit table creation, a TypeError occurs because the buggy function attempts to use len() on a NoneType object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to use len().
   - If 'self.columns' is None, handle the COPY command differently to accommodate for the absence of column names.
   - Use a default value for 'self.columns' if it is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using len()
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if self.columns is not None:  # Handle COPY command differently if self.columns is None
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
    else:  # Use a default value for self.columns if it is None
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected code checks if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to use len(). It also handles the COPY command differently if 'self.columns' is None and uses a default value for 'self.columns' if it is None. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
