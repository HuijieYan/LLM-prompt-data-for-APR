The bug in the provided code is in the `copy` function where the `options` variable is not being called as a function, causing the COPY statement to be incomplete. The `copy_options` function needs to be called and its return value needs to be included in the `COPY` statement as options.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )

```

This corrected code calls the `copy_options` function and includes its return value in the `COPY` statement. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
