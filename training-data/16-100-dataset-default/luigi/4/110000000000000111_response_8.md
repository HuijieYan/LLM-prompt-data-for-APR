1. The buggy function is a method called copy, which is designed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. The issue on GitHub describes a problem with Redshift COPY jobs failing when columns are not provided, resulting in a TypeError. The GitHub issue identifies the root cause as a change in the code related to handling NoneType for the self.columns attribute in the Luigi library, version 2.7.1.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

3. The bug is caused by the if statement not properly handling the case when self.columns is None. The GitHub issue points out that the code change in the Luigi library may have caused this issue by not handling NoneType correctly, resulting in the TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the if statement to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. Another approach is to modify the code in the Luigi library to handle NoneType for self.columns appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the if statement has been modified to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This change should address the issue described in the GitHub post by handling NoneType for self.columns appropriately.
