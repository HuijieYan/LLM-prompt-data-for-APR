Potential error location:
The issue is with the `cursor.execute` method where the `copy_options` method is not being called correctly.

Bug's cause:
The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` method. There is a missing parentheses to call the method.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method properly within the `cursor.execute` method.

Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)


    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
