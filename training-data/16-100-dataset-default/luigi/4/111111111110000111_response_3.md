The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

The bug's cause is that when checking for the length of self.columns, the code does not account for the possibility of self.columns being None. This causes a TypeError when trying to check the length of None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modify the if statement to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.
2. Use the `or` operator to provide a default value of an empty list in case self.columns is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
