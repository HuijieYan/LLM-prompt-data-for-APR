The issue in the `copy` function is that it is not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is None. We can fix this by checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring when `self.columns` was None.

The rest of the code remains unchanged. After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without any errors.
