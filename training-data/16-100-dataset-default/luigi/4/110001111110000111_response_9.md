The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which causes the bug to occur.

The GitHub issue specifies that the root cause of the bug is in a pull request related to the `copy` function.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the updated `copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change will address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue, and the `copy` function should now work as expected.
