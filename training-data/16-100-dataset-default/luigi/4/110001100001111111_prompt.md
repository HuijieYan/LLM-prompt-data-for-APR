Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _credentials(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def copy_options(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
f, value: `'s3://bucket/key'`, type: `str`

self, value: `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(table=dummy_table, columns=null)`, type: `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`

cursor.execute, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor().execute' id='4605313952'>`, type: `MagicMock`

cursor, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor()' id='4605301616'>`, type: `MagicMock`

self.table, value: `'dummy_table'`, type: `str`

self.copy_options, value: `''`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
colnames, value: `''`, type: `str`






# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
The root cause seems to be https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338

A possible solution would be to change the line to

if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
unless I am missing some reason to explicitly ask only for len(self.columns).
```



1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the related functions, the expected and actual input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The related functions
   (c). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value
   (d). The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
   (b). Successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub
