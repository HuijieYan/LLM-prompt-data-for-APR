The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class where it's checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not `None`.

The bug's cause is that the `copy` function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report about Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided.
