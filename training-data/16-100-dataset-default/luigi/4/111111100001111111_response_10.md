The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The issue stems from the fact that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object, leading to a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get the length of it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate the length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
With this modification, the bug should be fixed and the code should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

By making this modification, the code should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
