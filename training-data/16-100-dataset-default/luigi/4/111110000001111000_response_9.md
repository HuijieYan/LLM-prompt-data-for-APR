```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns: # check if columns list is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()) # calling the copy_options function here
    )
```

By making the following changes, the code should now work as expected:

1. Changed the condition for checking if `self.columns` is not empty inside the if statement.
2. Called the `self.copy_options()` function instead of just `self.copy_options` to execute the function and get its return value.

These fixes should address the issues in the original buggy function and make it work correctly.
