The potential error location in the buggy function is the formatting of the SQL query in the cursor.execute() method. It seems that the query is not formatted correctly and there might be an issue with the placeholders.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the colnames variable is not being properly assigned a value.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the formatting of the SQL query to correctly include the placeholders for the table, colnames, source, creds, and options.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options), (f, self._credentials()))
```
In the corrected code, the placeholders for table, colnames, source, creds, and options are replaced with %s, and the actual values are passed as a second argument to the execute method. This will ensure that the SQL query is formatted correctly and the function will execute as expected.
