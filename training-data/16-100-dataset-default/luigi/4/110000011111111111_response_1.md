The issue in the buggy function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.

In the failing test, the input parameter `columns` of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is set to `None`. When this task is run, it triggers the `copy` function, which then encounters the `TypeError` due to the condition mentioned above.

The GitHub issue also highlights the same problem and suggests a possible solution by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the error.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`, and it will pass the failing test. This solution also aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue.
