1. The buggy function is a part of the luigi library, which is used for building complex pipelines of batch jobs. The function is meant to define copying from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift. The GitHub issue is related to an error that occurs when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prohibit table creation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement that checks the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, then attempting to call len on it will result in a TypeError.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to create a comma-separated string of column names using the self.columns variable, but it does not handle the case when self.columns is None. This results in a TypeError when the length of None is checked.

   (b) The GitHub issue information confirms that the root cause of the issue is related to self.columns being set to None and the buggy function not handling this case properly.

4. The potential approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length.
   - Providing a default value for colnames if self.columns is None.
   - Restructuring the logic to handle the case when self.columns is None.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for self.columns not being None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the function does not encounter a TypeError when self.columns is None. This updated code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
