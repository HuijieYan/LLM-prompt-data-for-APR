The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to find the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not None. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to find its length. Additionally, I changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` call to properly call the function.
