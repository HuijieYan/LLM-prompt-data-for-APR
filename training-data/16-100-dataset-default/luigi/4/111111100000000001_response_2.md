The potential error in the buggy function is with the `options=self.copy_options` line. The function is trying to use the `copy_options` method as a reference, but it should be called as `self.copy_options()` to execute the method and get its return value.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method using `self.copy_options()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
By calling `self.copy_options()` as a method, we can correctly use the return value of the `copy_options` function in the cursor execute statement.
