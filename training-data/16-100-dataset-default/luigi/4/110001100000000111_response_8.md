1. The problematic function `copy` is trying to execute a Redshift COPY command. It references two other functions, `_credentials` and `copy_options` from the same file, but not the same class. The issue on GitHub points to a TypeError that occurs when `self.columns` is None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement checking the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is None, then calling `len(self.columns)` will result in a TypeError.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `copy` is attempting to use `self.columns` without proper validation, leading to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
   (b). The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly causing the bug.
   (c). The GitHub issue reveals that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is None, leading to a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Validate `self.columns` before using it in the if statement to avoid the TypeError.
   (b). Handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `copy`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # validate self.columns before using it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we validate `self.columns` before accessing its length, thus avoiding the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
