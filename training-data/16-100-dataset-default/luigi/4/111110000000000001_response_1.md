The potential error location within the 'copy' function is in the 'cursor.execute' method. The 'copy_options' function is not being called properly, as it lacks the parentheses for the function call, and the result should be included in the string that is being formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the 'copy_options' function is not being called correctly, and its result is not being included in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, the 'copy_options' function needs to be called with parentheses, and the result needs to be included in the SQL query string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other code)

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, the 'copy_options' function is called with parentheses and its result is included in the SQL query string. This should fix the bug.
