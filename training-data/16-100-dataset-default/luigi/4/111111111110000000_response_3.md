The issue here is that the `columns` attribute is of type `None`, so the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` is causing a `TypeError`. To fix this, we can simply check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, and we only proceed with getting the column names if `self.columns` is not `None`.
- Fixed the `self.copy_options` call to include parentheses for a function call.

These changes should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `columns` is `None`.
