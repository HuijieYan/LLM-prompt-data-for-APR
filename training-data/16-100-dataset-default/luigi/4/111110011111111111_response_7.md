Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` of the `copy` function. This line is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

Bug's cause:

(a). The buggy function:
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None.

(b). The buggy class:
The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is not handling the case where `columns` is set to None properly, leading to the issue in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function.

(c). The failing test and error message:
The failing test is designed to run the `copy` function with `columns` set to None. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` due to it being None.

(d). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value:
The expected behavior is that when `columns` is None, it should not be used to check its length in the `copy` function. However, the actual behavior leads to a TypeError due to this incorrect check.

(e). The GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue highlights that this issue occurs when `columns = None` to prohibit table creation in Redshift COPY jobs, and suggests a solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
- Handle the case where `columns` is None properly in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
