The buggy code has a couple of issues that need to be fixed. Below is the corrected version of the code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other functions and comments)

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The changes made to the `copy` function include:
1. Checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
2. Calling the `copy_options` function with `()` to execute it.

With these changes, the TypeError encountered in the failing test should be resolved.
