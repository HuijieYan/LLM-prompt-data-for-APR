The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We need to add a check to handle this scenario and set `colnames` to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
