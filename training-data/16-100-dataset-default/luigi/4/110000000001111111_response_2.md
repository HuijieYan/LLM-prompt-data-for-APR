The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where it checks the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, then the code will raise an error when trying to check the length.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not properly handle the case when self.columns is None, which leads to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix the bug, we can update the if condition to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will ensure that the code does not raise a TypeError when self.columns is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Update the condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code explicitly checks if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
