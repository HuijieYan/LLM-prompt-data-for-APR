The issue in the provided code is that the `self.columns` attribute is assumed to be a list, and when it is None, the buggy function raises a TypeError. To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is None and provide a default value for `colnames` in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is not None and has a length greater than 0, we construct the `colnames` string as before. Otherwise, if `self.columns` is None or empty, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This ensures that the function won't raise a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Additionally, I have also corrected `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to ensure it is called as a function.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None without raising a TypeError. This should resolve the failing test.
