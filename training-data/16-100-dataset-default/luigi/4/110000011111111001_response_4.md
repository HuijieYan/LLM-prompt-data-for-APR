The issue here is with the `columns` variable being passed as `None`, which is causing an error when attempting to check its length in the `copy` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` method to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking for it before attempting to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` method will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the TypeError that was causing the test to fail. This should allow the function to work correctly and pass the failing test.
