The potential error location within the buggy function is at the if statement where it checks the length of self.columns.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to check the length of self.columns without verifying if self.columns is not None, which leads to a TypeError when self.columns is None.

The GitHub issue suggests that the solution would be to change the if statement to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

To fix the bug, the if statement in the copy function needs to be updated to handle the case when self.columns is None. Here's the corrected code for the copy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the if statement first checks if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError. This will resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
