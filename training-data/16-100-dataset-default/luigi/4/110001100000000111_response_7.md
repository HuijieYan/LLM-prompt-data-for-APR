Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function 'copy' is trying to check the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns exists.
(b). The related functions _credentials and copy_options are not directly related to the bug, but they are called within the buggy function.
(c). The GitHub issue information suggests that when self.columns is None (to prohibit table creation), the buggy function fails because it tries to check the length of None, resulting in a TypeError.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the if statement to first check if self.columns exists before checking its length. This would prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the if statement first checks if self.columns exists before attempting to check its length, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
