Potential error location: The if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` could be the cause of the error.

Cause of the bug:
The error message indicates that the TypeError is because the `self.columns` attribute is of type NoneType, and the buggy code does not handle this case properly. The GitHub issue also suggests that passing `columns = None` should prohibit table creation, but currently it causes the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is None and modify the logic accordingly.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, which resolves the TypeError. It also handles the case where `self.columns` is None, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
