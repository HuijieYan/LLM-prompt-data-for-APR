1. The buggy function `copy` is used to define copying from s3 into Redshift. It calls two other functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` from the same file but different classes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` without parentheses to call the related functions.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `copy` is not calling the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions correctly. It should use parentheses to call these functions.
   (b). The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not being called correctly within the `copy` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Add parentheses to the function calls within the `copy` function to properly call `_credentials` and `copy_options`.
   (b). Ensure that the related functions are called correctly within the `copy` function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # Corrected the function call with parentheses
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the function call with parentheses
    )
```
