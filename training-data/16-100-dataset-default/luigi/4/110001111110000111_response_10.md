The issue in the buggy function is caused by the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is None and then an attempt is made to check its length.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and then calls `task.run()`. Inside `run`, the `copy` method is called with `cursor` and `f`, and then the `len(self.columns)` check fails, resulting in the TypeError.

The GitHub issue title is "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", and the detailed description suggests changing the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as a possible solution.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the `copy` method to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can use the suggested approach of checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it's not None, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This change will ensure that the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
