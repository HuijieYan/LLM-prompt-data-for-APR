The issue in the buggy function is that it's not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This causes the TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix this, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before performing the `len` operation. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns is not None:` to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we directly set `colnames` to an empty string. This should resolve the TypeError caused by trying to get the length of `None` and fix the buggy function.
