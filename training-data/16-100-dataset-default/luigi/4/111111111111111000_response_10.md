The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can fix this by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with getting its length and constructing the `colnames` string. Otherwise, `colnames` remains an empty string. Additionally, we also modified `self.copy_options` to call the method with `()` for proper function invocation.

With this change, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the failing test should pass.
