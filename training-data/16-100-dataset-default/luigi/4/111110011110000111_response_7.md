The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not None.

The bug's cause is that when `columns` is set to None, the function tries to find the length of a NoneType object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, and updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code includes the check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not None before checking its length. This will resolve the TypeError when `columns` is set to None and the function should now pass the failing test and GitHub issue should be resolved.
