The potential error location within the function is the `options=self.copy_options` line. Here the `copy_options` method is being referenced without calling it. It should be `options=self.copy_options()`. This is the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method and also correct the formatting of the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected code, we have added the parentheses to call the `copy_options` method, so that it is executed and returns the options string to be included in the `COPY` statement.
