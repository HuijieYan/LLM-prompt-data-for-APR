The potential error in the buggy function is that the `creds` and `options` variables are not getting the expected values when the `cursor.execute` function is called. The `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are not called properly to get their return values.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions with the `self` parameter and concatenate their return values properly in the `cursor.execute` function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials()  # calling _credentials function
    options = self.copy_options()  # calling copy_options function

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `creds` and `options` variables will have the correct values when passed to the `cursor.execute` function, and the function should work as expected.
