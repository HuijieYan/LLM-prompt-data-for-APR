The issue in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is None, then `colnames` should also be None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = None
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames is not None else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and it will pass the failing test.
