1. The buggy function is part of the S3CopyToTable class and it is responsible for defining the copying from s3 into Redshift. It uses the _credentials and copy_options functions from the same class to retrieve credentials and copy options for the COPY command. The potential error location is in the cursor.execute() method where it constructs the SQL query for the COPY command.

2. The potential error is in the formatting of the SQL query inside the cursor.execute() method. The call to self._credentials() should be a method call, and self.copy_options should also be a method call.

3. The bug's cause is that the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not being called as methods. They should be called with parentheses at the end in order to execute them and get their return values.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that self._credentials() and self.copy_options are being called as methods. Also, we need to make sure that the result of self.copy_options is concatenated as a string in the SQL query.

5. Corrected code:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
