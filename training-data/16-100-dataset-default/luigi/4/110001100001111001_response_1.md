The issue in the buggy function is with how the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are being called. Additionally, the `source` and `creds` variables are not being properly formatted in the `cursor.execute` statement.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the usage of `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options`, which should be called as methods of the same object (`self`), but instead being directly accessed from the class. Additionally, the `source` and `creds` variables are not properly formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are not called as methods of the `self` object, and the `source` and `creds` variables are not properly formatted in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call `_credentials` and `copy_options` as methods of the `self` object, and properly format the `source` and `creds` variables in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_iam_role={creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- `_credentials` and `copy_options` are called as methods of the `self` object.
- The `creds` variable is properly formatted as `'aws_iam_role={creds}'`.
- The `options` variable is also properly formatted and called as a method by using `self.copy_options()`.
