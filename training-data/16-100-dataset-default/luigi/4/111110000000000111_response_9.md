1. The buggy function is a part of the S3CopyToTable class, which is a task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3. The copy function within this class is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a failure when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns=None to prohibit table creation, leading to a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the copy function is the line where it checks the length of self.columns. This is likely where the TypeError is being raised.

3. (a). The buggy function, 'copy', is attempting to execute a COPY command to load data from S3 into Redshift. It is using string formatting to build the SQL command dynamically. The bug is related to the condition for checking the length of self.columns.
   (b). The S3CopyToTable class inherits from rdbms.CopyToTable and _CredentialsMixin.
   (c). The GitHub issue reports that the bug is caused by a failure when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns=None to prohibit table creation, resulting in a TypeError. The root cause appears to be related to a specific line of code in the Luigi library.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if self.columns is None before attempting to access its length.
   - Handling the case where self.columns is None explicitly.
   - Refactoring the code to handle the scenario where columns are not provided more gracefully.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the if condition checks if self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should resolve the TypeError that occurs when columns are not provided.
