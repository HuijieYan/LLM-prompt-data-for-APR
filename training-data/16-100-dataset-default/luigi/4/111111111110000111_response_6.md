The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

The bug's cause is due to the fact that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, the code is still trying to get its length, resulting in a `TypeError`. This is in line with the failing test and the error message posted in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
- Using an `if self.columns:` condition to check if `self.columns` has any value before proceeding to check its length.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:  # Check if columns is not None before proceeding
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns:` condition, we are ensuring that the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to get its length, which resolves the issue.

This corrected code would pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the given GitHub issue.
