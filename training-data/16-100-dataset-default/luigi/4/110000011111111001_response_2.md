The issue within the buggy function is with the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line. The error message indicates that it is trying to take the length of a `NoneType`, which means `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking for it before trying to get the length.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError that was occurring. This should make the function able to handle cases where `self.columns` is None.
