The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case when self.columns is None. This causes a TypeError when trying to retrieve the length of self.columns.

To fix the bug, we can modify the buggy function to check if self.columns is not None before attempting to retrieve its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now check if self.columns is not None before trying to retrieve its length, which will prevent the TypeError from occurring.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
