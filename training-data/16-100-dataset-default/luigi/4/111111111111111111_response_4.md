Upon analyzing the provided information, it is evident that the issue is caused by the expression `len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates a TypeError because `self.columns` is None and the code tries to get the length of a NoneType object.

To rectify the bug, the logical condition should be updated to first check if `self.columns` exists, and then proceed to check its length.

Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, the potential solution is to modify the condition in the `copy` function as follows:

```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

This ensures that the `len` function is only called if `self.columns` is not None. 

The corrected code for the `copy` function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
