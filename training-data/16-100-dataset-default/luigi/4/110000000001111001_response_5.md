Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is in the construction of the SQL query inside the cursor.execute() method. There is a missing closing parenthesis for the format method.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the missing closing parenthesis for the format method inside the cursor.execute() method. This causes a syntax error when trying to execute the SQL query.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the closing parenthesis for the format method is correctly placed in the SQL query inside the cursor.execute() method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} 
     from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
     )
    )
```

With this correction, the closing parenthesis for the format method is placed correctly, and the buggy function is expected to work as intended, satisfying the input/output variable information provided.
