Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. This condition does not check if `self.columns` is None before attempting to retrieve its length, which causes the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.
(b). The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly related to the bug.
(c). The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function fails when `self.columns` is None.
(d). The GitHub issue information also confirms that the bug arises from running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None, which leads to a TypeError due to `len(None)`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code adds a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length. This fix will prevent the TypeError that occurs when `self.columns` is None.
