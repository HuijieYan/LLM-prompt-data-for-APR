The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement checking the length of self.columns. 
The bug's cause is that when columns are not provided (i.e., None), the code does not handle this case and attempts to access the length of None, resulting in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the if statement to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.
2. Handle the case where self.columns is None separately and do not attempt to access its length.
3. Update the logic to handle cases where columns are not provided.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code explicitly checks if self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length, resolving the issue of accessing the length of None. It also calls the copy_options function correctly by adding parentheses. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
