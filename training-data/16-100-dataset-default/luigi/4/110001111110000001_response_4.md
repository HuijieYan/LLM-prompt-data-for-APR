1. The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. The related functions are `_credentials` and `copy_options` which are also in the same file, but not the same class. The failing test is testing the scenario where the `columns` parameter is `None`, and the error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised due to the attempt to use the `len()` function on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the line with the `if` statement checking the length of `self.columns`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is incorrectly trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not `None`. The failing test is providing the input of `columns=None`, and the error message shows that a `TypeError` is raised when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use the `len()` function on it.
   - Modify the logic of the function to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using len()
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, before attempting to use the `len()` function on `self.columns`, a check is added to ensure that it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test. Additionally, the `copy_options` function is also correctly called as a method with `self.copy_options()`.
