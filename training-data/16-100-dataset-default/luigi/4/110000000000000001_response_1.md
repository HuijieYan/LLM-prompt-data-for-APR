1. The buggy function is a method called copy that is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift.

2. The potential error in the function is the cursor.execute() call, where the query is not being executed properly. 

3. The bug is caused because the cursor.execute() call is not properly formatted, the string formatting is incorrect, and there is a missing closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() function.

4. To fix the bug, we can correct the string formatting and add the missing closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
     )
    )
```

In the corrected code, the closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() function has been added at the end of the query, and the string formatting has been adjusted to ensure the query is executed properly.
