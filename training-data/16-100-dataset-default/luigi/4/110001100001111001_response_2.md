The potential error in the buggy function is in the `cursor.execute` statement where `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called but the functions are not being called correctly. 

To fix the bug, we need to call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions as methods of the class `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`. We also need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is called as a method and not just as a string.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the input parameters correctly and the output should match the expected values.
