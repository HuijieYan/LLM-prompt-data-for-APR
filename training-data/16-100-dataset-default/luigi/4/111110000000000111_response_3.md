1. The buggy function `copy` is a method of the class `S3CopyToTable`, which is used for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3. The function is responsible for defining the copying process from s3 into Redshift. The github issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" indicates that when columns are set to None, the Redshift COPY job fails in luigi 2.7.1.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which is assuming that `self.columns` is always a list and causing the issue when it is set to None.

3. (a). The buggy function `copy` is trying to construct a COPY query for Redshift to copy data from s3 into Redshift. It uses `self.columns` to determine if column names need to be included in the query.
   (b). The class `S3CopyToTable` contains the `copy` function and is used for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3. It also contains the `copy_options` function.
   (c). The GitHub Issue provides pertinent information that the bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to a TypeError when it is set to None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length.
   - Handle the case where `self.columns` is None by providing a default behavior or raising a more informative error message.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length, and then proceed with constructing the `COPY` query accordingly. This approach addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post by handling the case where `self.columns` is set to None.
