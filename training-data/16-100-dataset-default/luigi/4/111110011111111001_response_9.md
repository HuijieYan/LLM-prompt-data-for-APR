The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'copy' function at the line 'if len(self.columns) > 0:'. The error is caused because the 'self.columns' is set to 'None' which is an unexpected type, and the function is trying to apply the 'len' function to it.

To fix the bug, the 'copy' function should check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to use it. Additionally, the function should handle the case where 'self.columns' is None.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the 'copy' function will now check if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to use it, and will handle the case where 'self.columns' is None. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
