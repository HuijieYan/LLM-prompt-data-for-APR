The issue in the provided function is occurring due to the comparison of columns with None type in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is None, it cannot be compared using `len()`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, a check should be added to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before performing the comparison. If `self.columns` is None, then the `colnames` should also be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source= f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to compare its length, and set `colnames` accordingly. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the buggy function.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test case provided.
