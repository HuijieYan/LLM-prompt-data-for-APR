Potential error location: The potential error location is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is assuming that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This assumption leads to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Suggested fix: Change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length, preventing the TypeError. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
