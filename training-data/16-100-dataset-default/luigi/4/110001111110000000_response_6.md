The issue with the code is that it's trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`. Let's update the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The change made is in the line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. Additionally, the last line `options=self.copy_options` has been updated to `options=self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function.

With these changes, the code should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and call the `copy_options` function correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
