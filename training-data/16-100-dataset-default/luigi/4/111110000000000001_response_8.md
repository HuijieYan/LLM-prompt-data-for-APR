Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses to call the copy_options method
        )
```

The potential error in the original code was the missing parentheses when calling the `copy_options` method in the `format` function. This resulted in the `options` parameter being assigned the function object rather than its return value, causing a TypeError.

To fix this bug, I added parentheses to call the `copy_options` method within the `format` function. This change ensures that the `options` parameter receives the return value of the `copy_options` method rather than the method itself.
