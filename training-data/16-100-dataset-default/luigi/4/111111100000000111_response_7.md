1. The buggy function `copy` from the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift. The issue is related to the `self.columns` attribute, and it seems that the bug causes the `len()` function to be called on a `NoneType` object, resulting in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   This is where the length of `self.columns` is being checked, and if `self.columns` is None, it will result in a TypeError.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function does not properly handle the case where `self.columns` is None. The GitHub issue provides additional context, suggesting that the bug is related to the handling of columns when they are not provided. The call to `len(self.columns)` in the context of `if len(self.columns) > 0` is causing the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
   - Include a condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
   - Potentially provide a default value for `self.columns` if it is None, to avoid the TypeError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

The corrected code includes a check for `self.columns` being not None before attempting to get its length, and handles the case where `self.columns` is None by setting `colnames` to an empty string. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
