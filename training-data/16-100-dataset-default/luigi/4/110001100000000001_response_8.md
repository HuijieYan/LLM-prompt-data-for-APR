The potential error location within the buggy function is the usage of self._credentials() and self.copy_options without invoking them as functions.

The bug's cause is that self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not called as functions, which means they are not being executed to return the required values.

To fix the bug, we need to invoke the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options as functions and obtain their return values to be used in the cursor.execute() statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    creds = self._credentials()  # invoke _credentials() as a function
    options = self.copy_options()  # invoke copy_options() as a function

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=creds,
        options=options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we have invoked the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options() to obtain their return values, which are then used within the cursor.execute() statement.
