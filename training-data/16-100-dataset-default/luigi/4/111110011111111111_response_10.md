Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the line: `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The error occurs because `self.columns` is set to `None`, and `NoneType` object does not have the `len()` method, resulting in a TypeError.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.
(b). The buggy class does not handle the scenario when `columns` are not provided.
(c). The failing test provides the input parameters and the error message that indicate that the issue arises from the attempt to check the length of `None`.
(d). The expected input/output variable value shows that `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to an incorrect check for its length.
(e). The GitHub issue discusses a similar scenario where `columns` set to `None` results in a failure of the Redshift COPY jobs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach is to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `if` condition is modified to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This change ensures that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, as well as address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
