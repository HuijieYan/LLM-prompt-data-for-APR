The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are being called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

It appears that the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are methods of the same class as the `copy` function, and should be called using the `self` reference. However, they are currently being called without the `self` reference.

Additionally, the `copy_options` function is missing the parentheses to indicate that it is a function call.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions with the `self` reference.
2. Add parentheses after `self.copy_options` to indicate that it is a function call.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions and should be able to execute successfully with the correct input parameters.
