The cause of the bug is that the code is trying to check the length of self.columns without first checking if it's not None. This is causing a TypeError when self.columns is None.

The failing test is trying to run the task with columns set to None, which triggers the bug in the copy function. The error message clearly indicates that the issue is with trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

The GitHub issue also points out that the root cause seems to be a specific line in the code and suggests a possible solution to change the if statement to check if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if statement in the copy function to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the if statement checks if self.columns is not None before proceeding to get its length, which should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.

This corrected code should also satisfy the issue reported on GitHub, as it addresses the root cause mentioned in the GitHub issue description.
