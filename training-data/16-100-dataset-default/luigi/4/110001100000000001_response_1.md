The potential error in the buggy function is in the cursor.execute() call. It seems that the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not being called correctly, as they are missing parentheses at the end.

The cause of the bug is that the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not being called with the correct syntax, which leads to a syntax error in the cursor.execute() call.

To fix the bug, we need to call the functions self._credentials() and self.copy_options with parentheses at the end to properly invoke them.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # corrected syntax
        options=self.copy_options())  # corrected syntax
    )
```
