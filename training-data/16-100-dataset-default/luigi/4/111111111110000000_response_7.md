The issue in the `copy` function is that it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. It is trying to call `len()` on `None` which is causing the TypeError. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

I added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to call `len()` on it. I also changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function.
