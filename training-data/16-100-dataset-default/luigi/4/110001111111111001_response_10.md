The buggy function is `copy()` which is called with the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object as `self` and a file path `f`. The function is attempting to access the `columns` attribute of `self` using `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None` or not before calling `len()` on it.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is passing a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns` set to `None`, which causes the error.

To fix this, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` observed in the failing test. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
