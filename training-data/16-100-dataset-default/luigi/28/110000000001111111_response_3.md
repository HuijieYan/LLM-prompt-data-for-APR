The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database. However, it has a bug related to case sensitivity, where the function does not consider the case of the table name when checking for its existence. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which mentions that Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of the table name with the output (stdout) from the Hive command. The function does not account for case differences, leading to test failures.

The bug is caused by the function not considering the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive output. This results in the function failing tests when the case of the table name and the output from Hive do not match.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and aligns with Hive's behavior.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the Hive output, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussion. This updated code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the case sensitivity issue.
