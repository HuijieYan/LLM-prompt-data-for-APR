The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The failing test for this function is trying to test whether the function returns the correct results when called with different parameters. 

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the `run_hive_cmd` commands inside the if-else block. 

The bug's cause is that the `stdout` variable is not being correctly checked in the if-else conditions for whether the table exists or not, leading to incorrect results being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is being checked accurately to determine if the table exists or not. We also need to account for the different scenarios where the function is called based on the presence of the `partition` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if the table exists in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition({partition_filter})')

        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0  # Check if any partitions exist
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
