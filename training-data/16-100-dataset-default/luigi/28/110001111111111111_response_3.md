The issue is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, but Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names. This leads to the failing tests when checking for table existence with different case variations.

To fix this issue, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, the fix addresses the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the table existence check case insensitive.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected in a case-insensitive manner.
