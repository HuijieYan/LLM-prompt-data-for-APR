The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. In some cases, the table names may be in different cases than what is provided as input, causing the function to return incorrect results.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" is related to this bug, pointing out that the current function does not handle case sensitivity properly, and suggesting a fix by checking table names in a case-insensitive manner.

The bug is caused by the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the function to return incorrect results, especially when the table names are in different cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. This is where the case sensitivity issue is not being handled.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive command. This will ensure that the function returns the correct results regardless of the case of the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug and addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
