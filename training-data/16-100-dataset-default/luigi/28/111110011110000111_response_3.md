The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is responsible for checking whether a table exists in the given database and partition. The failing test indicates that the function is case sensitive when checking for table existence, causing the test to fail for tables with different cases.

The error is likely to be in the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function. The function seems to be doing a case-sensitive comparison, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.

The failing test is checking for case insensitivity when calling the `table_exists` function, and it's failing with an assertion error because the function is not handling the case insensitivity correctly.

The GitHub issue highlights that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase or uppercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
