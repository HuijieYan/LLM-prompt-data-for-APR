Upon analyzing the provided code and related information, it is evident that the bug is primarily caused by the case sensitivity issue in the table_exists function of the luigi.contrib.hive module. The failing tests and the GitHub issue both point towards the need to make the table_exists function case insensitive while checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which is not case insensitive.

To fix this bug, we can modify the table_exists function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function works correctly in all scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the table_exists function will now perform case insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

This corrected code should pass the failing test scenarios provided and address the issue raised in the GitHub post. The updated function now handles case sensitivity effectively and provides accurate results when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
