The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should take this into account.

The buggy function `table_exists` is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then comparing the output with the table name. The issue arises when the table name is not in the same case as the output of the Hive command.

The related GitHub issue suggests that tables defined as capitalized may return as lower case in stdout, causing the test to fail. The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, one potential approach is to modify the comparison in the buggy function to use case-insensitive comparison. The condition `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` can be used to check if the table exists in the output of the Hive command, regardless of case.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected code uses case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change addresses the issue posted in the GitHub and ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive.
