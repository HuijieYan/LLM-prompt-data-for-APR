The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It should be checking for the existence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, but it is not doing so correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In this corrected version:
1. We are checking for the existence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd` without using `and` operator.
2. We are using `bool(stdout.strip())` to check if `stdout` has any content.

With these changes, the function should now behave as expected and pass the provided tests.
