The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the return value from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the case where `partition` is None, the function checks if the `stdout` is not empty before returning whether the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, in the case where `partition` is not None, it checks if `stdout` exists but always returns `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the return value from `run_hive_cmd` consistently and also properly check if the table exists in the `stdout`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function to consistently check if the table exists in the `stdout`, and return `True` or `False` accordingly. We can also handle the `partition` case correctly by incorporating the `self.partition_spec` function appropriately.

Below is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_filter});")
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
