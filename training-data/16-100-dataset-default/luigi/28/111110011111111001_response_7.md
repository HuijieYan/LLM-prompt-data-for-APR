The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional statement where the stdout is being checked. In the if-else block, when the stdout is not an empty string, the function is returning `True` or `False` based on whether stdout is present or not. However, in the failing test cases, the condition is not being handled correctly which is causing the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements and their logic to handle the expected stdout content correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        partition_string = '/'.join([f'{key}={value}' for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
