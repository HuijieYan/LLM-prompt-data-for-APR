1. The buggy function is `table_exists`, which checks whether a table exists in a given database and partition. This function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive command and obtain the output. Additionally, it calls the `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks whether the `partition` is `None` or not. The if-else statement within the function seems to be where the bug is occurring.

3. (a) The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns an error or when the command execution fails.
   (b) The related function `run_hive_cmd` is responsible for running the Hive command and returning the stdout.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs proper handling of potential errors when calling `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, the conditional statement for checking the existence of a partition may need to be revised.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table), check_return_code=True)
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ''
        for key, value in partition.items():
            partition_str += "{0}='{1}', ".format(key, value)
        partition_str = partition_str.rstrip(', ')
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('''use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})'''.format(database, table, partition_str), check_return_code=True)
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is now being called with the `check_return_code` parameter set to `True` to handle any potential errors.
- The partition specification is being constructed by iterating through the key-value pairs and creating the partition string.
- The return statement has been simplified to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.
