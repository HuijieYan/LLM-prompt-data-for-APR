The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison of the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. This can lead to an incorrect result when checking for the existence of a table due to differences in case.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the table name with the stdout is case sensitive. The GitHub issue mentions that tables may be defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase, causing the test to fail when checking for an existing table.

To fix the bug, a case-insensitive comparison should be performed when checking if the table exists. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the check for table existence is case insensitive as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
