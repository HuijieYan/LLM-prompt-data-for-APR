The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that it does a case-sensitive check for the table name in the `stdout`. This causes the function to fail when the table name has a different case in the Hive database.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code makes the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This change will resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue and also satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.

The GitHub issue title for this bug is "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and the detailed description is "Check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues."
