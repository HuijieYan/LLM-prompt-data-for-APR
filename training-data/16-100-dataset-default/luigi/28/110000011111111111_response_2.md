The issue seems to be related to the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function of the Hive client. The function uses the `show tables` or `show partitions` command in Hive to check for the existence of a table or partition, but it does not account for case sensitivity.

The failing tests indicate that the function is failing when checking for the existence of tables with different cases. For example, when checking for the table "MyTable", the function returns False instead of True.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

To fix this issue, the function should convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partitions))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle case insensitive table existence checks in Hive. This would address the failing tests and also resolve the issue raised in the GitHub comments.
