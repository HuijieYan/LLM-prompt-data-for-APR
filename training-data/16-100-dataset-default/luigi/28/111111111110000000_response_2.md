# The corrected version of the buggy function should be:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The issue with the original implementation was that the `partition_spec` method was never called. Instead, the partition condition was being built directly within the `table_exists` method. Additionally, the condition for whether the table exists or not wasn't being checked properly.
