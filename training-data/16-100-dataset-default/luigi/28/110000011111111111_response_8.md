The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database. This causes the tests to fail when the table names are provided in a different case. The github issue references this problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases, and it also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it effectively resolves the issue posted in the GitHub, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
