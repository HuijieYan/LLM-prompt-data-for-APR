The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when the table name capitalization does not match the expected lowercase format returned by Hive.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure a case-insensitive check.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code makes the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures that the function will work correctly regardless of the capitalization of the table name in the Hive database.

The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid issues with table name capitalization. The suggested fix aligns with the corrected code provided above.

The issue on GitHub is titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and proposes checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. This corresponds to the proposed fix for the bug.

With the corrected code, the function will now satisfy the expected input/output variable values provided, and it successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
