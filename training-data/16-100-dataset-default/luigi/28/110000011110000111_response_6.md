The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` within the `contrib/hive.py` file. It is being tested by the `test_table_exists` method in the `contrib/hive_test.py` file. The failing test is due to the `table_exists` method not being case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` method is in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout`. The method is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The failing test and error message indicate that the method is not returning the correct results when checking for the existence of a table, especially when case sensitivity is involved. The GitHub issue provides further details on how the method should compare the table names in a case insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should compare the table names in a case insensitive manner as suggested in the GitHub issue. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method should now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.

By making this change, the method will now compare the table names in a case insensitive manner, ensuring that the test cases pass and addressing the issue raised in the GitHub.
