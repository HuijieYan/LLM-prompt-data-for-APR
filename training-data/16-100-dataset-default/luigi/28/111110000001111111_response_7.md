The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database. This results in failing tests when checking for table existence with different capitalizations. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" describe the problem and propose a solution to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the hive command. The function simply checks if the table name is in the output without considering the case.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                          ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_output))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparing them, effectively making the check case insensitive. This fix satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
