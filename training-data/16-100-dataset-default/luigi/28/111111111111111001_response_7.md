The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by how the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with multiple commands. The function is checking for the presence of a table in the default database, but it is not handling the case-insensitivity of the table name. Additionally, when a partition is provided, the `partition_spec` function is not being called properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to handle the case-insensitivity of the table name and correctly call the `partition_spec` function when a partition is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        partition_str = " and ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

This code handles the case-insensitivity of the table name by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison. It also correctly constructs the command to retrieve the partition information and checks if the `stdout` is empty to determine if the partition exists.

This corrected code should now pass the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
