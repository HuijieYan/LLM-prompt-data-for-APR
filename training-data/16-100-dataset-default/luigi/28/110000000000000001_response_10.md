1. The buggy function is a method that checks if a table exists in a given database. It first checks if the table exists without a partition, and if not, it then checks if the table exists with a specific partition.

2. The potential error in the function could be in the second part where it checks for the existence of the table with a partition. The conditional statements and the formatting of the command can be improved.

3. The bug's cause is that the second conditional statement does not handle the case where there is no output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to:
   - Check if the stdout variable is not empty before returning True in the second part of the function.
   - Refactor the conditional statements to make the code more readable and handle edge cases appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```
