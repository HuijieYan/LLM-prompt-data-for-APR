The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. This function checks for the existence of a table in the specified database and partition.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `else` condition where the `stdout` variable is being assigned the result of running a Hive command.

The bug's cause is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly in the `else` condition when `partition` is not `None`. Additionally, the string formatting in the else condition is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `run_hive_cmd` function in both the if and else conditions, and correct the string formatting in the else condition.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ", ".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec_str})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we properly call the `run_hive_cmd` function in the else condition and use f-strings for string formatting for better readability. Additionally, we join the partition spec in the else condition to build the correct command for `run_hive_cmd`.
