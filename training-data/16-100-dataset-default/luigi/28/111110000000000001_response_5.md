1. The buggy function is within the HiveCommandClient class and is used to check if a table exists in a given database. It takes the inputs table, database, and partition, with the latter being an optional parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement where it checks if the partition is None. 

3. The bug's cause is that when the partition is not None, the function incorrectly constructs the command to check for partition existence in the table.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the command to check for partition existence and handle it appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_list = ["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()]
                partition_condition = ','.join(partition_list)
            else:
                partition_condition = partition
            
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_condition))
            return bool(stdout)  # Convert the stdout to boolean and return
```
