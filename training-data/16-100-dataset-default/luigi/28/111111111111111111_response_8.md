The buggy function is `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from the hive command.

The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in the database. In the failing test cases, the issue arises when the table name is in a different case than the one returned by the hive command, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command should be case insensitive. The output from the hive command and the table name should be converted to the same case before comparison to ensure consistency.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command. This will address the case sensitivity issues highlighted in the failing test cases.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and also resolves the issue raised in the GitHub report.
