1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database with optional partition information. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to format the partition information.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else statement where the `run_hive_cmd` is called with incorrect syntax for using the partition information.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect syntax in the `run_hive_cmd` call when trying to execute a Hive command with partition information. The `run_hive_cmd` call within the else statement uses the `partition_spec` function to format the partition, but the syntax is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the syntax used in the `run_hive_cmd` call within the else statement and ensure it is correct for executing Hive commands with partition information.
   - Verify that the `partition_spec` function is correctly formatting the partition information.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```
