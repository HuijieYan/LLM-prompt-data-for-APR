1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which extends the `HiveClient` class. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command to check if a table exists. It also calls the `partition_spec` function to get the partition information.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `run_hive_cmd` function call, as well as the `partition_spec` function call.

3. Cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function is not executing the `run_hive_cmd` function properly in both cases.
   (b). The `partition_spec` function may not be returning the correct information for the partition.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure it is running the Hive command properly.
   (b). Check the implementation of the `partition_spec` function to ensure it is returning the correct partition information.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # implementation of the partition_spec function goes here
        # this function was not provided, so the implementation is assumed

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))  # changed run_hive_cmd to self.run_hive_cmd
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))  # changed run_hive_cmd to self.run_hive_cmd
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code, `run_hive_cmd` is called using `self.run_hive_cmd` to ensure it is properly executed. Additionally, the code has been modified to handle the stdout check using `bool(stdout)` instead of the explicit if-else condition.
