The potential error in the `table_exists` function is when it constructs the `stdout` variable using the `self.partition_spec` method. It should instead use the `partition` dictionary directly to construct the partition string.

The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the function is not returning the expected values. In the failing tests, the expected values are not being returned by the function due to the incorrect construction of the `stdout` variable.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to correctly construct the `stdout` variable when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = '/'.join([f"{key}={value}" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
