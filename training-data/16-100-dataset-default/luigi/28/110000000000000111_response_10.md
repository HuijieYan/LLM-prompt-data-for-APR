1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method that checks if a table exists in a given database and, if a partition is specified, it also checks if a partition exists in the table. The GitHub issue is related to the case-sensitivity of table names when checking for their existence.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of table names. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, the function does not handle the case-insensitivity of table names, causing the test to fail when table names are capitalized.

3. 
   a. The buggy function:
      The buggy function `table_exists` does not account for the case-insensitivity of table names when checking for their existence.

   b. The GitHub Issue information:
      The GitHub issue highlights the issue with case sensitivity when checking for table existence, and it suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Modify the function to handle case-insensitivity by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing.
   b. Use a case-insensitive comparison method or regular expression to check for table existence.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
