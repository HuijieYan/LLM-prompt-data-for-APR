1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. In the `table_exists` function, it checks if a table exists in the database and optionally in a specific partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to retrieve partition information.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of a table in a particular partition.

3. The bug's cause is due to the incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the incorrect string formatting in the `stdout` assignment. Additionally, there are multiple `partition_spec` functions defined which could lead to confusion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly call the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions with the appropriate arguments.
   - Refactor the code to handle table existence checks in partitions in a clearer manner.
   - Remove the multiple `partition_spec` functions to avoid confusion.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we use proper string formatting to construct the Hive commands for table existence checks with and without partitions. We also directly call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct arguments, and construct the partition string for the `show partitions` command. Additionally, the duplicate `partition_spec` functions have been removed for clarity.
