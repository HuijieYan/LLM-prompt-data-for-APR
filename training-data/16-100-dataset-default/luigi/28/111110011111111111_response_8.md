The potential error in the buggy function "table_exists" is that it does not handle the case sensitivity of the table names when comparing with the stdout from the `hive` command.

The failing tests show that when the function is called with a table name that is capitalized, the check against the stdout is failing because the stdout returns lowercase table names.

The GitHub issue also confirms that there is a discrepancy between the table names being case insensitive in Hive and the function not handling this properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the "table_exists" function to ensure that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the stdout from the `hive` command.

Here's an updated version of the "table_exists" function that addresses the issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function now checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the failing tests and also address the issue raised in the GitHub post.

The updated function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
