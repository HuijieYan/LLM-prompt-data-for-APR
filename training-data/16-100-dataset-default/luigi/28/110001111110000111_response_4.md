Analysis:
The buggy function is `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` function from the same file. The failing test is checking the case insensitivity of the table name when calling `table_exists`. The error message indicates that the test is failing because it expects the table name to be case insensitive, but it's not working as expected.

The GitHub issue describes the problem where tables with capitalization are not being handled correctly, and suggests that a fix could be implemented by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that when checking for the existence of a table, the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The `table_exists` function is not taking into account the possibility of the table name being in a different case than expected.

Fix:
We need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. When checking if the table exists, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should fix the case insensitivity issue and make the `table_exists` function work as intended.

GitHub Issue:

Title: Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive

Detailed description:
The issue is related to the case insensitivity of table names when checking for their existence. The suggestion for fixing the issue is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. The corrected code implements this solution.

With this fix, the failing test cases should now pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
