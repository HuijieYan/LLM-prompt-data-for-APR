The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition in the `table_exists` function where it checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty. This condition is causing the test to fail because it is not handling the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.

The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not correctly handling the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which leads to incorrect evaluations when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `table_exists` function handles the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. Specifically, it should check the response for the table name or partition key when determining the existence of a table or partition.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we have changed the way the `stdout` variable is handled to accurately check for the existence of the table and partition. This should pass the failing test and resolve the bug.
