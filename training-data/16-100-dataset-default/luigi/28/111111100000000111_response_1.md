1. The buggy function table_exists is intended to check whether a table exists in a Hive database, but it is not case insensitive, which causes issues when the table name is defined with different cases. The related class is HiveCommandClient, which contains the buggy function and other related functions like partition_spec. 

The GitHub issue (#896) points out that table_exists should be case insensitive, and proposes a fix to check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. 

3. The cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function table_exists does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
   (b). The related class HiveCommandClient contains the table_exists function and other related functions, which are not handling case sensitivity properly.
   (c). The related functions like partition_spec do not have an impact on the bug.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information suggests that the bug is due to case sensitivity and proposes a fix to check table.lower() against stdout.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the table_exists function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout from the Hive command.
   (b). Use the proposed fix from the GitHub issue to check table.lower() in stdout in the table_exists function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name is converted to lowercase using table.lower() before comparing it with the lowercase stdout using stdout.lower(), making the comparison case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue in the table_exists function.
