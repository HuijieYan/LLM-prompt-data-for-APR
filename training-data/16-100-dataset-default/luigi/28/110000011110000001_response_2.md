Potential Issue with the Buggy Function:

The bug seems to be in the `table_exists` function's conditional logic. The issue is likely related to how the function checks whether the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Cause of the Bug:

The buggy function's logic for checking the table existence is flawed. When the `run_command` returns "OK\nmytable" and the function is called with `table_exists("mytable")`, it should return True. However, as per the error message, it is returning False.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:

1. Modify the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to ensure that the logic correctly interprets the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Adjust the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function based on the different scenarios.
3. Ensure that the `table_exists` function can handle cases where the table name is not an exact match in the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

Corrected Code:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout  # Check if the table exists in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, indicating the table exists
```

By making the above adjustments to the `table_exists` function, it should address the faulty logic and correctly handle the different scenarios for checking table existence. This corrected code should ensure that the function passes the failing test provided.
