The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks if the partition is None and then calls the `run_hive_cmd` function accordingly. However, in the else clause, it is not using the `self.partition_spec` method properly. This is causing the function to return an incorrect value for the partitioned table check.

The failing test cases show that the function returns incorrect values for table existence and partitioned table checks. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected values for these checks.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the partitioned table case and use the `self.partition_spec` method to generate the partition specification string.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_string = ''
        for key, value in partition.items():
            partition_spec_string += "{}='{}', ".format(key, value)
        partition_spec_string = partition_spec_string[:-2]  # remove the last comma and space
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec_string))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle both standard table existence checks and partitioned table checks, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
