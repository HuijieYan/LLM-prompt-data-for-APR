The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable. In some cases, the function is not returning the correct value based on the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The function is checking whether the `table` exists in the `stdout` output, but it doesn't handle the case where the table name appears as a substring within another table name. For example, if the table is 'mytable' and the `stdout` contains 'mytable2', the function will incorrectly return `True`.

To fix this bug, it is better to use a regex to specifically match the table name in the `stdout`. This will provide a more exact match, ensuring that only the table being searched for is considered.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), stdout) is not None
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification utilizes the `re.search` method to look for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout`, using word boundaries `\b` to ensure it's a complete match.

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable requirements.
