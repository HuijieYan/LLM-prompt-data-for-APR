1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks whether a table exists in the specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to build the partition specification. The bug might be related to how the `table_exists` function is using the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the usage of `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec(partition)`. 

3. The bug's cause is in the incorrect usage of `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec(partition)`:

   (a). The buggy function incorrectly uses the `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` functions without properly instantiating the objects or importing the functions. This could potentially lead to the functions not being found or used correctly within the context of the `table_exists` function.

   (b). The `partition_spec` function is defined multiple times in the same file, which could cause confusion and potential errors when trying to call it within the `table_exists` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the necessary functions into the `table_exists` class so that they can be accessed and used properly.
   - Ensure that the `partition_spec` function is properly defined and that the correct version of the function is being called within the `table_exists` function.
   - Modify the usage of `run_hive_cmd` and `self.partition_spec` to ensure that they are being used in the correct context.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import the necessary functions
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# Correct the usage of the partition_spec function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Correct the format of the Hive command
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
