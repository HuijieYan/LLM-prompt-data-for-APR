1. The buggy function is called `table_exists`, and it checks if a table exists in a given database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to create a partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the `else` block, where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with a formatted string.

3. The bug's cause is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is called multiple times without a clear purpose.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly with the appropriate arguments.
   - Refactoring the `partition_spec` function calls to be more concise and have a clear purpose.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_str = ','.join([f'{key}={value}' for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec_str})')
        return bool(stdout)
```
