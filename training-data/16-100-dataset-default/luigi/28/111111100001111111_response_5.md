The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. This causes tests to fail when tables are defined with different case styles (e.g., capitalized or lower case underscored names) than what is used in the function call.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the fact that the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, without considering case differences.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function will convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lower case before comparing them, effectively making the comparison case insensitive.

This solution addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive and resolving the problem of failing tests due to case differences in table names.
