The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case where a partition is provided properly. In the else block, it's calling `run_hive_cmd` with a formatted string that includes the result of `self.partition_spec(partition)`, but it should be directly passing the partition value to `run_hive_cmd`.

The test is failing because in case 2, the test for table_exists with "MyTable" is returning False, which is not expected. This shows that the function is not handling case insensitivity properly. 

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should be modified to handle the partition case correctly, and case insensitivity should be added for table name comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partitions = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partitions))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle partitions correctly as well as case insensitivity for the table name comparison. This should fix the failing test cases and produce the expected outcomes.
