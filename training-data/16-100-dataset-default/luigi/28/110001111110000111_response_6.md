The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file. The function first checks if a partition is specified, and then runs a hive command to determine if the table exists. The function seems to have a problem with case sensitivity, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` checks the `table_exists` function with different table names, including mixed case names, and expects the function to be case insensitive. The error message shows that the function is returning False instead of True for a mixed case table name, leading to an assertion error.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking if a table exists.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to the actual table name. This comparison is not taking case into account, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the function is now case insensitive. It will pass the failing test `test_table_exists` and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
