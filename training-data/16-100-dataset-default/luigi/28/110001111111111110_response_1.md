The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity, causing the tests to fail when checking for existing tables. To fix this, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when comparing table names.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for case insensitive comparison, which resolves the failing tests. This change also ensures that the function behaves consistently with Hive's case insensitivity.
