The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the test to fail when checking for a table that exists but with a different case.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, ensuring that it can accurately determine the existence of the table regardless of case.

This corrected code should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as requested.
