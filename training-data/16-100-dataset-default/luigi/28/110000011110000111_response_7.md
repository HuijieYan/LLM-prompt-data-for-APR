The buggy function is `table_exists` which is supposed to check if a table exists in the database. The failing test is `test_table_exists`, which tests the behavior of the `table_exists` function. The error message is AssertionError because the function is not returning the expected value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name to the output of `run_hive_cmd`. It seems that there is a case sensitivity issue where the table name is not being properly compared to the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to ensure that it performs a case insensitive comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd`. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to a common case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now performs a case insensitive comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd`, ensuring that the test cases will pass. This also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post about making the table_exists function case insensitive.

The GitHub issue title for this bug can be "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and the detailed description can include the information about checking stdout against table.lower() to avoid case sensitivity issues.
