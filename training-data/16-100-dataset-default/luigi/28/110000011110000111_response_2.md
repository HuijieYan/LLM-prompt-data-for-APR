The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The error occurs due to case sensitivity in the comparison of table names. The failing test is checking for the existence of a table with different cases, and the function does not handle this correctly, resulting in assertions failure.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of table names in the `stdout`. As Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive.

The bug's cause is the failure to account for case insensitivity when comparing table names. This causes the function to incorrectly identify table existence, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to be case insensitive, in line with the behavior of Hive. We can use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now performs case-insensitive comparison of table names, which should resolve the failing test cases. Additionally, this change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".

By making this change, the function now handles table existence checks in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring compatibility with Hive's behavior. This resolves the issue reported in the failing test and aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
