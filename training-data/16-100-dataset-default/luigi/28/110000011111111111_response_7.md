The bug in the provided function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This causes the test cases to fail, as they expect the function to be case insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from the show tables command, without considering the case.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the show tables command.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will now correctly check for the existence of a table in a case insensitive manner and pass the failing test cases. This change will also address the issue posted on GitHub, making the function case insensitive.
