The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not take into account case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issue has been reported on GitHub and it has been suggested to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = ' '.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition
                            ({3})""".format(database, database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, making the comparison case insensitive as expected.

This fix satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
