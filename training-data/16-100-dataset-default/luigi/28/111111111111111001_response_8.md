The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly handle the case when a partition is provided. The function constructs a Hive query incorrectly when a partition is specified, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

The buggy function is not handling partition parameters correctly, as can be seen from the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the Hive query differently when a partition is specified. It should use the `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specification and incorporate it into the Hive query.

Also, the function should check the existence of the table in case of an empty `stdout` instead of returning `False` immediately.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = "partition ({0})".format(self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}".format(database, table, partition_clause))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the partition parameter correctly and pass the failing test cases.
