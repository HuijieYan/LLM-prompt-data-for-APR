The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check whether a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. The issue stems from the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout.

The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` both assert that the function should return `True` when checking for a table that exists, regardless of the case of the table name. However, the function does not currently account for case sensitivity.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" explains that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, as Hive is case insensitive in this regard.

To fix the bug:
- Add a step in the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`.
- Use the lowercase version of the table name when checking if it exists in the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and also take into account the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub posts.
