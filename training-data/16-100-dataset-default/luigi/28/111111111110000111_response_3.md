The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is failing the test due to case sensitivity in checking table names.

The relationship between the buggy function and related elements is as follows:
- The `table_exists` function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command.
- The failing test calls the `table_exists` function and checks its return value against expected values.

The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is not returning the expected values.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the case insensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function. The suggestion in the issue is to check `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to check `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and also resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
