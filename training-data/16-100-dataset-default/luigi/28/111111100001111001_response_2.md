The issue with the buggy function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called properly. The function is located in the same file, but is not from the same class. Therefore, it should be called using the class name or through an instance of the class where it's defined.

To fix the bug, we need to change the way `run_hive_cmd` is called. We should either call it using the class name `HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd` or create an instance of `HiveCommandClient` and call it through that instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
