The issue in the buggy function lies in the `else` condition of the `table_exists` function where the `stdout` variable is being checked to return `True` or `False`. The problem seems to be that the logic to check the presence of tables or partitions is not implemented correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to correctly check for the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database. We also need to ensure that the function handles case insensitivity for table names.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(key, val) for key, val in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function checks for the existence of tables or partitions and also handles case insensitivity for table names.

With this correction, the failing test cases should pass as the function now correctly checks for the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database, and handles case insensitivity for table names.
