The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The function checks for the existence of a table by directly comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which might lead to issues when the case of the table name and the output from Hive do not match.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive to handle variations in case. The `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and also address the case insensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue (#896).
