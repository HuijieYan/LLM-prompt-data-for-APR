1. The buggy function "table_exists" is part of the "HiveCommandClient" class in the file "luigi/contrib/hive.py". It checks for the existence of a table in a specified database. The issue identified in the GitHub post is that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when comparing the table name with the stdout. The comparison may fail due to case sensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the function "table_exists" is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. The related function "run_hive_cmd" is used to execute hive commands and retrieve the output. The issue posted on GitHub states that hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, which causes the comparison to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison to be case insensitive
   - Convert the table name to lowercase before comparing

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the "table_exists" function now converts the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
