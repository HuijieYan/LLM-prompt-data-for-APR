The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'else' condition of the 'table_exists' function. 

The bug is likely caused by the 'else' condition returning False regardless of the value of 'stdout'. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test, as it expects the 'table_exists' function to return True when 'stdout' is not empty.

To fix the bug, we need to update the 'else' condition to check if 'table' is in 'stdout' and then return True, else return False.

Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout and table in stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
