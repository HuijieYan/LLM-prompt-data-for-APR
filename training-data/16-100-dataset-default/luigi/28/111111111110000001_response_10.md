Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `table_exists` function, particularly with the condition `if stdout:` and the use of the `partition_spec` function in the `stdout` variable assignment.

Bug's cause: The bug seems to stem from the usage of `stdout` in the condition `if stdout:`. Also, the way `partition_spec` function is used in the `stdout` variable assignment seems to be incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition `if stdout:` to properly check if `stdout` is not an empty string.
2. Check the implementation of the `partition_spec` function to ensure it's used correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {}({});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```
