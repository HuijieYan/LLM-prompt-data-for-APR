The buggy function `table_exists` needs to be fixed based on the failing test cases. The issue seems to be with the comparison of the `stdout` variable. The expected behavior is that the function should return `True` if the `table` is found in the `stdout`, and should also consider case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # Corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition).lower()
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the `stdout` and `table` comparisons are conducted in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase. This should fix the issues seen in the failing test cases.
