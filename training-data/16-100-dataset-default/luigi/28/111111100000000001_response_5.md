The buggy function table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class checks whether a table exists in a given database. The potential error location is in the else block where it calls the run_hive_cmd function with a complex SQL query.

The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL query in the else block of the table_exists function. This formatting issue is likely causing the run_hive_cmd function to fail, which in turn causes the function to return False incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the SQL query in the else block of the table_exists function needs to be reformatted properly. We should also modify the run_hive_cmd function to handle the complex SQL query correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_condition = " and ".join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            cmd = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});""".format(database, table, partition_condition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
