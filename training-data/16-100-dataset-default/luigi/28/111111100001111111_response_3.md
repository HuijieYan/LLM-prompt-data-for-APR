The issue in the buggy function is the case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is not considering the case sensitivity of the table names, which can cause the function to return incorrect results.

The GitHub issue posted by Lin suggests that table names in Hive are case insensitive, and therefore, the function should check stdout against the lower case of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. We need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case sensitivity of table names in Hive and return the expected results for the given input/output variable information and the GitHub issue.
