The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the 'table_exists' function. The error is likely caused by incorrect handling of the 'partition' parameter for the 'table_exists' function, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function needs to correctly handle the 'partition' parameter by calling the 'partition_spec' function with the given partition. Additionally, the 'run_hive_cmd' function needs to be properly utilized within the 'table_exists' function to execute the Hive commands.

Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code:
- The 'partition_spec' function is removed as it was not necessary and was causing confusion with multiple definitions.
- The 'run_hive_cmd' function is properly called with the appropriate Hive commands and parameters.
- The 'partition' parameter is correctly handled to construct the appropriate partition string for the Hive command.
- The 'bool' function is used to convert the value of 'stdout' to a boolean, which simplifies the return statement.

With these changes, the corrected 'table_exists' function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
