The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is used to check if a table exists in the specified database with an optional partition. The failing test is `test_table_exists` in the `contrib/hive_test.py` file which is checking for case insensitivity of table names.

The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison of the table name with the table names retrieved from the output of the `run_hive_cmd` command. The comparison is case sensitive, leading to the test failures.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test and error message clearly indicate that the comparison is failing due to case sensitivity.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive.
2. Convert the table name and the output of the command to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the comparison is made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase. This will ensure that the test for table existence is case insensitive as well.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub for making the table existence check case insensitive.
