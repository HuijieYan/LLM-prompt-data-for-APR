The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly formatting the Hive command to check for the existence of a table with a given partition. The function is not calling the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct parameters in the case where a partition is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the Hive command is formatted and passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function. We also need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly construct and execute the Hive command based on whether or not a partition is provided. This will ensure that the expected test outcomes are achieved and the function operates as intended.
