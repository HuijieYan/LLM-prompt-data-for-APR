1. The buggy function is the `table_exists` function from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. It is being tested by the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions in the `contrib/hive_test.py` file. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is not returning the expected results.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the stdout. It seems that the table name is not being properly matched with the tables present in the database.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The failing tests are clearly showing that the function is not handling table names with different case variations properly. The GitHub issue also confirms this by suggesting that the comparison should be case insensitive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables present in the database.
   - Updating the tests to include table names with different case variations and ensuring they return the expected results.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code includes a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from the database to lowercase for comparison. This should address the case sensitivity issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue. The corrected code fixes the case sensitivity issue and ensures that the `table_exists` function can handle different case variations of table names.
