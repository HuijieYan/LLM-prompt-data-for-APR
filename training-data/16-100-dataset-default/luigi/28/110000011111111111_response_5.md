The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not handling the case insensitivity of table names properly. The function only checks for an exact match of the table name in the stdout, which can cause issues when the table names are in different cases than expected. This causes the failing tests and the GitHub issue #896 is also related to this problem.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner when checking the stdout for the table existence.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout contents to lowercase before comparing.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
