1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a given database and partition. The issue on GitHub states that there is a case sensitivity problem where tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lower case by Hive, causing the test to fail. The suggested fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for table existence, which does not take case sensitivity into account.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive and fails to correctly check for table existence when the table name is in capitalized or mixed case. The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are not directly causing the issue, but are part of the overall behavior of the `table_exists` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name with the lowercase table names in `stdout`.
   - Use the `lower()` function to transform the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the table names in `stdout`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function checks the table name in a case-insensitive manner by using the `lower()` function to transform both the table name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This satisfies the issue posted in the GitHub description.
