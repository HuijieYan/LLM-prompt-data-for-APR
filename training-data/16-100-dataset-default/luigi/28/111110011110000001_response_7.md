1. The buggy function is `table_exists` which is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. It seems to be failing the tests due to incorrect logic when checking if a table exists in the database. The failing test is the `test_table_exists` method which tests the behavior of the `table_exists` method. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `True` but getting `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the conditional statement that checks if `stdout` is not empty. If it is not empty, the function should return `True`, otherwise, it should return `False`.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` method is not correctly checking the output of the command to determine if the table exists or not.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the logic of the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function to ensure that it correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
   - Verifying the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function and how its output should be processed in the `table_exists` method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected code:
- We are using the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- We're also using `==` to directly compare the `stdout` with the table name to determine if it exists or not.
- The `partition_spec` is now correctly obtained from the `self.partition_spec` method and used in the command to check for partitions.

These changes should resolve the issues with the `table_exists` method and make it pass the failing test cases.
