The bug in the `table_exists` function is in how the query is constructed for the `stdout` when `partition` is not None.

The buggy code constructs the query incorrectly by passing the `self.partition_spec(partition)` as a single string. Instead, it should be passed as separate keys and values for the partition.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to construct the query in the correct format when the partition is not None.

Below is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ' and '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code constructs the query in the correct format when a partition is provided and should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
