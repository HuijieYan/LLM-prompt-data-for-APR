The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional statement checking if `stdout` is not empty. The bug seems to be in the logic for checking if the table exists in the specified database. It appears that the bug causing the failing test is due to the incorrect comparison logic.

The bug is in the following lines:
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
The problem here is with the logic of the if statement. The `stdout` value might be a non-empty string even if the table does not exist, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic for checking if the table exists. One possible approach is to modify the bug in the `table_exists` function to handle the case where the table does not exist more accurately. We should also ensure that the correct boolean value is returned based on the conditions met.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```
This updated code returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
