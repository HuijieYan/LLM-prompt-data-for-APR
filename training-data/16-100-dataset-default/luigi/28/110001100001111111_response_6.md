The issue with the buggy function lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout`. It is failing to account for case insensitivity in Hive, which is causing the tests to fail when the table names are in different cases. 

The related GitHub issue also confirms that this is a known problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of `table` and `stdout` to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case and then performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
