1. The buggy function 'table_exists' is checking for the existence of a table in a database. The issue identified on GitHub is that the function is case sensitive, while Hive is case insensitive. This means that if the table name is in uppercase in the function call, but in lowercase in the database, the function will return false.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the 'table' and 'stdout' which is case sensitive.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a). The buggy function 'table_exists' checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner.
   (b). Hive is case insensitive, meaning that table names are not case sensitive.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides information that when checking the existence of a table, the function should check the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout.
   - Check for the existence of the table without considering the case of the table name.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the table name is converted to lowercase before being compared with the stdout. This makes the comparison case insensitive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
