The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands, and it also calls the `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specification. The failing test `test_table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table, both with and without partitions, and the error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected results.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" address the problem of table names being case insensitive in Hive. The issue describes how tables defined with capitalized names can be returned as lower case by Hive, leading to test failures.

The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to case sensitivity. When checking for table existence, the function does not consider the case of the table name. The failing test is not accounting for case differences in the table names, and this is why the assertions are failing.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout in the `table_exists` function. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and address the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub discussion.
