Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely caused by the `table_exists` function not handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests.

Bug Cause:
The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity correctly. The test cases expect the function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, but the function only checks for an exact match, leading to the tests failing when the case of the table name does not match.

Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them to make the check case insensitive.

Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table.lower()} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code will convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread (#896), making the `table_exists` function case insensitive and resolving the failing test cases.
