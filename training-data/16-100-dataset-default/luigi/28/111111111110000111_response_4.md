Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the if-else condition where it checks for the existence of a partition.

Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `table_exists` function to not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This leads to failing test cases where the table name is not matched due to case differences.

Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Update the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The correction involves using the lower() method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This corrected code should successfully pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
