The bug in the provided function is that the logic for checking if the table exists is incorrect. The function always returns True if stdout is not empty, regardless of whether the table actually exists in the database.

To fix this bug, the logic for checking the existence of the table needs to be rewritten. Additionally, the function should handle the case when a partition is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

This corrected code addresses the bug by properly checking if the table exists in the database and also handles the case when a partition is provided. It should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
