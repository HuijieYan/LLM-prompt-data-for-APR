1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to get the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the usage of the `self.partition_spec(partition)` in the `run_hive_cmd` call within the else block. The way the `self.partition_spec` method is being used may lead to unexpected behavior.

3. (a) The buggy function `table_exists` is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
   (b) The `HiveCommandClient` class contains the `table_exists` function and is a subclass of `HiveClient`.
   (c) The `partition_spec` function is being called within the `table_exists` function, and it is defined in the same class as well as outside the class.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `partition_spec` function is correctly implemented and used within the `table_exists` function.
   - Check if the arguments passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function are valid.
   - Verify that the condition for checking the output of `run_hive_cmd` is appropriate.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, spec))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the `partition_spec` function is called directly within the `table_exists` function to get the partition specification, and then the `run_hive_cmd` is called with the correct parameters. The output is then checked using the `bool` function to return `True` or `False` as needed.
