Looking at the buggy function `table_exists`, it seems to have a potential error in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the provided `table` parameter. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive query and then checks if the `table` exists in the resulting `stdout`. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, which can lead to incorrect results if the table name's case does not match.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" specifically addresses this problem and suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. The proposed fix suggests using `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout` or `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to address the case sensitivity issue.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function now compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
