The potential error in the buggy function "table_exists" lies in how it compares the table name with the output of the hive command. The issue on GitHub suggests that the table names are sometimes defined in capitalized letters, whereas hive is case-insensitive and returns them as lower case. This causes the comparison to fail. The issue suggests checking the stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function "table_exists" should be updated to compare the table name in lower case with the output of the hive command. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Here is the corrected code for the "table_exists" function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code uses lower() to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison, thereby fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
