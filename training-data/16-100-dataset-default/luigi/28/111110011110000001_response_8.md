1. The problematic function in the HiveCommandClient class is table_exists. The failing test is testing the behavior of this function. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected results, leading to an AssertionError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement using the run_hive_cmd function to check if a table exists.

3. (a) The buggy function, table_exists, is using run_hive_cmd to run a Hive query to check if a table exists in the specified database. The issue seems to be with the logic of parsing the output of the run_hive_cmd function and returning the correct result.
   (b) The HiveCommandClient class contains the table_exists function, which is the source of the bug. It also has a related function, partition_spec, which is used within the table_exists function.
   (c) The failing test is calling the table_exists function with different inputs and checking if the expected results are returned. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected results, leading to assertion errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic of the table_exists function to ensure it properly handles the output of the run_hive_cmd function.
   - Debugging the function to understand how it processes the output of the Hive query and returns the results.
   - Checking if the parameters provided to the run_hive_cmd function are correct and if the query being executed is appropriate for checking the existence of a table.

5. Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, ','.join('{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code incorporates proper formatting of the Hive queries and improved handling of the output to ensure the correct table existence check. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
