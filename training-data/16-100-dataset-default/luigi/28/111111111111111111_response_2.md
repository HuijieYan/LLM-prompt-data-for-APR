The issue with the buggy function stems from the fact that the comparison for table existence is case sensitive, which leads to failures in the test cases if the table name's case does not match. The `table_exists` function only checks for an exact match of the table name returned in the `stdout`, which causes issues when the case of the table name is different.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the names returned in the `stdout` should be made case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, which addresses the issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This code updates the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, making it case insensitive. This change ensures that the comparison between the table name and the names returned in the `stdout` is not affected by case discrepancies. 

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
