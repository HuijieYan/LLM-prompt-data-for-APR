1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. The failing test is testing the `table_exists` function with different scenarios and checking for the expected output.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the logic inside the else statement, which is responsible for checking the existence of a table with a specific partition.

3. The buggy function is trying to run a hive command to check if a table exists with a specific partition. The failing test is testing the function with different cases, and the error message is indicating that the function is returning unexpected results, causing the test cases to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic inside the else statement to ensure that the hive command is constructed and executed correctly for checking the table existence with a specific partition.
   - Check if the `partition_spec` function is being called with the correct arguments and is returning the expected partition specification.

5. Corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the logic inside the `else` statement has been modified to construct the hive command using the `partition` argument and the `run_hive_cmd` function to check the existence of the table with the specific partition. By returning `bool(stdout)`, we ensure that the function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists with the given partition. This corrected code should pass the failing test cases.
