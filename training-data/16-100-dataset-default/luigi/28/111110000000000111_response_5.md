1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a class that uses `hive` invocations to find information. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and its detailed description highlight that tables are sometimes defined with capitalized names, but hive is case insensitive and returns them as lower case, leading to test failures. The issue proposes to fix this by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the comparison of `table` with `stdout`, as it does not account for case sensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the input `table` and `stdout`, without considering case sensitivity. The GitHub Issue information further elaborates on this issue, indicating that tables with capitalized names are returned in lower case, causing test failures.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before comparison.
   - Adding a check to ensure that the function handles case sensitivity appropriately based on the nature of the data.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code modifies the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before comparison, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the case sensitivity issue and align with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.
