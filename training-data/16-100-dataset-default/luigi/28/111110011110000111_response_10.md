The buggy function table_exists in the HiveCommandClient class is designed to check for the existence of a table in a given database. The function uses run_hive_cmd to execute a Hive query and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the run_hive_cmd. The test_table_exists and test_apacheclient_table_exists are failing because the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output, leading to false assertions.

The GitHub issue #896 further clarifies that the table_exists function should be case insensitive due to Hive being case insensitive. This means that the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output.

To fix this bug, the table_exists function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before checking its existence in the output of run_hive_cmd. This modification should make the function case insensitive regarding table names and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output, ensuring that the function is case insensitive. This change should address the failing tests and satisfy the GitHub issue.
