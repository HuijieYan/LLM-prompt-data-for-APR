The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. The function is supposed to call the `run_hive_cmd` method from the same class, but it's currently calling a global function with the same name. Additionally, the condition to check table existence is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` should be called using `self.run_hive_cmd` and the condition to check table existence should be updated.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code should fix the issue and satisfy the failing tests as well as the expected input/output variable information.
