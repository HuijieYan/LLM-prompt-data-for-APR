The buggy function `table_exists` is expected to check whether a table exists in a given Hive database. 

The issue with the buggy function lies in the `else` block, where it attempts to run a Hive command to show partitions in a specific table. The function uses an incorrect format to construct the Hive command, and it calls a non-existent function `self.partition_spec(partition)` to generate the partition specification.

The failing test indicates that the function is not returning the correct value for `table_exists`. The expected behavior is that the function should return `True` if a table exists, and `False` otherwise.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the Hive command being executed and ensure that the `partition_spec` function is called correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key,value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {}.{} partition ({})'.format(database, table, table, partition_condition))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected, which is to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.
