1. The buggy function is checking if a table exists in a database with an optional partition. It uses the run_hive_cmd() function to run Hive commands and returns True if the table/partition exists, otherwise False.

2. The potential error location is the usage of run_hive_cmd() function and the condition of checking the stdout variable.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition for checking table existence is not properly handled for both cases (with or without partition).

4. To fix the bug, we can use try-except blocks to handle the potential exceptions that may occur in the run_hive_cmd() function. Additionally, we should also check the stdout variable properly and handle the condition for table existence with and without partition.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        try:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            return False
    else:
        try:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")
            return stdout is not None
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            return False
```
