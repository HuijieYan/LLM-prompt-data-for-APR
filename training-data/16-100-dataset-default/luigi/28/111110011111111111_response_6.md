The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the test case for table names with different cases to fail.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case using the `lower()` method, and then compare them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will be case insensitive and should pass the failing tests. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub, as it makes the table exists check case insensitive.

This corrected code satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
