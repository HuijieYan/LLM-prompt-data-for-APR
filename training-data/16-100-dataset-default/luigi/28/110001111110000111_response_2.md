The bug is located in the table_exists function in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file. The issue arises from the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing table names.

The failing test is trying to check if the table name 'mytable' exists, and then it also checks if the function is case insensitive by using 'MyTable', which should also return True.

The GitHub issue points out that tables are sometimes defined with capitalized names, but Hive is case insensitive and will return table names as lowercase. This is likely causing the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to compare table names in a case insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will compare table names in a case insensitive manner and should pass the failing test. Additionally, this fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and makes the table_exists function case insensitive. This should resolve the problem and satisfy the request made in the GitHub issue.
