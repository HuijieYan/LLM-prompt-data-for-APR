The issue in the `table_exists` function is that the conditional checks for the presence of the table within the output (`stdout`) using `table in stdout`. However, this check fails in cases where the table name is part of another word in the output.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to perform a more precise check for the existence of the table in the output. Additionally, for the case when a partition is specified, we need to properly use the `self.partition_spec` function to construct the partition string.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now split the `stdout` on newline characters for the first conditional, and for the second conditional, it will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

This should fix the issue for all the failing test cases mentioned.
