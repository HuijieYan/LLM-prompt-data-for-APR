The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to determine whether a given table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and parse the output to determine the existence of the table. The bug seems to be in the conditional statements where it checks whether the table exists or not. The failing test is indicating that the function is returning incorrect results for table existence.

The most likely cause of the bug is the conditional check in the `table_exists` function. The conditional checks are not handling the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly and are returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` and determine the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        partition_string = ', '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string});")

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine the existence of the table and returns the correct boolean value based on the result. This should ensure that the `table_exists` function passes the failing test.
