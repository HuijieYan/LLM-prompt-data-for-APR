The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is intended to check if a table exists in a given database and potentially with a given partition. The failing test cases (both `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`) indicate that the function is not returning the correct result, as the assertions for `self.assertTrue(returned)` are failing.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement where the stdout is checked and the result is returned. It seems that the logic for checking the stdout and returning the result is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases. 

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the case when a partition is provided. The call to `run_hive_cmd` with the partition query is likely not being processed correctly, leading to the incorrect result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking the logic for constructing the query with the partition and ensuring it is formed correctly.
2. Debugging the `run_hive_cmd` function to see if it is receiving the partition query correctly and returning the expected output.
3. Modifying the conditional statement to correctly handle the case when a partition is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_query = " AND ".join(["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_query))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the partition query is constructed correctly, and the result is directly returned based on the presence of stdout. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
