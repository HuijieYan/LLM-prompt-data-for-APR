Issues with the buggy function:
- The function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is using `run_hive_cmd` without referencing the module it's from, which may result in NameError.
- The function is also calling `self.partition_spec` without reference to the correct module, which may result in a similar NameError.

Cause of the bug:
- The cause of the bug is the missing reference to the external functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec`. This results in an NameError causing the function to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Import the module in which the functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are defined.
- Ensure that the function references these external functions correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py
import luigi.contrib.hive

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(luigi.contrib.hive.HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """    

    # this is the fixed function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```
