The bug in the provided function is caused by the way it handles the `stdout` variable and compares it to the expected table value. In the `table_exists` function, when the `partition` parameter is None, the function runs a command and expects the table name to be in the output. When the `partition` parameter is not None, it runs a different command and expects a True or False return based on the output.

The issue is that the function does not handle the output correctly. In the first case, the function should check if the table name is in the `stdout` output, not just if it exists. In the second case, the function should return True if there is any output in `stdout`, not just if the output is non-empty.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the `stdout` correctly and compare it to the expected table name.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # return True if there is any output
```

With this modification, the function should now handle the `stdout` correctly and return the expected values. This corrected code should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
