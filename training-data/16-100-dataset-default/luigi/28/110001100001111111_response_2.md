The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when comparing the table name with the output from Hive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function will now convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing, ensuring that case sensitivity issues are resolved.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" provides a detailed description of the bug and the proposed fix. The suggestion in the issue to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues aligns with the approach we have taken to fix the bug.

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
