The buggy function table_exists is a method of a class (self) that checks if a table exists in a given database. The implementation uses run_hive_cmd to execute a Hive command and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The failing test is testing the table_exists method by mocking the run_hive_cmd and checking for the expected behavior. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the method is not returning the expected result.

The GitHub issue suggests that the table_exists method should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This is because Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. If the table name is not converted to lowercase before comparison, the comparison may fail due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will accurately determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code ensures that the table name is converted to lowercase before comparison, making the method case insensitive. This will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
