The buggy function is trying to determine if a table or partition exists in a database using Hive commands. The issue seems to be with the comparison of the expected and actual values in the return statement.

The potential error location is in the comparison of the stdout variable with the expected values. The comparison is not being handled correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison logic in the return statement is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the return statements to explicitly check for the existence of the table or partition based on the stdout variable.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided. It explicitly checks for the existence of the table or partition based on the stdout variable and returns a boolean value accordingly.
