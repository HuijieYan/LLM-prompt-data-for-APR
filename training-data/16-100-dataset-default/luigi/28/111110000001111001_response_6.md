The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the second `stdout` variable when `partition` is not None. The `run_hive_cmd` call inside the `else` branch is not correctly formatted and is missing a semicolon at the end of the command.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` call inside the `else` branch should be formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases.
