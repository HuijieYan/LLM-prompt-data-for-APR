The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug because it does not handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The test cases are failing due to the case sensitivity issue. The expected values of the variables at the function's return are not being met, causing the tests to fail.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names. The failing tests are specifically checking for case insensitivity, and the function is not meeting those requirements.

The proposed fix for this bug is to modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and fix the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case sensitivity of table names in a case-insensitive manner, allowing the tests to pass.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" also highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, providing additional context to the bug and supporting the proposed fix.
