The issue with the buggy function is that it is not performing case-insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This is causing the test cases to fail when running with different cases for the table names.

The failing test and error message clearly indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly. The expected and actual input/output variable information also shows discrepancies in the returned values, indicating that the function is not returning the expected results.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

To fix the bug, the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the table's existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it fixes the issue reported in the GitHub post by making the table_exists function case insensitive.
