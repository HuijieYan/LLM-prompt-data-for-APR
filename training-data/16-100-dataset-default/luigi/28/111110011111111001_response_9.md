The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable and the condition for checking its value.

From the failing test cases, it appears that the function is not correctly checking the existence of the table in the database and is returning the wrong values.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists. In the current implementation, the `stdout` is being checked for truthiness, which may not be the correct approach.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition for checking the existence of the table in the `table_exists` function. We should check if the table name is in the `stdout` variable, rather than just checking for its truthiness.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # This line checks if stdout is not empty and returns True, otherwise False
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in the database and return the expected results. It should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
