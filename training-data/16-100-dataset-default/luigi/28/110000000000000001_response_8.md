1. The function is intended to check if a table exists in a database, and if a partition is specified, it also checks if the partition exists. However, the function is not functioning as expected.

2. The potential error location is in the second part of the function where it checks for partitions.

3. The bug's cause is that the 'run_hive_cmd' function is not being used properly, and the string formatting in the second part of the function is incorrect.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'run_hive_cmd' function is called correctly and that the string formatting is done properly to construct the Hive commands.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_cmd)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we have properly constructed the Hive command for checking the partitions and used the 'run_hive_cmd' function with the correct command. We also used string formatting to construct the partition command in a more readable and maintainable way.
