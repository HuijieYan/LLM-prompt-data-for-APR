The potential error in the buggy function is the use of "show tables" and "show partitions" commands in Hive. These commands are case-sensitive, which causes the function to fail when dealing with table names in different cases.

The bug cause is the incorrect comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive commands. The function does not take into account the case-insensitivity of table names in Hive.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table names and the output of the Hive commands to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))

        return any(p.lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).lower() for p in stdout.split())

```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
