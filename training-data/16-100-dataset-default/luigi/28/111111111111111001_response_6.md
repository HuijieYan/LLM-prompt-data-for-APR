The issue in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the different cases of input correctly. In the failing test, it is seen that the function is expected to return `True` for the case when the table exists, and `False` when it doesn't.

The problem seems to be occurring in the second conditional block where the function is trying to get the partition information. It should return `True` if the stdout is not empty, and `False` if it is empty. However, it is currently returning `True` regardless.

To fix this, we need to modify the second conditional block to correctly handle the cases whether the stdout is empty or not.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Check if the `stdout` is not empty in the second conditional block, return `True` if so.
2. If `stdout` is empty, return `False`.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, False if it is empty
```

This should now address the issue and the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
