The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. The comparison is case sensitive, which causes the function to fail when searching for tables with uppercase letters in the name.

The cause of the bug is that the table name comparison is not case insensitive, and the function fails to account for this, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code makes the comparison of the table name and the stdout case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. It addresses the problem of failing to identify tables with uppercase letters in their names.
