The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The function is not accounting for the case insensitivity of table names in Hive, which causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue #896.
