Upon analysis, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The failing test is expecting the function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, but the function is not currently implemented to handle case insensitivity.

The source of the bug lies in the fact that the function directly checks if the table name is present in the stdout without considering the case. This results in the function returning incorrect results in case the table name's case does not match.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function can be modified to check against the lowercase version of both the table name and the stdout to ensure case insensitivity.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} 
                            partition (%s)""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the strings in the stdout, making the table existence check case insensitive. This change should address the failing tests and also resolve the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
