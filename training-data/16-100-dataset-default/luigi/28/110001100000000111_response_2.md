1. The buggy function "table_exists" is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue on GitHub suggests that sometimes tables may be defined with capitalized names, but Hive is case insensitive and will return them as lowercase names. This causes the test to fail when checking for an existing table with a capitalized name.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. The comparison does not take into account case sensitivity, leading to potential failures when checking for table existence.

3. The bug is caused by the buggy function "table_exists" not accounting for case sensitivity in Hive table names. The related function "run_hive_cmd" is used to run Hive commands and return the output. The GitHub issue information confirms that the problem arises when checking for existing tables with capitalized names, as Hive returns them in lowercase. The suggested fix on GitHub is to check the output against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command to account for case insensitivity.
   - Modify the comparison logic to handle case insensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive.
   - Update the function to use case-insensitive comparison methods or functions provided by the Hive library.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function "table_exists":

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        # Convert table name to lowercase for case insensitive comparison
        if stdout:
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        # Convert table name to lowercase for case insensitive comparison
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code converts the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command, addressing the case sensitivity issue. This fix aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue.
