The buggy function is a method `table_exists` within a class `contrib.hive`. The method takes in the table name, database name, and partition as input parameters and checks whether the given table exists in the specified database.

The failing test `test_table_exists` is checking the behavior of the `table_exists` method. The error message indicates that the test is failing when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

The corresponding GitHub issue suggests that the method `table_exists` should be case-insensitive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase and the test is failing when checking for table existence with capitalized names.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` method is the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. It seems that the method is not handling case-insensitivity properly.

The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` method is not performing a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. As a result, the test is failing when checking for table existence with capitalized names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` method will perform a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The corrected code satisfies the following:
- It will pass the failing test by performing a case-insensitive comparison.
- It successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to case-insensitivity when checking for table existence.
