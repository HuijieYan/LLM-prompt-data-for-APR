1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is used to find information using `hive` invocations. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" suggests that the table existence check should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lowercase even if they are defined with capital letters. The issue proposes to fix this by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the `stdout`. Since Hive returns table names in lowercase, the comparison using the original table name may yield incorrect results.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function `table_exists` currently checks for the presence of a table in the database using a case-sensitive comparison.
   (b). The `HiveCommandClient` class is used to interact with Hive using `hive` invocations.
   (c). The GitHub issue information highlights the case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive, and proposes a fix to make the comparison case insensitive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison.
   - Use the lowercase version of the table name for comparison with the `stdout` to account for case insensitivity in Hive.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This update addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive in accordance with Hive's behavior.
