1. The buggy function is a method to check if a table exists in a database and optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and check if the table/partition exists.

2. The potential error lies in the second part of the function where it checks for partition existence. The `run_hive_cmd` command is not correctly formatted and doesn't include the `show tables` command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` in the second part should also use the `show tables` command to check for table existence within a specific partition.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct Hive commands are executed both in the case of checking for table existence and partition existence.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```
In the corrected code, the correct Hive commands are used to check for table existence and partition existence. The `show tables` command is used with the `like` clause for table existence, and the `show tables` command with the `partition` clause is used for partition existence. The `return` statement is also fixed to return the result of the check.
