The potential error in the buggy function is within the conditional statements where it checks if the table exists in the database. The issue is related to case sensitivity: the function only checks for an exact match, but Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lower case, which may cause the function to incorrectly determine the table's existence.

The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. This function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table exists in a given database and partition.

The GitHub issue "hive table_exists should be case insensitive" identifies that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case, causing the function to fail. The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner by comparing with the lower case version of the table name.

Below is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, the `table_exists` function checks if the lower case version of the table name exists in the lower case version of the `stdout`. This ensures that the function is case insensitive and resolves the issue described in the GitHub post.
