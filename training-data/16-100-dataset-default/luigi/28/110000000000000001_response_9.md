1. The buggy function is checking for the existence of a table in a database. It takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'else' block where it's trying to check if the stdout is not empty.

3. The cause of the bug is that the 'else' block is not properly handling the 'stdout' variable. It is not checking if the 'stdout' variable contains the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the 'else' block properly handles the 'stdout' variable and checks if it contains the expected output.
   - Check for any syntax errors in the 'run_hive_cmd' function, which might be causing the issue.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the formatting of the 'else' block, added the 'partition_cmd' variable to correctly format the partition, and used `bool(stdout)` to check if stdout contains any data. We have also used proper string formatting to avoid any syntax errors.
