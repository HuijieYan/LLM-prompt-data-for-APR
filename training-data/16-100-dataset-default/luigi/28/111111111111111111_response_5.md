The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the way it checks for the existence of a table. The function is case-sensitive when checking the table name in the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which causes the test to fail if the case doesn't match.

The related GitHub issue (#896) also mentions that the table_exists function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout response to lowercase before checking for the table's existence.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... (other functions)

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will be case insensitive and will pass all of the failing test cases provided. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as expected.
