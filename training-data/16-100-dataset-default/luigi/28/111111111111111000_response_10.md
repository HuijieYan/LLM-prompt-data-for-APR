The issue with the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly, resulting in incorrect output. The `run_hive_cmd` function should be called using the `self` reference as it is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The reference to `run_hive_cmd` must be accessed as `self.run_hive_cmd` to properly invoke the method.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

By making this change, the `run_hive_cmd` function will be correctly invoked as a method of the class, and the output from the function should now match the expected values for all the test cases.
