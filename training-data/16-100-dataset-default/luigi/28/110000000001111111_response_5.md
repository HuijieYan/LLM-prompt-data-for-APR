The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. This means that if a table is defined with capitalized names, the function will fail to recognize it. The GitHub issue suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function can accurately determine if a table exists regardless of the case in which it's defined in the database.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now be able to correctly identify the existence of a table in a case insensitive manner.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" suggests the same approach and aims to address this bug.
