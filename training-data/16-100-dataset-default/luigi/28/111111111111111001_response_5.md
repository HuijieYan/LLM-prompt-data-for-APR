Based on the provided information, the bug is likely located in the 'table_exists' function of the 'HiveCommandClient' class in the 'luigi/contrib/hive.py' file. The issue seems to stem from the conditional check when a partition is provided as an input.

The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing test cases. The failing test cases are checking the function's behavior with different input values and asserting against the expected results, which are not being met due to the bug in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the 'stdout' variable in the 'table_exists' function, specifically when a partition is provided. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected function will address the conditional check when a partition is provided and should now pass the failing test cases. The function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
