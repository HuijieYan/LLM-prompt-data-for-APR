The issue with the buggy function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function only checks if the table name is present in the stdout, without considering the case of the table name.

The expected input and output variable information shows that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the table existence. The GitHub issue also confirms that this is a known issue and suggests a solution by checking the stdout against the lower case version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the lower case version of the table name in the stdout to make it case insensitive.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function checks for the lower case version of the table name in the stdout, making the table existence check case insensitive. This solution aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue.
