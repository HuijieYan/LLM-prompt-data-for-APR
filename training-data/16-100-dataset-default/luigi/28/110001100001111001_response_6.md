The bug in the code seems to be related to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called. The function `run_hive_cmd` is not defined within the current class, so it needs to be accessed using the correct import statement or reference.

The potential error location is in the calls to the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `table_exists` function. The code is currently calling `run_hive_cmd` as if it were a method of the current class, which it is not.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. We also need to properly handle the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns "OK\nmytable" for the table check. It seems that the code currently only looks for an exact match, so we need to adjust the logic to handle the case when the table name is contained within the returned value.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected code
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
