The bug in the `table_exists` function is that when the `partition` parameter is not None, it calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with incorrect formatting, leading to incorrect results.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is called within the `table_exists` function, and based on the expected output, it seems to be working correctly.

The class `HiveCommandClient` contains the `table_exists` function, and it seems to be related to the issue at hand.

The buggy function is not correctly handling the partition parameter when it is not None, leading to incorrect formatting of the command passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statement that handles the partition parameter to format the command correctly before passing it to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string})")

        return bool(stdout)
```
