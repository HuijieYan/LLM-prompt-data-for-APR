The issue with the `table_exists` function seems to be with the logic used to check the existence of a table. In the first branch of the if-else statement, the function checks for the existence of the table using a simple string comparison. However, in the second branch, the logic for checking the existence of the table with a specific partition seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the second branch of the if-else statement. We need to compare the specific partition with the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists with that partition.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to construct the full command to show partitions and then check if the specific partition exists in the `stdout` variable. We can compare each line of the `stdout` with the partition string constructed from the `self.partition_spec` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        full_cmd = f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});'
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(full_cmd)
        
        return partition_str in stdout
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected results.
