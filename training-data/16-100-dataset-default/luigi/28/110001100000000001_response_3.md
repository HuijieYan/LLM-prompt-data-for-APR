1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database, with the option to specify a partition. It makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to generate partition specifications.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `run_hive_cmd` calls, where the Hive commands are executed. There might be issues with the construction of the Hive commands and the handling of the output.
3. The bug's cause is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without the appropriate arguments, and the stdout is not being handled correctly in the conditionals.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the arguments being passed to `run_hive_cmd` and ensuring they are constructed properly for the Hive commands.
   - Properly handling the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` calls in the conditionals to determine if the table or partition exists.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        partition_spec_str = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k,v) for k,v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code:
- The `run_hive_cmd` calls are constructed properly with the necessary arguments for the Hive commands.
- The stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` calls is properly handled in the conditionals to determine if the table or partition exists.
