The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking the table name against the output from the hive command. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence.

The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a specified database. It takes input parameters such as `table`, `database`, and `partition`. The function then runs a hive command to check for the existence of the table in the given database.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable value show that the function does not handle case insensitivity, causing it to fail in cases where the table name has a different case in the hive command output.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights this problem, suggesting that tables can be defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase, causing issues when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the table name and its lowercase version to the stdout of the hive command to correctly identify the table's existence regardless of case.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout output from the hive command, the function becomes case insensitive and will return correct results when checking for table existence.

This code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
