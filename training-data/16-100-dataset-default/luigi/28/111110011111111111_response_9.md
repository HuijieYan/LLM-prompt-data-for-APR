The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it performs a case-sensitive check for the existence of the table, which leads to the test failures. The function only checks if the table name exactly matches the output from the command run on the Hive, and does not account for case differences.

To resolve the bug, the `table_exists` function should perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the Hive, which should resolve the test failures.

This change will also resolve the GitHub issue as it addresses the need for case-insensitive table existence checks.

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
