The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command. The function does not account for the case difference between the table name and the names returned by hive, which causes the comparison to fail in certain cases.

To fix this bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase before making the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now compares the lowercase versions of the table name and the hive output, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This change fulfills the expected input/output variable information provided in the test cases.

Additionally, this fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussions, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and its detailed description also support this approach.
