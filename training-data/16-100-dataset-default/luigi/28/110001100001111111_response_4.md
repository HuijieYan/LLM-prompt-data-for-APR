The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking the table name against the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can cause tests to fail when the table names are in different cases than expected. 

The `table_exists` function is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to retrieve the table names and then checks if the provided table name exists in the output. The bug here is that the comparison is case-sensitive, while Hive is case-insensitive when it comes to table names. This causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing the table names.

To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` needs to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, allowing it to return correct results regardless of the case of the table name.

The GitHub issue can be addressed by referencing this bug and proposing the code change. The issue title could be "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and the detailed description would mention that the comparison between table names and the `run_hive_cmd` output needs to be made case-insensitive to avoid issues with table name casing.
