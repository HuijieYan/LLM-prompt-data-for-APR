The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking whether a table exists in the database. The actual and expected values of the `stdout` variable indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly. This is also confirmed by the GitHub issue, which suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return stdout and table in stdout`, where the function is checking if the `table` is in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, this correction also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report, as the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
