The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition for checking if `stdout` contains a certain string. It seems that the condition is not handling the case where the string is contained within a larger string, leading to a false negative result.

The bug's cause is that the condition `table in stdout` is not handling the case where the table name is part of a larger string, resulting in the function returning False even when the table exists in the database.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if the table name is part of the stdout string using the `in` keyword. This will handle cases where the table name is included in a larger string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

This corrected code modifies the condition to check if `stdout` is not empty, which covers cases where the table name appears within a larger string. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
