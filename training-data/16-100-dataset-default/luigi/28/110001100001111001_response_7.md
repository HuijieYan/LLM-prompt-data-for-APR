The bug in the given function is the incorrect use of `partition_spec` method. The function is calling `self.partition_spec(partition)` which is not correct because `partition_spec` is not a method of the class and should instead be called as `partition_spec(partition)`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly call the `partition_spec` method from the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` and have the correct signature for the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
