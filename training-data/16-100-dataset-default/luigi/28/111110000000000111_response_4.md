1. The buggy function 'table_exists' is a method of the class HiveCommandClient, which is used for finding information using 'hive' invocations. The function takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition. The GitHub issue indicates that the table_exists function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the 'stdout' returned from the hive command. The comparison is not case insensitive, which can lead to issues with finding tables that have different cases in the database.

3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the 'stdout' is case sensitive. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue, which suggests that the comparison should be made case insensitive to avoid issues with table names that are defined in capitalized or lower case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison between the table name and stdout to be case insensitive.
   - Using the lower() method to convert the table name and the 'stdout' to lowercase before comparison.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function 'table_exists' that addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

In the corrected code, the comparison between the table name and 'stdout' is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the lower() method before the comparison. This change ensures that the table_exists function is now case insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub.
