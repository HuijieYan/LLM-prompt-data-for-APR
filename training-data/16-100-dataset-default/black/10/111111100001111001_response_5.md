The issue identified in the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it does not handle the last remaining characters in the prefix variable correctly. In the for loop, after the loop has completed iterating over all characters in the prefix, the function is not considering the last remaining characters as part of the current_line or appending it to the lines list.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to handle the last remaining characters in the prefix variable even after the for loop has completed.

Below is the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected function now handles the last remaining characters in the prefix variable even after the for loop has completed iterating over all characters. It appends the remaining characters to the current_line and then joins them with the lines list before returning. This ensures that the function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
