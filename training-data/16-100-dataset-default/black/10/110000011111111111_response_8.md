The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is supposed to consume a prefix and return the consumed lines and the remaining line. However, it seems that the function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly, especially after a dedent.

The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` tries to compare the output of the function with the expected content, and the comparison fails for the `contents_tab` input, as the actual output is different from the expected one.

Looking at the actual input/output variable value information, it seems that there are discrepancies in the behavior of the function related to handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This is also in line with the GitHub issue title and description, which highlights the specific issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. It seems that the issue is likely related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the calculation of `current_column`. The condition for `wait_for_nl` and the indentation logic should be adjusted to properly handle comments and their indentation.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to specifically handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This might involve adjusting the conditions for `wait_for_nl` and the logic for updating `current_column` based on different types of characters encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
    return '\n'.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent and pass the failing test case. It should also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
