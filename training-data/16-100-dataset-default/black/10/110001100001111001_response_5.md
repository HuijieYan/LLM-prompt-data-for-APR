The bug in the function is likely to be located in the logic for determining when to return the result. The current implementation does not handle cases where the current column has not reached the target column, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for handling the wait_for_nl variable and properly updating the current_column.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. The adjustments made ensure that the function handles edge cases and correctly determines when to return the result.
