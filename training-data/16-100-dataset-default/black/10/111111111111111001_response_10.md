The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be with the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. When encountering a tab character, the function is incorrectly updating `current_column` with 4 instead of adding to the existing value.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for handling tab characters and incrementing `current_column` based on the existing value.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # modify the logic for handling tab characters
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should fix the issue by properly handling tab characters and correctly updating the `current_column` variable.

This updated logic aligns with the expected values and types for the given failing test cases. This approach should ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
