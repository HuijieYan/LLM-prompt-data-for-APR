The bug in the provided function is that when the variable `wait_for_nl` is set to False, the check for `wait_for_nl` is still done, leading to the wrong behavior in the function. This causes the function to not behave as expected and makes the unit tests fail.

To fix this bug, we should remove the check for `wait_for_nl` when it is set to False in the function. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly for all cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code ensures that the function processes the input variables as expected and returns the correct output by taking into account the values and types of the variables provided for the failing test cases.
