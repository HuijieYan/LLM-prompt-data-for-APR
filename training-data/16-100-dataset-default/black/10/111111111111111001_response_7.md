The potential error location within the problematic function is to do with the logic for when to handle new lines and how to update current_column.

The issue is with the logic for identifying the expected column for the prefix. It fails to properly calculate the position of a line. It should count tabs as 4 spaces and spaces count as 1. 

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling tabs and spaces to correctly calculate the position of each character in the prefix.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
