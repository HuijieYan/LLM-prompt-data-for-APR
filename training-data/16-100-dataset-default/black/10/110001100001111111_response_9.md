The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming and returning a prefix string according to the given column, by consuming spaces, tabs, and newlines as necessary. The issue detailed in the GitHub report suggests that the function is incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

Upon analyzing the function and the reported issue, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of tab characters and the calculation of the current column as the prefix is being processed.

The actual inputs and outputs show that the function is not correctly handling tab characters regarding the indentation level and potentially interfering with the expected output.

The function logic should properly handle tabs and calculate the current column level in a way that is consistent with the expected behavior of the python interpreter.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tabs and calculate the current column level. This can be achieved by ensuring that the logic for handling tabs is consistent with the Python interpreter's logic for tab indentation.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now properly handles tab characters and calculates the current column level in a way that is consistent with the expected behavior of the Python interpreter. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
