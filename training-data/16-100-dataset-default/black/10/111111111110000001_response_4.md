Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to be occurring when the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is unable to correctly handle indentation and comments in the input text.

Bug's cause:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation and comments in the input text. This is causing the failing test to produce an incorrect result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly handle the indentation and comments in the input text.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the indentation level and processes comments within the text.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the provided changes, the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now appropriately handle indentation and comments, resolving the failing test scenario.
