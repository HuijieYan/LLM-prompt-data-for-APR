The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. In several cases, it does not seem to be toggled as expected, leading to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the logic for correctly determining when a line has been partially consumed is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Toggling the `wait_for_nl` flag when a new line character is encountered.
2. Updating the logic to correctly identify when a line has been partially consumed so the remaining characters can be returned.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if not wait_for_nl:  # Only count space and tabs if not waiting for a new line
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
