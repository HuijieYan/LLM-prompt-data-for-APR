This function seems to be intended to consume from the prefix until reaching a certain column, and return the consumed part and the remaining prefix. However, the current implementation does not handle all cases correctly.

The actual output is different from the expected output in several cases, which means that the function has issues with handling different input scenarios and doesn't produce the correct results.

The potential error location is the condition for checking if the current character is a newline character. It should be moved outside of the if block that checks for `wait_for_nl`. 

The cause of the bug is that the variable `wait_for_nl` is not being handled properly and the new lines are not being added to the `lines` list, causing discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the `lines` list is updated correctly and that the `wait_for_nl` flag is handled as expected. Additionally, the condition for checking the newline character should be moved outside the if block that checks for `wait_for_nl`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With this corrected code, the function takes into account the expected input/output variable information provided and should behave as intended in all cases.
