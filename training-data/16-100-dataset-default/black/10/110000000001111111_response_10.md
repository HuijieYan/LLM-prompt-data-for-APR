The problem with the buggy function lies in the section where it checks for tab and space characters, and updates the current_column and wait_for_nl variables. The function is not correctly handling the tab character, which causes the incorrect indentation.

The expected input/output variable information and the Github issue both highlight the incorrect handling of tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the current_column value accordingly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comment indentation is preserved after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust current_column for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and preserve the comment indentation after a dedent. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
