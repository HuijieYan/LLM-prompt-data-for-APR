The potential error location within the buggy function is in the logic concerning the indentation level and the handling of new lines.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string until a certain column number is reached. It does this by iterating through each character in the prefix, keeping track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line. However, the logic for handling indentation levels and new lines is incorrect, causing the function to return incorrect results.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects the function to correctly handle indentation for comments, but it fails due to incorrect handling of tabs and spaces.

The GitHub issue mentions that the problem occurs specifically when the input file uses tabs, indicating that the issue is related to the handling of indentation levels.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle indentation levels and new lines. Specifically, pay attention to how tabs and spaces are counted as indentation, and how new lines are handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        else:
            if not wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should handle both tabs and spaces for indentation, and correctly handle new lines. It should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
