The issue with the buggy function is that it's not correctly handling indentation when there are spaces and tabs. It's not considering the tab character as equivalent to four spaces. This is causing the incorrect handling of indentation in some cases.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to correctly handle indentation when there are both spaces and tabs.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            to_next_tab_stop = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * to_next_tab_stop
            current_column += to_next_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now correctly handle both spaces and tabs for indentation, and it should pass the failing test.
