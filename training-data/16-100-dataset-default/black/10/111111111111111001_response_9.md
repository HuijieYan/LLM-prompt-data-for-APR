The issue with the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it doesn't handle the case where the line is finished before reaching the specified column. Additionally, there are issues with how the current line is being handled and how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being used.

The correct approach to fixing this bug is as follows:
1. Initialize the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False`.
2. For each character in the `prefix`, check if it's a space, tab, or newline, and update the `current_column` accordingly.
3. If the `wait_for_nl` flag is `True`, then check if the character is a newline. If it is, check if the `current_line` is non-empty and the `current_column` is less than the specified column. If both conditions are met, return the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.
4. If the character is a tab or space, update the `current_column` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `Driver` class and the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the given cases and should also pass the failing test.
