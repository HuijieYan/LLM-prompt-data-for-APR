The issue in the given function is that it doesn't properly handle the wait_for_nl condition. When the wait_for_nl condition is set to True, the function incorrectly checks for an empty line when encountering a newline character. Instead, it should check if the current column is less than the specified column parameter.

To fix this bug, the condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column parameter should be revised. Additionally, the current_column count when encountering tabs should be adjusted to 8 (since it seems to be using a 4-space equivalent for tabs).

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Adjust for tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected values and types for the provided test cases.
