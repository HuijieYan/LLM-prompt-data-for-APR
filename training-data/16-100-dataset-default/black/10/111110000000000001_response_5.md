1. The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() is part of the Driver class.

2. The potential error location within the _partially_consume_prefix() function could be in the logic used to handle the current_column and wait_for_nl variables.

3. The cause of the bug is that the current_column and when to wait for a newline character are not being updated correctly within the function. This can lead to incorrect processing of the prefix string.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for updating current_column and wait_for_nl needs to be adjusted to accurately track the position within the prefix string.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix() function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_column += 1  # increment column count for every character
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # reset column count for new line
                lines.append(current_line + char)  # add the current line to lines list
                current_line = ""  # reset current line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line  # return the lines and current line
```

The corrected code includes adjustments to how the current_column and wait_for_nl variables are updated and adds handling for newline characters and tab characters within the prefix string.
