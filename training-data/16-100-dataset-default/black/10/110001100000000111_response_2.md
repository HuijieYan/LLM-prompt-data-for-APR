Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely to be in the logic for handling the indentation level when encountering tabs and spaces. 

Bug's cause:
The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix() is intended to handle the indentation of prefix text in code. However, the function fails to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation levels.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling tab characters to accurately calculate the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent, preserving the original indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the actual indentation level for tabs
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should address the issue described in the GitHub report and accurately handle tabulated comments after a dedent.
