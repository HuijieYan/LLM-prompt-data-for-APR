The bug is located in the logic implementing the `wait_for_nl` flag. This flag should be set to `True` if a space or tab is encountered, and it should be set to `False` when a new line is encountered.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing because the output of `fs(contents_tab)` does not match the expected output `contents_spc`. This is because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of the comment.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `wait_for_nl` flag according to the logic described above.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `wait_for_nl` flag in the cases where a space or tab is encountered, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of the comment and pass the failing test.
