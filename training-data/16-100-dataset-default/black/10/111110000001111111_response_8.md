Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function within the `Driver` class. The function incorrectly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used. This bug causes the comments to be misaligned after a dedent operation.

The cause of this bug is the mishandling of tab characters and whitespace characters when calculating the indentation level. Additionally, the function does not properly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering whitespace and tab characters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column position by counting the actual number of spaces for each tab character encountered. It also needs to properly update the `wait_for_nl` variable when encountering whitespace or tab characters in order to correctly handle the indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
                current_column += num_spaces
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code should now accurately handle tab characters, properly track the column position, and update the `wait_for_nl` variable as expected. This should fix the indentation issue for comments after a dedent in the provided test cases.
