The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables in response to different characters in the `prefix` string.

To fix the bug, the logic needs to be adjusted so that the `current_column` and `current_line` are updated appropriately for each character, and also that the correct value is returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
