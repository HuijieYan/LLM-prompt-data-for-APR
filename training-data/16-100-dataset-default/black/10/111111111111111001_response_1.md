The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the handling of the new line character and the indentation. It seems that the function does not correctly calculate the column value and does not handle the indentation properly when encountering spaces or tabs.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables is not correctly implemented, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables and properly handle the indentation when encountering spaces or tabs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation and column values correctly, satisfying all the expected input/output variable information provided and passing the failing test.
