The problem with the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation level when encountering a tab character. This causes it to incorrectly calculate the column number and to not properly handle the indentation changes after a dedent.

The bug's cause is the mishandling of tab characters in the prefix, which causes incorrect calculation of the current_column and wait_for_nl variables.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters, calculate the indentation level, and handle the wait_for_nl variable to correctly capture the prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for one tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle the indentation and correctly handle tab characters. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information and effectively resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
