1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column value. It seems to have issues with handling tabulated comments after a dedent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic related to handling tab characters and indentation levels.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to the mishandling of tab characters and indentation calculation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This could lead to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic for handling tab and space characters to ensure correct indentation levels are maintained.
   - Review how the function handles indentation and newline characters to ensure consistency in managing comments and code structure.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function (with adjustments for handling tab characters and maintaining correct indentation):

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab character handling to increment current_column by 4
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should address the issue with incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs, as reported in the GitHub issue.
