Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the _partially_consume_prefix function lies in the handling of the wait_for_nl condition when encountering a newline character. It seems that the code is incorrectly handling the indentation for comments when there is a dedent.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function: _partially_consume_prefix is not correctly handling the indentations and newlines for comments after a dedent.
(b). The buggy class: Driver contains the _partially_consume_prefix function.
(c). The related functions: The test_comment_indentation function in the failing test file tests for correct comment indentation.
(d). The failing test and error message: The failing test checks if the indentation for comments is correct. The error message shows that the comment indentation is not as expected.
(e). The GitHub issue information: The GitHub issue describes how Black reformats the comments incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The _partially_consume_prefix function should be modified to correctly handle indentation and newlines for comments after a dedent.
2. Adjust how the function tracks the current column and waits for a newline to ensure correct handling of comments.

Corrected Code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line regardless of the indentation
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code ensures that when encountering a newline, the current line is added to the lines list regardless of the indentation. This should fix the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
