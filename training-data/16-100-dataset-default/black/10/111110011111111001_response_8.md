The issue with the _partially_consume_prefix function seems to be in how it handles the indentation level. It is not correctly updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables. This is causing incorrect prefix consumption and incorrect output. 

One possible approach to fix this bug is to correctly update the current_column and wait_for_nl variables based on the characters encountered in the prefix. We also need to correctly handle the indentation level and line breaks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                if wait_for_nl:  # this is to ensure that the current_column is only updated when waiting for a new line
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                if wait_for_nl:  # similarly, only update current_column when waiting for a new line
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:  # handle indentation level and new line
                    current_column = 0
                else:  # unexpected empty line
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:  # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the prefix consumption and produce the expected output for the provided failing tests.
