The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and new lines. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables under certain conditions, which leads to incorrect results.

The bug is likely caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation level when waiting for a new line.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle indentation levels and new lines. We also need to ensure that the `current_column` and `current_line` variables are correctly updated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if char != '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now properly handle indentation levels and new lines, and update the `current_column` and `current_line` variables as expected.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
