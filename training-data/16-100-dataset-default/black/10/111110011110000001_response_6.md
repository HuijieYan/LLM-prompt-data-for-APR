The buggy function is intended to consume a prefix up to a certain column position and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The problem seems to be with the logic of handling indentation and new lines.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output is not matching the expected output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling indentation and new lines.

The buggy class contains the failing test function, which is intended to test the behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function with different contents. The error message indicates that the actual output of the function is not matching the expected output, leading to test failures.

The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect handling of indentation and new line characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and new lines within the function needs to be adjusted. One approach could be to separate the logic for handling different types of characters (space, tab, new line) and track the column position accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
    return res, remaining_prefix
```

This corrected function separates the logic for handling different types of characters, tracks the column position correctly, and returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. This version should pass the failing test.
