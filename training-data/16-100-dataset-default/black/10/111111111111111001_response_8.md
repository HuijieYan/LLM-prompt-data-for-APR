The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation of comments. When an indent is finished, it sets `wait_for_nl` to True, but it should only set it to True if a non-space or non-tab character follows. This is causing the indentation of comments to be incorrectly consumed.

To fix this issue, we can simply modify the condition for setting `wait_for_nl` to True to check for non-space and non-tab characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char not in (' ', '\t'):
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and the failing test should pass. The expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases should also be satisfied with this corrected function.
