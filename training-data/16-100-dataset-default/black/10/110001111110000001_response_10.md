The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be used for extracting a prefix of a string based on a given column number. However, it seems to have a bug related to handling indentation.

The failing test is trying to compare the output of the function with different indentation styles. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the indentation and comments correctly, resulting in a mismatch between expected and actual output.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the condition for checking `wait_for_nl`. When a comment is encountered, it is not handling the indentation properly.

The bug's cause seems to be related to how the function tracks indentation and waits for a newline character when encountering a comment. The current implementation does not handle the indentation and comment position correctly, leading to a mismatch in the test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Correctly tracking the indentation level.
2. Handling comments within the prefix properly.
3. Ensuring that the function preserves the original indentation style.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the indentation and comments, and pass the failing test.
