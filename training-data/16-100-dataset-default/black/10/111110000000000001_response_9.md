Potential Error Location:
There are a couple of potential error locations in the _partially_consume_prefix function. The first one is when the wait_for_nl condition is being checked, as it might not properly handle the case when char == '\n' and current_column < column. The second potential error is when the function returns res, prefix[len(res):], as it might not correctly handle the case when current_column < column.

Bug's Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl condition and the return statement. When the function encounters a newline character, it should check if the current_column is less than the specified column, and if so, it should return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check for current_column < column when wait_for_nl is True, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix accordingly.
2. Modify the return statement to correctly return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix if current_column < column.

Corrected Code:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The corrected code adds a check for current_column < column when wait_for_nl is True, and updates the return statement to correctly return the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed prefix.
