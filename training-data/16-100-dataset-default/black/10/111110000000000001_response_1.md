1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
2. The potential error location within the function is in the logic for checking the current column and waiting for a new line.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where the current line exceeds the specified column limit, and also does not handle the case where the prefix ends without encountering a new line.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly tracking the current column, handling the case where the column limit is exceeded, and ensuring that the function correctly handles the prefix ending without encountering a new line.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
            else:
                # current column limit exceeded
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function properly tracks the current column, checks for the column limit being exceeded, and correctly handles the prefix ending without encountering a new line.
