The error in the provided code is causing the incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments. This is leading to a failure in the test_comment_indentation test. The failing test indicates that the 'assertFormatEqual' function is comparing the expected and actual results of reformatting the input code, and the comparison fails due to incorrect indentation when encountering a comment.

The potential error location in the 'partially_consume_prefix' function seems to be in the logic for handling comments and indentation. It appears that the logic for handling comments and indentation is not correctly updating the 'current_column' and 'lines' variables, leading to incorrect results.

The buggy function does not handle the indentation correctly when encountering a comment in the prefix, leading to incorrect results and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling 'wait_for_nl', comments, and indentation needs to be adjusted to properly update the 'current_column' and 'lines' variables when encountering comments and whitespace characters.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling comments and indentation has been adjusted to properly update the 'current_column' and 'lines' variables when encountering comments and whitespace characters. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
