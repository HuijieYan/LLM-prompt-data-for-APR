1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class. The function is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. The function uses a loop to iterate through each character of the prefix, updating the `current_line` and `current_column` variables accordingly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling tab characters (`\t`). This is likely the source of the indentation issue, as the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable by 4 for each tab character encountered.

3. The cause of the bug is that when a tab character is encountered in the input prefix, the function incorrectly increases the `current_column` by 4 instead of 1 as it should. This leads to incorrect indentation levels, as illustrated in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic for handling tab characters to correctly update the `current_column` variable by 1 for each tab encountered.
   - Ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained when processing tab characters and dedents.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    while current_column % 4 != 0:
                        current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic for handling tab characters to increment the `current_column` by 1 until it is divisible by 4. This ensures that the correct indentation level is maintained, thereby addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
