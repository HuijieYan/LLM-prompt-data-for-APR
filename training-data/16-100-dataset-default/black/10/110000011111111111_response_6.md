Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to an incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent in the input file when it uses tabs.

Bug Cause:
The bug causes the comment indentation to be changed incorrectly after a dedent in the input file when it uses tabs. This is due to the incorrect handling of the indentation level within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling indentation and new line characters to correctly determine the indentation level for comments after a dedent.
2. Ensure that the function handles both tab and space indentation consistently.

Code Correction:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for the tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adjusts for the tab indentation and ensures that the function correctly handles the comment indentation after a dedent for both tab and space indentation.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent.
