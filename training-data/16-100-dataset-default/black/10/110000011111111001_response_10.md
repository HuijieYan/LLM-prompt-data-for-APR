The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to stem from the logic around handling the `wait_for_nl` flag and identifying when to return the result and the remaining prefix. It is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to properly handle the indentation and newline characters, and determine the correct position to return the result and the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version of the function handles the indentation and newline characters correctly, and returns the result and remaining prefix according to the expected behavior.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
