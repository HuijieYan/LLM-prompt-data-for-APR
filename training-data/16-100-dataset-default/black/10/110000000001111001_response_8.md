The issue with the buggy function is that when the current character of the prefix is a newline and the `wait_for_nl` flag is set, it should be checking that the `current_column` is less than the specified `column`. However, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not using the correct variable for comparison.

To fix this bug, the condition should be modified to `if current_column < column:` to correctly check if the current column is less than the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
