1. The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number, but it has a logic error causing it to not work as intended. The function maintains a list of lines and checks for new lines to determine when to consume the prefix. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `if wait_for_nl` where it is not properly checking for the current column number.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the current column number reaches the specified column. This causes it to not consume the prefix correctly. Additionally, the logic for handling tabs and spaces to calculate the column number is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly tracking the current column number, handling tabs and spaces to calculate the column number correctly, and updating the logic for consuming the prefix up to the specified column.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
        else:
            break
    res = current_line
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res):]
    while remaining_prefix.startswith('\n'):
        remaining_prefix = remaining_prefix[1:]
    return res, remaining_prefix
```
