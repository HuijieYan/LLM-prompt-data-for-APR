1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column. It tracks the current line, current column, and whether it's waiting for a new line. The function iterates over each character in the prefix string and updates the current line and column accordingly. If a newline character is encountered, it checks if the current line meets certain conditions and then appends it to the lines list. However, there are potential issues with how the current line and column are updated, as well as the logic for handling tab characters.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for updating the current column based on tab characters and spaces, as well as the handling of newlines.

3. The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of tab characters and spaces when updating the current column. Additionally, the logic for detecting the end of indentation is flawed, causing unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Revising the logic for updating the current column based on tab characters and spaces
   - Adjusting the condition for detecting the end of indentation
   - Refactoring the function to use a clearer and more robust approach for handling prefix consumption

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            current_line += char
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, the logic for updating the current column based on tab characters and spaces has been adjusted, and the condition for detecting the end of indentation has been improved. The function now provides the expected behavior when consuming the prefix based on the specified column.
