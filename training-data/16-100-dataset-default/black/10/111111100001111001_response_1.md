The potential error location in the function is in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:`. It checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the given column. However, the logic inside this condition seems incorrect.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic of checking the current column and returning the result. In various cases, the current column is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the current column and determining whether to return the result needs to be revised.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
