1. The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. It keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line. However, there are some issues with the logic and handling of certain cases.

2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of the "wait_for_nl" condition when a new line character is encountered.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle cases where the current line exceeds the specified column, and it does not correctly process the new line characters.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to accurately keep track of the column count, handle new line characters, and properly determine the result based on the specified column value.

5. Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling new line characters and updating the column count has been adjusted to properly consume the prefix based on the specified column value. Additionally, the result is accurately determined based on the specified column, and the function should now work as intended.
