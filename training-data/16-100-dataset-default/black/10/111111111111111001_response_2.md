The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and the updating of `current_column` and `current_line`.

The expected behavior of the function seems to be that it should partially consume the prefix until the specified column is reached. However, the condition for handling `wait_for_nl` and updating `current_column` seems to be incorrect.

One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to update the `wait_for_nl` condition and the handling of `current_column` to ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed until the specified column is reached.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
        current_column += 1

        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original function and ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed until the specified column is reached.
