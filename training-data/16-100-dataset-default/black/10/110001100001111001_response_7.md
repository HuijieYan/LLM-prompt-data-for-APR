Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the logic to handle the indentation and new lines in the prefix string. The current implementation is not correctly identifying the start of a new line after the indentation.

Bug's Cause:
The function is not properly handling the cases where there is whitespace at the beginning of a line and then a comment. It's not correctly tracking the indentation level and waiting for a new line character.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Keep track of the indentation level for each line to determine the start of a new line after the indentation.
2. Use a flag to indicate when a new line is being processed to correctly handle the indentation.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            # Reset column count after new line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The above corrected code should fix the issue by properly tracking and handling the indentation and new lines in the input string to produce the expected output for all the provided test cases.
