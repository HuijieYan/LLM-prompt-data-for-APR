1. The buggy function appears to be a method that partially consumes a prefix string up to a certain column, and returns the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix.

2. The potential error location is likely in the logic for handling the newline character, as well as the tracking of the current column.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the newline character and the calculation of the current column position.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adjusting the handling of the newline character to correctly reset the current column and append the consumed line to the list of lines.
   - Revising the logic for updating the current column when encountering spaces and tabs.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            # append the current line to the list of lines
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    # append the remaining part of the prefix
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
