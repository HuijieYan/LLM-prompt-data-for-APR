The issue with the buggy function is that it only appends the current line to the `lines` list if it encounters a newline character and the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True. However, there is a case where the `wait_for_nl` flag may remain False, such as when encountering spaces or tabs.

We need to append the current line to the `lines` list whenever the `current_column` exceeds the `column` input parameter, and then reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected cases and pass the failing test.
