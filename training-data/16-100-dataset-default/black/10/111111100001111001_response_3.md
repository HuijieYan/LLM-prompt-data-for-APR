The current function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug where it does not properly handle the indentation of spaces and tabs. It fails to correctly identify the number of columns when encountering spaces or tabs.

The bug is caused by the incorrect tracking of the column position while iterating through the prefix. The `current_column` variable is not updated correctly when encountering spaces or tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `current_column` variable based on the encountered character. For spaces, it should add 1 to the `current_column`, and for tabs, it should add 4 to the `current_column` to represent the equivalent number of spaces.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the indentation of spaces and tabs, and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
