The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is part of the `Driver` class and it is used to consume a portion of a string until it reaches a specific column number. The failing test is related to checking if the function correctly consumes a prefix until a comment line in an indented block of code.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line. It seems that the logic for consuming the prefix until a specific column might not be implemented correctly.

The failing test shows that the expected result is not equal to the actual result. This indicates that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix until the specified column.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line in the function.
2. Checking if the conditions for consuming the prefix and checking the column number are implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[i+1:]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code ensures that the prefix is consumed until the specified column limit is reached, and it should pass the failing test.
