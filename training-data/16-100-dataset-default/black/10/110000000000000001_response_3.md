1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix up to a certain column, but it contains logic errors that prevent it from functioning as intended.

2. The potential error location is the logic for checking if the current line has exceeded the specified column and for handling newlines.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the case when the current line exceeds the specified column before a newline, and it also does not handle the case when there is an unexpected empty line.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Keeping a separate variable to track the length of the current line and resetting it when encountering a newline or exceeding the specified column.
   (b) Properly handling the unexpected empty line case by resetting the current column to 0 when a newline is encountered.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            else:
                current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            if current_column <= column:
                current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
