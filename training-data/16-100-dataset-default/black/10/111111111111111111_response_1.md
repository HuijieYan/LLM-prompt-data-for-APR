Potential error location:
The issue may be in the logic related to handling the indentation of comments. It seems that the function is incorrectly handling the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent in the input code.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the input prefix based on certain conditions. It seems to be incorrectly adjusting the indentation level of comments, leading to the incorrect output. This behavior is causing this test to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent.
2. Verify and adjust the conditions for waiting for a newline and handling different characters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab equals 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should handle the indentation of comments correctly and satisfy the failing test cases provided. Additionally, it should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
