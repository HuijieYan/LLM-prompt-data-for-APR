The issue with the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation level when waiting for a new line. This causes incorrect results for input prefixes with tabs and spaces.

To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly track the current indentation level and handle whitespace characters, tabs, and new lines properly to determine the correct prefix before the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line = char
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly handle indentation, tabs, spaces, and newlines to produce the expected output for the given input prefixes and columns. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
