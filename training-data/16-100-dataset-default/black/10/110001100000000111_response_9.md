The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation and new lines in a given prefix string. The problem seems to arise when the input file uses tabs, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The potential error is likely occurring within the block of code that handles indentation, specifically within the `wait_for_nl` conditional block. It seems that the function is not correctly handling tabs as they contribute to the indentation level.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the function handles indentation and new lines. When tabs are used, the `current_column` calculation does not account for the fact that tabs represent more than 1 space.

To fix the bug, we can modify the portion of the code that calculates the `current_column` when encountering tabs. Instead of adding a fixed number (4) to `current_column`, we need to calculate the actual number of spaces represented by the tab.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces represented by the tab
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated code correctly handles tabs by calculating the number of spaces represented by the tab and adjusting the `current_column` accordingly. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
