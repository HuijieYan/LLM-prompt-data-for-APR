The buggy function is part of a codebase related to Python formatting that tries to convert an indented block of code to use a consistent number of spaces instead of tabs. The failing test is trying to compare the output of the function for the contents with tabs against the contents with spaces.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional logic for wait_for_nl and a new line character. It seems that the current implementation is not correctly handling indentations and new line characters, causing the generated output to be incorrect.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the incorrect handling of the indentations and new line characters in the function. This is leading to incorrect output and causing the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve refining the logic for handling indentations and new lines to ensure that the function correctly processes the input and generates the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentations and new line characters, producing the expected output and passing the failing test.
