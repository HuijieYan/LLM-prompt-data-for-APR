1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is part of the Driver class in the file driver.py. This function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining prefix.
   - The cases provided highlight issues related to indentation, handling of tabs, and incorrect consumption of the prefix.
   - The GitHub issue also mentions the problem with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent in the code.

2. Potential error location:
   - The conditional checks in the for loop seem to be the potential source of the issue, specifically the handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

3. Bug cause:
   - The buggy function is not correctly distinguishing and handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters, leading to incorrect indentation and prefix consumption.
   - The use of if-elif statements is causing discrepancies in the indentation and prefix consumption based on different types of characters.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditional checks to appropriately handle spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
   - Ensure that the prefix consumption and indentation are accurately managed, especially after dedent operations.
   - Consider using a different approach, possibly a stateful parsing method, to handle the prefix consumption and indentation accurately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code modifies the conditional checks and the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It ensures that the prefix consumption and indentation are managed accurately, addressing the issues mentioned in both the test cases and the GitHub issue.
