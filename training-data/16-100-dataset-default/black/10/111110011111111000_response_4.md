The issue in the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the prefix to be consumed starts with indentation and the column position is less than the indentation. It also does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:  # Check if the current column is less than or equal to the specified column
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the different cases provided and should resolve the failing test.
