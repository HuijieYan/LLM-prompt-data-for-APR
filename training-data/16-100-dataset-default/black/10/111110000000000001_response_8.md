1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.

2. The potential error in the function could be in the logic for handling the newline character, as well as in the calculation of the current column position.

3. The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of the newline character and the calculation of the current column position, which may result in an incorrect output when consuming the prefix.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the newline character is handled correctly and that the current column position is updated accurately as the prefix is consumed.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
            
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                return ''.join(lines), prefix
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the logic for handling the newline character and the calculation of the current column position. We have also adjusted the return statement to ensure the correct output is returned.
