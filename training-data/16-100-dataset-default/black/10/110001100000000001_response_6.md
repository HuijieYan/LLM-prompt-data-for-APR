1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specific column value. It iterates through each character in the prefix string and keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it is waiting for a new line. The function has a logic flaw in handling new lines and indentations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic around handling new lines and indentations. There are issues with correctly updating the current line, column, and handling empty lines.

3. The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly handles new lines and does not properly update the line and column values, leading to incorrect results. In particular, the handling of whitespace characters and new lines is causing the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding separate checks for whitespace and new line characters to properly update the line and column values.
   - Ensuring that the logic for checking the indentation and handling new lines is correctly implemented.

5. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling new lines and updating the line and column values has been improved. The function now correctly handles new lines and indentation, ensuring that the prefix string is partially consumed based on the specified column value.
