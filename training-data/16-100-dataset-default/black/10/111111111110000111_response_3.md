The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling indentation and comments. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the given prefix based on certain conditions, including indentation and new lines.

The bug's cause is that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully examine the logic for handling comments and indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the indentation level and handles comments appropriately, especially after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
