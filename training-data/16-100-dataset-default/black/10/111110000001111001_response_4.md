The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling tab characters ('\t'). It incorrectly counts the columns when encountering tab characters. The function should count each tab character as 4 spaces, but it is not doing so.

The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable by only 1 for each tab character, instead of 4. This causes the function to incorrectly check for the column value and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for incrementing the `current_column` variable when encountering tab characters. We need to change it to increment by 4 instead of 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increment by 4 for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle tab characters correctly and produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
