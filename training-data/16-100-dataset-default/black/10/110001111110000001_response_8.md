Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be occurring when the comment is encountered in the `contents_tab` string, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

Bug's Cause:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the comment properly, which is creating a discrepancy between the expected and actual output in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for processing comments so that it does not cause discrepancies in the output.
2. Update the conditional statements to correctly handle the comment indentation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent or comment is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle the comment indentation and pass the failing test.
