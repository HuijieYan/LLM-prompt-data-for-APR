The problematic function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments after dedent. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, where the expected and actual output for tabulated comments are different.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic related to handling the indentation of comments.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments when there is a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments, as seen in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the indentation of comments needs to be corrected. Specifically, it should account for cases where there is a dedent and adjust the indentation of comments accordingly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to track the level of indentation and adjust the indentation of comments based on the current level of indentation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly, as well as pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided. It should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
