The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be designed to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on a given column value. However, the function has a logic error in the section where it checks for new line characters and resets the current line and column values. 

The bug is caused by the condition `if char == '\n':` being placed after the condition `elif char == ' ':` and `elif char == '\t':`. This results in the code for processing new line characters being executed only after spaces and tabs have been processed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the code for processing new line characters should come before the code for processing spaces and tabs.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code rearranges the conditionals to prioritize processing new line characters first, ensuring that the current line and column are updated correctly. This fix aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.
