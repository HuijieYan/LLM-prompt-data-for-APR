Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the logic used to handle the indentation of comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming a prefix of text and handling indentation.
(b). The logic inside the function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments, especially after a dedent.
(c). The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is asserting that the formatting of the input text is equal to the expected output, but it fails due to incorrect comment indentation.
(d). The error message indicates that a comment's indentation is being changed incorrectly after a dedent.
(e). The GitHub Issue provides more context, stating that the issue occurs when using tabs for indentation and that comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This may involve re-evaluating the conditions and handling of whitespace characters and newlines.

2. Consider refactoring the logic to handle different types of indentation consistently, whether it's tabs or spaces.

3. It might be necessary to introduce more specific checks for comment indentation and handle them separately from other types of indentation.

Corrected Code:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 4  # Change to 4 to handle tab indentation
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 1  # Change to 1 to handle space indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code includes adjustments to the handling of indentation with spaces and tabs. The if conditions and indentation adjustments have been modified to handle both types of indentation consistently. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
