1. The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" seems to be used in the test_comment_indentation function to compare the formatting of the contents with spaces and tabs. The error message indicates that the "assertFormatEqual" method is failing, showing a difference in indentation for the comment line.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the logic related to handling indentation and waiting for a new line (wait_for_nl).

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of indentation and new lines in the _partially_consume_prefix function. This is leading to incorrect comparison results in the test code.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation and new lines needs to be adjusted to correctly consume the prefix and compare the formatting as expected.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now correctly consume the prefix and compare the formatting of the contents with spaces and tabs, passing the failing test.
