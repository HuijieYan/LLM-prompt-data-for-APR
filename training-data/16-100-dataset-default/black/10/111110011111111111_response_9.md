Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It keeps track of the current line, the current column, and whether it is waiting for a new line. It then iterates through the characters of the prefix and updates the variables accordingly.

The failing test "test_comment_indentation" compares the formatting of code with tabs and spaces, and the error message indicates that the comment indentation is not being handled correctly after a dedent.

The expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution, as well as the GitHub issue, point to the issue with incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for handling new lines and updating the current column and waiting for new line variables.

Bug's cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of new lines and comment indentation after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting and failing the test.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of new lines and comment indentation after a dedent to maintain correct formatting.
2. Update the logic for updating the current column and waiting for new line variables to accurately reflect the indentation of comments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # handle unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code ensures proper handling of new lines and comment indentation after a dedent. It maintains correct formatting and should pass the failing test. This fixes the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
