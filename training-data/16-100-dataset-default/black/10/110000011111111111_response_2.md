1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string and consume characters up to a specified column. It maintains a list of lines and a current line, along with a current column and a flag to track whether it should wait for a new line. It encountered an issue where it incorrectly handled white spaces and tabs, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. The failing test provided demonstrates the issue by showing the incorrect reformatting of the comments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for white spaces and tabs, as well as the logic for determining when to wait for a new line (`wait_for_nl`).

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of white spaces and tabs, as well as the logic for waiting for a new line. These factors combined to produce incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Revising the logic for handling white spaces and tabs to ensure correct column tracking.
   - Adjusting the logic for determining when to wait for a new line to correctly account for indentation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column without causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. This updated version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
