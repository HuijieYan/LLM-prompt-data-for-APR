### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column in order to format the code. The function appears to have issues with handling whitespace characters and updating the current column count correctly.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares formatting of code with spaces and tabs. The specific failing assertion error indicates that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix, leading to incorrect formatting of the code.

The function keeps track of the current line, column, and uses a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle newline characters. However, it fails to correctly consume the prefix and update the variables accordingly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by improper handling of whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters, leading to incorrect calculations of the column count and the partially consumed prefix.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic for handling space, tab, and newline characters appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column and updates the variables accordingly.
3. Consider refactoring the function to simplify the logic and improve readability.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function now correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column and updates the variables accordingly. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
