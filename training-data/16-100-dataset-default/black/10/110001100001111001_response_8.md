The problematic function is not updating the `current_column` correctly, which leads to incorrect results in the return. The issue seems to be with how the `current_column` variable is updated based on the characters encountered in the `prefix`.

To fix the bug, the `current_column` variable needs to be updated correctly based on the characters encountered in the `prefix`. Additionally, the conditions inside the loop need to be adjusted to ensure that the `current_column` is updated appropriately for each character in the `prefix`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
