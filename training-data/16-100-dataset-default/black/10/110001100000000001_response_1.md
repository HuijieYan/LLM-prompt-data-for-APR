1. The _partially_consume_prefix function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column. It processes each character in the prefix string, keeping track of the current line and column. However, there are some issues with the logic, which result in incorrect behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition for checking the current_column and handling the wait_for_nl flag. These conditions are not properly capturing the expected behavior and causing the function to produce incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function does not correctly handle the wait_for_nl flag and does not properly update the lines list, resulting in incorrect output.
   (b) The related functions that use this _partially_consume_prefix function may experience issues when the consumed prefix is not correctly processed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for handling the wait_for_nl flag and processing the current_line and column.
   - Ensure that the lines list is correctly updated when a new line is encountered.
   - Test the function with various input scenarios to verify the correct behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected code addresses the issues with handling the wait_for_nl flag and properly updating the lines list, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and returns the correct output.
