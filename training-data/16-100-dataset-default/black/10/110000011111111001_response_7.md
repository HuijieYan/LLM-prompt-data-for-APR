The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partitally consume a prefix based on a given column and return a new prefix with the consumed portion removed, but it contains several issues leading to the failing test case. The function did not correctly handle the indentation levels introduced by tabs and spaces. It also missed an indentation after consuming the prefix.

The potential error location is the logic for handling tabs and spaces within the `for` loop, as well as the condition for generating a new prefix.
The cause of the bug is the incorrect way of handling indentation levels and the failure to keep track of them properly.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should:
1. Improve handling of indentation levels with tabs and spaces.
2. Maintain the current column count accurately.
3. Include the consumed prefix in the final result when generating a new prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ' and current_column < column:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and current_column < column:
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif current_column < column:
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected function goes through the prefix character by character, maintaining the correct column count, and handling indentation levels with tabs and spaces accurately. It returns the consumed portion of the prefix and the new prefix as expected.
