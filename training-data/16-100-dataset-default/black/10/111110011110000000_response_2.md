# The corrected version of the function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This correction includes the addition of appending `current_line` immediately after encountering a newline character, independent of the `wait_for_nl` condition. This allows `current_line` to be added to the `lines` list even when encountering newline characters without `wait_for_nl` being set.
