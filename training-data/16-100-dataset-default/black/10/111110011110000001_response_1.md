1. It seems that the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for an incorrect indentation error.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the block where the function checks for wait_for_nl, char, and newline characters.
3. The bug is likely occurring due to an incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl and current_column logic. This is causing the indentation to be misinterpreted, resulting in the incorrect output. The failing test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the function. The error message confirms that the indentation is not being handled correctly.
4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review how the function is handling the wait_for_nl and current_column logic and make necessary adjustments to ensure proper handling of indentation and newline characters.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should address the incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, and it should pass the failing test.
