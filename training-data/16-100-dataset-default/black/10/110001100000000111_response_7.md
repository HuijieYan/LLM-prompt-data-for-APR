1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix and returning the consumed portion and the remaining portion. The GitHub issue indicates that when the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic related to handling tabs and indentation levels.

3. (a) The buggy function processes each character in the `prefix` string, updating `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly. It also checks for tab, space, and newline characters to manage indentation.
   (b) The related functions in the library `blib2to3` may have similar logic for managing indentation and processing comments.
   (c) The GitHub issue provides a specific example and describes how the indentation is being incorrectly changed for comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic related to tab characters and indentation levels.
   - Ensure that comments past depth 0 are correctly handled after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Emulate tab width of 8
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for handling tab characters has been updated to emulate a tab width of 8 spaces.
- The condition `current_column < column` has been changed to `current_column <= column` to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained.
