The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string and stop at a specific column, returning the consumed prefix and the remaining suffix. However, based on the failing test and expected input/output variables, it seems that the function does not handle the indentation and comment properly.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation and comment within the prefix string. The function does not correctly handle the expected indentation and comment scenarios, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and comment characters.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        if in_comment:
            current_line += char
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes handling for comments and correctly processes indentation. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
