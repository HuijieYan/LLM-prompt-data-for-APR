The issue with the buggy function is that it fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when partially consuming a prefix string. This causes the failing test to raise an assertion error because it compares the expected and actual output strings and finds a discrepancy in the indentation of a comment.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments when consuming the prefix string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust current_column based on tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # handle new line for the current line
                current_line = ""  # reset current_line
                current_column = 0  # reset current_column
                wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # if any other character, wait for new line
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and pass the failing test.
