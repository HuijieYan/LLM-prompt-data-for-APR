The issue with the current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be with how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being set and unset. It appears that the condition for unsetting `wait_for_nl` is incorrect in the original implementation, which leads to incorrect processing of the input.

To fix this issue, the condition for unsetting `wait_for_nl` needs to be updated so that it occurs when a non-space character is encountered. This will ensure that the function correctly processes the input prefix and produces the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code updates the condition for unsetting `wait_for_nl` by checking if the current character is not a space or a tab. This ensures that the function behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given input scenarios.
