1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a given prefix up to a specified column. It maintains a list of lines and a current line to track the consumption of the prefix.

2. The potential error location within the function is the condition for checking if the current character is a newline while waiting for a newline.

3. The bug's cause is related to the mishandling of newlines while waiting for a newline character. This causes the function to not correctly identify when to stop consuming the prefix and when to start a new line.

4. To fix the bug, we can adjust the logic for handling newlines and waiting for a newline while consuming the prefix. We should also consider edge cases such as unexpected empty lines.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we have moved the character counting logic for spaces and tabs inside the `wait_for_nl` block. This ensures that the column count is updated only when waiting for a newline. We have also handled the unexpected empty line by resetting the current column and adding the current line to the list of lines. This should fix the bug and correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
