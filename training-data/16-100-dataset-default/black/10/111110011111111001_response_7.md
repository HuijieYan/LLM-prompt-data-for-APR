The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the current column is less than the specified column and a new line character is encountered. This causes the function to return the incorrect prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column and char != '\n' and char != '\t':
                current_column += 1
                if current_column <= column:
                    current_line += char
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
                current_line += char
            else:
                # char is a new line character
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                
        return (''.join(lines), current_line)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation based on the specified column and return the expected prefix. This should resolve the failing test case and the error message provided.
