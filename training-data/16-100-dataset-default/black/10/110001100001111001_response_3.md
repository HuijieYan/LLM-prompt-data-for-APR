The bug in the function appears to be in the logic related to handling newlines and indentations. The function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column, but there are issues with handling newlines and updating the current column when encountering spaces or tabs.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated when encountering spaces or tabs, and that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set and reset appropriately when encountering newlines.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
