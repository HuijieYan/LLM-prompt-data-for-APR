The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect calculation of the current_column and the conditions to determine when to return the result. The current_column is not being updated correctly when encountering a whitespace character.

To fix the bug, the current_column should be updated properly based on the type of character encountered. Additionally, the condition for when to return the result should be modified to correctly check if the current_column is less than the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
