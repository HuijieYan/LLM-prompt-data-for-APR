The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. It seems that the function is not correctly handling whitespace characters, which is causing the failing test.

The main issues with the function are:
1. The handling of indentation levels is incorrect.
2. It does not correctly capture the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

To fix this, we need to update the function to correctly handle the indentation levels and track the consumed prefix and remaining prefix.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        remaining_prefix = prefix
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                break
        
        remaining_prefix = remaining_prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        
        return ''.join(lines), remaining_prefix
```

With this corrected function, it should handle the indentation levels correctly and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix as expected, passing the failing test.
