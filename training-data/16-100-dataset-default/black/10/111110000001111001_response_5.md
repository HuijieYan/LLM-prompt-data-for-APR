The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column number. It iterates through the prefix character by character and processes it based on the type of character encountered. The issues in the current implementation arise from the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for updating `current_column`.

Upon analyzing the function in relation to the input/output variable information, it becomes evident that the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is flawed. This results in incorrect processing of the input prefix and inconsistent behavior based on different inputs.

The bug's cause is rooted in the incorrect logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags, leading to the incomplete consumption of the prefix and incoherent behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` needs to be revised. Additionally, the handling of the `lines` list should be adjusted to accurately capture the consumed prefix lines.

Below is the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                # indent is finished
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line += char
                for c in current_line:
                    if c == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif c == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    else:
                        break
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this revised implementation, the function should now accurately process the input prefix and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
