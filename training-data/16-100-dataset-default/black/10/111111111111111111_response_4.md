The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix string based on a specified column. The function seems to have an issue with correctly handling the indentation of lines with comments after a dedent, as indicated in the failing test for tabulated comments. The function's implementation is not properly tracking the column where the comments should be placed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` after encountering a newline character.

The bug's cause is that after encountering a newline character, the condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column (`current_column < column`) and adding the current line to the lines list is not properly handled. This is leading to incorrect indentation for comments after the dedent.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be considered:
1. Adjust the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` and handling of whitespace characters to correctly track the column and handle the comments' indentation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the indentation of the comments after a dedent is handled correctly based on the specified column. It should pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output variable information provided. Furthermore, this correction should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect handling of comments after a dedent when using tabs.
