Issue:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the counting of empty lines, which is causing the failing test to produce unexpected results.

Cause:
The function is not properly considering the conditions for adding empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It appears that the logic for defining the number of empty lines is flawed, leading to inconsistent output. The failing test is asserting for expected and actual results, and they are not matching due to the flawed logic in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic for counting empty lines based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.
2. Refactor the function to simplify the logic and make it more understandable.
3. Check if the conditions for adding empty lines are correctly implemented and consider edge cases.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator and self.previous_line:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
                and not current_line.is_import
                and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
                and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function logic has been revised to ensure that the conditions for adding empty lines are implemented correctly. It is simplified and should now produce the expected results as per the failing test.
