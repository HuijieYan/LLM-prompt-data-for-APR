The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic around the `newlines` variable. Based on the expected values and types of variables, it seems like the `newlines` variable is not being calculated correctly.

The `newlines` variable is expected to be calculated based on certain conditions, including the `is_decorator` and `is_flow_control` attributes of the `current_line` object. However, there seem to be issues with the logic for calculating `newlines`, which is causing discrepancies in the expected and actual output values.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the `newlines` variable needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that it accurately reflects the expected behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that incorporates the necessary changes to address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce results that align with the expected values and types of variables provided in the failing test cases.
