Based on the given information, the bug occurs in the section of the code where the function `_maybe_empty_lines` determines newlines to be added before and after the currently processed line. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the variable `newlines`. 

The function tries to calculate the value of `newlines` based on certain conditions, and it seems that the conditions are not being properly evaluated, leading to incorrect values for `newlines`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the calculation of `newlines` to ensure that it correctly captures the intended logic for determining the number of newlines to be added.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the issues and satisfies the expected input/output variable information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1  # Updated this condition to set newlines to 1 when current_line.depth is not 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the variable `newlines` is calculated according to the specified conditions and resolves the bug that was causing incorrect values for the return variables.
