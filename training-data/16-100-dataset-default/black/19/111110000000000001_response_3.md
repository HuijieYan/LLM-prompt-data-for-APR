Potential error location: The function is checking for the condition `if depth` which is evaluating to true if depth is not zero, instead of checking if depth is greater than zero.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the condition `if depth`. The variable `depth` is an integer value indicating the depth of the current line. The condition `if depth` is checking if `depth` is not zero, and if true, it sets `newlines` to 1 instead of 2. This is incorrect as it should be checking if `depth` is greater than zero.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition `if depth` needs to be changed to `if depth > 0` to correctly check if the depth is greater than zero, and adjust the value of `newlines` accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
