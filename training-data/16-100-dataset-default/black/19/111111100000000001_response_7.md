The buggy function _maybe_empty_lines is part of the class EmptyLineTracker and is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the "return 0, 0" statement under the condition "if self.previous_line is None”. It doesn't correctly handle the case when the previous line is None.

The bug's cause is that the function doesn't account for the case when the previous line is None, resulting in potential unexpected behavior when self.previous_line is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle the case when self.previous_line is None before the "return 0, 0" statement.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the condition when the previous line is None.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the condition for handling the case when self.previous_line is None is included at the beginning of the function before other logic is processed. This ensures that the function handles this case appropriately.
