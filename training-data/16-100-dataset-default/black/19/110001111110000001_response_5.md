Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue is likely related to the handling of empty lines in the _maybe_empty_lines function.

Bug's cause:
The failing test "test_comment_in_decorator" from the test_black.py file is failing with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output when calling the assertFormatEqual method. This suggests that the _maybe_empty_lines function is not correctly handling the formatting of comments within decorators.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic in the _maybe_empty_lines function to ensure that it properly handles the formatting of comments within decorators.
2. Check for any conditional statements within the function that might be causing incorrect behavior in the presence of comments within decorators.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not self.is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, the is_import and is_yield functions are called with the correct parameters to check for import and yield statements. This should ensure that the function properly handles comments within decorators and resolves the failing test.
