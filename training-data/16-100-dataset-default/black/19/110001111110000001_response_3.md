The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` and it seems to be related to the formatting of comments in the input source code. The failing test is specifically related to a comment in a decorator, and the error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the formatting.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be in the part where it handles decorators and comments. It appears that the function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly when encountering comments within decorators.

The bug's cause could be due to the incorrect handling of comments within decorators, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling comments within decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. Verify that the function is correctly identifying comments and decorators, and is inserting the appropriate number of empty lines based on the presence of comments within decorators.
3. Update the logic to ensure that comments within decorators are handled correctly and the correct number of empty lines is inserted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # existing logic...

    if current_line.is_decorator and any(isinstance(leaf, Comment) for leaf in current_line.leaves):
        return 0, 0  # No empty lines for comments within decorators

    # existing logic...

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic to specifically handle comments within decorators and not insert empty lines in those cases, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
