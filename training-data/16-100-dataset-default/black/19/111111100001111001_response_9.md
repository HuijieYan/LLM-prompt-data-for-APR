The bug in the function is that the newlines computation in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is incorrect. The function fails to return the expected values based on the input parameters.

The bug appears to be due to incorrect handling of the conditions and assignments within the function, leading to incorrect computation of the number of newlines. Additionally, the updating of variables such as `first_leaf.prefix` and `before` may not be handled properly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks need to be revised to ensure that the correct values are being assigned to variables such as `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected code should ensure that the function returns the expected values based on the input parameters provided in the failing test cases.
