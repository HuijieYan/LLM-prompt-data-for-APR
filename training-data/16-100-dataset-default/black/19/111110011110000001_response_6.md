The potential error location within the problematic function is that the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is incorrect.

The failing test is testing a scenario where comments and decorators are used in the code. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the function. This suggests that the indentation, empty lines, and comments are not being handled correctly, leading to a formatting mismatch.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and update the logic for handling indentation, decorators, and comments in the _maybe_empty_lines function.
2. Ensure that the function correctly computes the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the presence of decorators, comments, and indentation depth.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        newlines = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
                newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
                return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        
        return 0, 0
```

In the corrected code:
1. The function checks for decorators and handles them separately to avoid inserting empty lines.
2. It correctly handles indentation for classes and functions to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
3. It also properly handles flow control, imports, and yield statements to ensure the correct number of empty lines.
