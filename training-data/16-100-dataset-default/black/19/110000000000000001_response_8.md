Potential error location: 
The potential error in the buggy function may be the incorrect handling of empty lines based on certain conditions and the use of the `before` variable in different places without proper reassignment.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug could be that the `before` variable is not properly reassigned in all the conditional branches, leading to incorrect calculation of empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is correctly reassigned in all conditional branches.
2. Check the logic for handling empty lines before the return statements and make sure it aligns with the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0
        
    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, the handling of the `before` variable is improved, and the conditional branches are properly organized for correct calculation of empty lines.
