The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which appears to be causing an issue in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test. The bug seems to be related to the handling of newlines before and after certain lines, as indicated by the error message showing discrepancies in expected and actual output.

The failing test is comparing the expected and actual formatted strings and finding a mismatch that involves the presence or absence of newlines. This indicates that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not accurately handling the newlines before and after certain lines.

The expected input/output information shows that the function should be able to identify the number of newlines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions, such as whether the line is a decorator, flow control, import, or class. The output variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, `is_decorator`, and `newlines` are relevant to the computation of newlines before and after the line.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the computation of newlines based on the conditions specified. This could involve updating the logic for each conditional block to accurately determine the number of newlines required before and after the line based on the given conditions. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    newlines = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator and self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected code accounts for the various conditions and computes the number of newlines required before and after the currently processed line more accurately.

By using the updated logic, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
