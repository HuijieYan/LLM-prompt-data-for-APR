The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the newlines and prefixes for certain types of lines, such as decorators, class definitions, and flow control. This is leading to incorrect empty line calculations and prefixes, causing the failing test to report a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is handling newlines and prefixes for different types of lines. The expected and actual output variable information shows discrepancies in the number of newlines and the prefixes for certain lines, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for handling newlines, prefixes, and different line types in the function. Ensuring that the correct number of newlines and prefixes are set based on the type of line and its context should help resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues identified and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
