The potential error location within the problematic function is at the logic for updating the `before` variable. The code is incorrectly updating the `before` variable with the value of `1` if `depth` is not equal to 0. This is incorrect as it should only be updated to `1` if `is_decorator` is `True`. 

The potential cause of the bug is the incorrect condition for updating the `before` variable based on the value of `depth`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Correcting the condition for updating the `before` variable based on `is_decorator` instead of `depth`.
- Verify if `self.previous_defs` is correctly maintained and used in the while loop.

The corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
