1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted between lines of code. It calls several related functions like `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield` to make these decisions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the conditions provided.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect logic or condition checking in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It may not be correctly identifying the proper conditions for inserting empty lines based on the related functions it is calling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
   - Review and refactor the conditional logic to ensure that the correct conditions are being checked for inserting empty lines.
   - Check the return values based on the conditions being evaluated and ensure they align with the expected behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import(self) and not current_line.is_import(self) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield(self) and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the function calls the related functions with `self` as an argument to access the class properties. Additionally, the logic in the various conditional statements has been reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
