The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines` and it seems to be responsible for managing the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions. The function makes use of various attributes and methods from the same file but different classes, such as `current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `self.previous_defs`, and `self.previous_line`.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic used to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The function checks for various conditions related to the current and previous lines, such as whether the current line is a decorator, a class, a function definition, flow control, an import, or a yield statement.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect logic within the function that determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. This could be caused by incorrect condition checks or incorrect handling of the previous line's attributes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include reviewing the condition checks within the function to ensure they accurately capture the desired behavior for inserting empty lines. Additionally, verifying the interaction with the attributes and methods from related functions to ensure consistency in behavior and logic.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, I have made the following changes:
1. Corrected the function calls to `is_import()` and `is_yield()` in the respective condition checks.
2. Added necessary parentheses to ensure the correct method calls.
3. Fixed indentation and block structures for better readability.
