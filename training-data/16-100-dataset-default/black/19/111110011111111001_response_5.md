The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`. It seems to be managing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

Based on the provided error message and runtime information, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the computation of expected empty lines before and after the current line.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional checks and assignments within the logic for computing `before` and `newlines`.

The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect computation of the values for `before` and `newlines`, which results in an incorrect number of empty lines before and after the current line.

To fix this bug, one approach is to carefully review the logic used to compute the values of `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions and the input `current_line`. Adjust the conditional checks and assignments to ensure that the proper number of empty lines is computed.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < current_line.depth]

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import 
            and not current_line.is_import 
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield 
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected function is updated to properly compute the values for `before` and `newlines` based on the given conditions and input parameters.

This corrected function should address the issues and satisfy the failing test case as well as the expected input/output variable information.
