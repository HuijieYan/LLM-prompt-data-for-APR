1. The `assertFormatEqual` test is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The error message indicates that there are extra newlines being inserted in the actual output compared to the expected output. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which is responsible for handling newlines, has a bug that is causing it to insert extra newlines.

2. The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely in the section where newlines are being manipulated based on different conditions.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the insertion of newlines before certain types of lines. This is causing extra newlines to be added in the actual output compared to the expected output, leading to the test failure.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditions for inserting newlines and ensuring they are implemented correctly.
   - Checking the logic for handling different types of lines and ensuring that the appropriate number of newlines is inserted based on the conditions.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: list, is_decorator: bool, is_def: bool, is_class: bool, is_flow_control: bool, is_import: bool, is_yield: bool):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = Line(depth=0, leaves=[], is_decorator=False, is_def=False, is_class=False, is_flow_control=False, is_import=False, is_yield=False)

def _maybe_empty_lines(current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while Example.previous_defs and Example.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        Example.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            Example.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if Example.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if Example.previous_line and Example.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        Example.previous_line
        and Example.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == Example.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        Example.previous_line
        and Example.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != Example.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected code provides a fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, ensuring that the newlines are inserted correctly based on the conditions. This should resolve the issue raised in the failing test.
