The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the calculation of the number of newlines and the indent depth in certain conditions. The function seems to be incorrectly handling cases where `is_decorator`, `is_def`, or `is_class` is true.

The failing test is showing that the expected and actual output are different, with an extra newline being added in the actual output when it shouldn't be there.

It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation depth and newlines in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with decorators, classes, and functions.

To fix the bug, we would need to review the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, paying close attention to the conditions related to decorators, classes, and functions, and ensure that the correct number of newlines are added based on the presence of these elements. Additionally, we need to verify the logic for the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` variables.

Below is a possible approach for fixing the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected code, we have made adjustments to the condition checking for decorators, classes, and functions to ensure that the correct number of newlines are added based on these conditions. The logic for `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` has also been reviewed to ensure correct behavior. This should address the issues seen in the failing test and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output variable information.
