The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the `if` conditions and updating the variables `before` and `newlines`. Specifically, the logic for setting `newlines` does not seem to be correct.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a lot of conditional logic based on the attributes of `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. It has too many `if` conditions and often misses updating the values of `newlines` and `before` variables.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting `newlines` and `before` needs to be reviewed and updated. Additionally, the logic within the various `if` conditions should be thoroughly checked to make sure all relevant attributes are considered properly.

The signature of the corrected code should retain the input parameters and return type as defined in the expected test cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected function should address the faulty logic and should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
