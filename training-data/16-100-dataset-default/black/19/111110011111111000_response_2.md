The issue with the function is that it doesn't return the correct number of newlines before and after the currently processed line. It contains logic to handle different scenarios based on the line type and depth, but it's not properly calculating the number of newlines to return.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the logic fixed:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """


    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        after = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
            return newlines, after
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = 1
        
        return before, after
```

The corrected function now properly calculates the number of newlines before and after the currently processed line based on the line type and depth.

Please note that this is a speculative correction based on the provided information and assumptions about the desired behavior of the function. Further context about the Line and Leaf classes, as well as the overall purpose of the EmptyLineTracker, would be needed for a more accurate and comprehensive correction.
