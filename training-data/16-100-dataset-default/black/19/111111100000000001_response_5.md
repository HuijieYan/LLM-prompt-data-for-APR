The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is trying to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on various conditions and properties of the current and previous lines. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the conditions for certain line types (such as decorators, imports, etc.) which is leading to an incorrect calculation of empty lines.

The bug's cause is due to incorrect handling of the conditions for different line types and the incorrect update of the previous_defs list.

To fix the bug, you can follow these approaches:
1. Update the conditions for handling different line types such as decorators, imports, etc.
2. Correctly handle the update of the previous_defs list based on the depth of the current line.
3. Reevaluate the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on the given conditions.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, the conditions for handling different line types have been updated to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. Additionally, the update of the previous_defs list has been corrected based on the depth of the current line.
