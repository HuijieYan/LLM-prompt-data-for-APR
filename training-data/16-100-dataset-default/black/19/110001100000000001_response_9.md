The potential error location within the problematic function is in the first "if" statement where "max_allowed" is assigned a value based on the depth of the current line. This could lead to a situation where "max_allowed" is not updated correctly resulting in incorrect behavior.

The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the "max_allowed" variable. The value of "max_allowed" is set to 1 initially, but then it is updated to 2 based on a condition related to the depth of the current line. This could result in "max_allowed" being set to 2 even when it should be 1.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for setting the "max_allowed" variable to ensure that it is consistently initialized based on the conditions. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the handling of the "before" variable and its relationship with "max_allowed".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    # Other functions and class members...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        # Rest of the function remains the same...

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for setting the "max_allowed" variable is maintained, but it is also ensured that it is consistently initialized based on the conditions.
