The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The bug appears to be caused by not properly handling certain cases of newlines and conditions.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output, leading to an assertion error. This suggests that the function is not producing the correct number of empty lines in the specific case of comments in decorators.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be modified to properly handle the cases of comments in decorators and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the specific conditions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic within the function to address the specific cases where the number of empty lines is not being calculated correctly. This may involve adjusting the conditionals and calculations within the function to accurately determine the required number of empty lines.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` produces the expected output, satisfying the failing test case and the expected input/output variable information provided.
