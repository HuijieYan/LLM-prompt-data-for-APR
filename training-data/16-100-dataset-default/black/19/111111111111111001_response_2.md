The buggy function seems to be incorrectly determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. The function seems to be making multiple calculations based on the current line and the previous line.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not matching. This indicates that the function is not correctly inserting empty lines as expected.

The bug in the code appears to be related to how the function is handling the insertion of empty lines based on different conditions, such as whether the current line is a decorator, a def, or a yield, and the relationship between the current line and the previous line.

To fix the bug, the logic for inserting empty lines based on different conditions needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially revised. The conditions and the corresponding actions of the function need to be carefully examined to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after the current line.

Additionally, the relationship between the current line and the previous line needs to be properly analyzed to determine the correct course of action for inserting empty lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_yield or current_line.is_class:
        # Insert empty lines based on the conditions
        return 0, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with inserting the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the given conditions.
