The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines and decorators. The expected values indicate that the function should be handling the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the input parameters.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the expected values and the failing test:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# assuming that Line and Leaf classes are defined elsewhere
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        # attributes is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, is_yield should be defined based on the actual usage

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, kind, value):
        self.kind = kind
        self.value = value
        self.prefix = ""

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After correcting the function, execute the failing test again to ensure that it passes. If the corrected function also needs to be tested with additional cases, run the test suite to identify any remaining issues with the function.
