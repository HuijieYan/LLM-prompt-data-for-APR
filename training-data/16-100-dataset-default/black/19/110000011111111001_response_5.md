The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of newlines and indentation. The function is expected to return the correct number of newlines and whether to add an indentation for the provided input. However, in some cases, it is not returning the expected values.

The failing test is asserting the equality of the expected and actual formatted strings, and it seems that there's a discrepancy in the number of newlines and indentation between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location in the function is likely the conditional statements that determine the number of newlines and the indentation.

To fix the bug, you can approach it by reviewing the conditional statements within the function to ensure that they correctly calculate the number of newlines and indentation. Also, consider incorporating the depth and type of the current and previous lines in the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly calculate the number of newlines and indentation and return the expected output for the given input parameters. This should address the failing test and ensure that the function works as intended.
