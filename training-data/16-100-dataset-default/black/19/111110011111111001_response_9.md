The bug in the function seems to be related to how it handles newlines and prefixes when processing different types of lines.

The function is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It takes into account various line properties such as depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the function is not handling the addition of newlines and prefixes correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the addition of newlines and prefixes based on the conditions defined within the function. This may involve revisiting the logic for determining the required number of newlines and ensuring that prefixes are correctly handled for different types of lines.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function should now properly handle the addition of newlines and prefixes based on the conditions provided in the failing test cases.
