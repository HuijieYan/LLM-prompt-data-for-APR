The issue with the provided code is that it contains multiple definitions of the `append` function and some other miscellaneous functions. Additionally, there is an undefined variable `Leaf` and `Tuple` in the signature of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

class Leaf:
    pass

class Line:
    pass

def fs(source: str) -> str:
    pass

class Black:
    @staticmethod
    def assert_equivalent(source: str, actual: str):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def assert_stable(source: str, actual: str, line_length: int):
        pass

def read_data(name: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    pass

class patch:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        pass

    def __enter__(self):
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, tb):
        pass

dump_to_stderr = None

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:

                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
            and (not self.is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
