1. The buggy function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, based on various conditions like depth, type of line (import, yield, flow control, decorator), and the previous line's attributes.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the type of the current and previous lines, as well as the depth of the current line.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect comparison conditions and logic in the function, leading to incorrect determination of the number of empty lines to be inserted.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the conditional statements to ensure they accurately capture the requirements for inserting empty lines.
   - Checking for any logical errors in the comparisons and conditions used in the function.
   - Ensuring that the function correctly handles different types of lines and their relationships with the previous line.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
