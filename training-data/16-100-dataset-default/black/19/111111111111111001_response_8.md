The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be not handling certain conditions correctly, resulting in an incorrect number of empty lines being returned.

The function appears to be part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is interacting with other functions in the same class to determine the number of empty lines. However, it seems that the logic within the function is not correctly considering all the possible cases, leading to unexpected results.

The failing test is indicating that the actual output of the function is not matching the expected output. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the input in certain cases, causing the mismatch.

To fix the bug, you could consider revisiting the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly considers all the possible conditions and combinations of inputs. Pay special attention to cases involving decorators, class definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

Here is an updated and corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_import:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0
    
    if current_line.is_yield:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

This corrected function should now handle the input conditions more accurately and provide the expected output for the failing test case.
