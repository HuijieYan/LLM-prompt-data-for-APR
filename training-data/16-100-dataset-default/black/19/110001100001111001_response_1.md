The bug in the function is due to incorrect logic when determining the number of newlines to insert before a line of code. This is due to a wrong calculation or assignment of the variable `newlines`.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Remove the unused variable `is_flow_control`.
2. Update the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on the conditions provided.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type, value):
        self.leaf_type = leaf_type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_decorator = any(leaf.value == '@' for leaf in self.leaves)
        self.is_def = any(leaf.value == 'def' for leaf in self.leaves)
        self.is_class = any(leaf.value == 'class' for leaf in self.leaves)
        self.is_flow_control = False  # Change this condition based on the actual identification of flow control statements
        self.is_import = any(leaf.value == 'import' for leaf in self.leaves)
        self.is_yield = any(leaf.value == 'yield' for leaf in self.leaves)

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        # Update the conditions to fix the logic for determining the number of newlines
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth) \
                or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases.
