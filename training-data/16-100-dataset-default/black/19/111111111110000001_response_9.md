The buggy function is a method called `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called within the `test_comment_in_decorator` function in the `BlackTestCase` test case.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to the logic that handles the insertion of empty lines based on different conditions such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and `is_flow_control`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines insertion based on the conditions mentioned above. Due to this incorrect handling, the actual output generated by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function does not match the expected output in the failing test, resulting in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines based on different conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 1
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
