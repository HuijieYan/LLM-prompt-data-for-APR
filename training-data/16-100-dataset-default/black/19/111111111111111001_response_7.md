The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug is likely to be in the logic that calculates the number of empty lines required.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is producing an assertion error because the expected and actual output strings do not match. This indicates that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not returning the correct number of empty lines.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the function is not handling the cases correctly when it comes to the number of empty lines to be inserted. This is likely due to incorrect handling of conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control statements.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be revised to properly account for the different scenarios when determining the number of required empty lines.

Here's a possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control statements and make sure the logic for calculating the number of empty lines is accurate.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles cases where empty lines should be inserted and where they should not be inserted.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` that should satisfy the failing test is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
This corrected function includes revised logic for handling different scenarios related to decorators, imports, flow control statements, and other conditions to ensure the proper calculation of the number of required empty lines.
