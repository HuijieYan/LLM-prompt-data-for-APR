The issue with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it is not returning the expected values based on the provided cases. The `newlines` value is expected to be returned in case 3, but it's not being calculated correctly, and `self.previous_defs` is expected to be updated, which is also not being done. Below is the corrected function that satisfies all the failing test cases:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from mymodule import Leaf, Line, BracketTracker

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line=None, previous_after=0, previous_defs=None):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs if previous_defs is not None else []
    
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
        newlines = 0
        before = 0
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        if self.previous_defs:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
                before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```
