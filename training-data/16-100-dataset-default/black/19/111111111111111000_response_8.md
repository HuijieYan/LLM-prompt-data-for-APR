The issue in the given buggy function seems to be the logic in the "_maybe_empty_lines" method. This method determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

Based on the failing test case and the expected cases, it appears that the logic to handle empty lines and the prefix of the first leaf is causing the discrepancies between the expected and actual results. 

To correct this, we need to refactor the logic to correctly account for the number of empty lines and the handling of the first leaf's prefix.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    comments: list
    bracket_tracker: object
    inside_brackets: bool
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: "Line") -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")

        else:
            before = 0

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version should properly handle the logic for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line while accounting for the presence of prefixes and distinct line types. This should address the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all test cases.
