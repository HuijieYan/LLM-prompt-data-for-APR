The potential error in the buggy function lies in the if-else structure where the mode is checked. The 'caffe' mode is not being handled properly and the 'torch' mode does not have the scaling and normalization logic.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the 'caffe' mode and add the scaling and normalization logic for the 'torch' mode.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        x -= [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        return x

    raise ValueError("Invalid mode. Supported modes are 'tf', 'torch', and 'caffe'.")
```

In the corrected code, the 'caffe' mode is handled properly by converting RGB to BGR and subtracting the ImageNet mean. The 'torch' mode now includes the scaling and normalization logic. Additionally, a ValueError is raised if an invalid mode is provided.
