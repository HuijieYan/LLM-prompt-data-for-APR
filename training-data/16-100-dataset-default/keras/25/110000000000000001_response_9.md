1. The buggy function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified data format and mode. However, it contains errors in the preprocessing steps and conditional statements.

2. The potential error lies in the conditional statements that handle the different modes for preprocessing the input array. There is inconsistency in the operations performed based on the mode.

3. The bug is caused by the inconsistent processing of the input array based on the specified mode. In the 'torch' mode, the mean and standard deviation values are calculated but not applied to the input array. Additionally, the conditional statement for 'caffe' mode also has inconsistencies in the processing.

4. To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be restructured to ensure consistent and correct preprocessing based on the specified mode. Additionally, the mean and standard deviation values should be correctly applied to the input array. 

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= mean
            if std is not None:
                x /= std
        else:
            x -= mean[::-1]
            if std is not None:
                x /= std[::-1]
        return x

    # for caffe mode or other unspecified modes
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    x -= mean
    return x
```

In the corrected code, the preprocessing steps for each mode are handled consistently based on the specified mode. Additionally, the mean and standard deviation values are correctly applied to the input array in the 'torch' mode.
