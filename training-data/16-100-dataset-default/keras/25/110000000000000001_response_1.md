1. The buggy function takes a Numpy array encoding a batch of images as input and preprocesses it based on the specified data format and mode.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the if-else statement that checks the value of the 'mode' parameter. 

3. The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'mode' parameter. The function currently only processes 'tf' and 'torch' modes, and for all other modes, it performs a different set of operations. This makes it unable to handle other modes as intended.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle all the different modes defined in the 'mode' parameter, including 'caffe'. Additionally, the function should also ensure that the preprocessing steps are applied correctly according to the specified data format.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = (x - mean[None, :, None, None]) / std[None, :, None, None]
        else:
            x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            # mean pixel for the ImageNet dataset
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x -= mean[:, None, None]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x -= mean
        return x
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles all the different modes including 'caffe'. The preprocessing steps also take into account the specified data format.
