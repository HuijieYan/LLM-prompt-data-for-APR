The issue in the provided function is that it is making changes to the input variable 'x' in place, leading to the error when trying to subtract the mean value, which is a list. To fix this issue, we can create a copy of the input 'x' at the beginning of the function so that any modifications are made to the copy rather than the original input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x)  # Create a copy of the input
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and scale by std
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if std is not None:
            x = (x - mean[:, None, None]) / std[:, None, None]
    else:
        if std is not None:
            x = (x - mean) / std

    return x
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by creating a copy of the input 'x' and ensures that array operations and modifications do not affect the original input. This should resolve the error and allow the function to work as expected.
