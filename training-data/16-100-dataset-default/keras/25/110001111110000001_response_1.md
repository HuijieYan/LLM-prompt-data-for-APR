The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is used to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images. It takes three arguments: `x` (the input array), `data_format` (the format of the image array), and `mode` (determines how the images will be preprocessed).

The failing test `test_preprocess_input` is testing the `preprocess_input` function, which internally calls `_preprocess_numpy_input`. The error message indicates that there is a `UFuncTypeError` in the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, which means there is an issue with subtracting values from the array `x` which is of type `int32`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the portion where the array `x` is being modified based on the `mode` and `data_format`. Specifically, when `mode` is 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last', the `x` array is directly modified without checking its type.

The cause of the bug is that the `x` array is of type `int32`, and when attempting to perform calculations on it with floating point numbers (in this case, the `mean` array), a `UFuncTypeError` is raised.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the `x` array is converted to a floating point type before performing any calculations. This can be done by explicitly converting `x` to a floating point type when the `mode` is 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last'.

Below is the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float before calculations
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # convert to float before calculations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # perform calculations on the floating point array
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

With this corrected code, the `UFuncTypeError` encountered in the failing test should be resolved, and the test should pass successfully.
