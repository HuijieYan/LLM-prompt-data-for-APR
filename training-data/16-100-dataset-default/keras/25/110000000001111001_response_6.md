The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else statement where the 'caffe' mode is handled. The mean and std variables are not being used to perform the required operations on the input array 'x'.

The bug's cause is that the 'caffe' mode was not properly handled in the else statement, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the 'caffe' mode should be handled properly by reversing the channels and subtracting the mean, and then the output should be returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        x -= mean
        return x
```
The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information for the provided cases.
