The bug in the function is that the 'caffe' mode is not implemented correctly. The function should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

The potential error is that the 'caffe' mode is not properly implemented, causing the function to return incorrect results in this mode.

The bug's cause is that in the 'caffe' mode, the function is not performing the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering of each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

To fix the bug, the 'caffe' mode implementation needs to be corrected to properly convert the images from RGB to BGR and zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(x.shape[-1]):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        for i in range(x.shape[-1]):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
    return x
```
