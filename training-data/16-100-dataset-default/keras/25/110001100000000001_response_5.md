Potential error location within the problematic function: 
The potential error lies in the conditional statements for 'tf' and 'torch' modes. In the 'tf' mode, the calculation of x and its return statement seems correct. However, in the 'torch' mode, the mean and std are calculated, but the values are not used to preprocess the input array 'x'. This indicates a potential bug in the 'torch' mode.

Bug's cause: 
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the 'torch' mode, where the mean and std are calculated but not applied to preprocess the input array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. In the 'torch' mode, the mean and std should be used to preprocess the input array 'x'.
2. Apply the calculated mean and std to the input array 'x' to normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
