The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is due to the mismatch of data types when performing operations on the array `x`. The error message indicates that it is not possible to cast the output of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`. This implies that the array `x` should be converted to a data type that can handle floating point numbers before performing the preprocessing operations.

To fix the bug, the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` needs to explicitly convert the input array `x` to a floating point data type, perform the preprocessing operations, and return the result with the correct data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Convert array to float32 data type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[:, None, None]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[:, None, None]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

With these modifications, the function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
