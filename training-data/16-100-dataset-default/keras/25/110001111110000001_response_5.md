The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is used for pre-processing Numpy arrays representing a batch of images in different modes such as "caffe", "tf", or "torch". The failing test `test_preprocess_input` is testing the pre-processing of both float and int image inputs. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` at line 82 of the `imagenet_utils.py`, indicating an issue with subtracting the mean value from the input array.

The potential error location is in the part of the function where it tries to subtract the mean value from the input array based on the data format.

The cause of the bug is that the input array is of type int32, and when subtracting the mean value (which is of type float64), there is a type casting error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to float before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_preprocess_numpy_input`:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
    (...)
    """

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            (...)
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            (...)
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        (...)
    else:
        x -= mean  # Subtract mean directly
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

By ensuring that the input array is converted to float before any operations, this corrected function should pass the failing test.
