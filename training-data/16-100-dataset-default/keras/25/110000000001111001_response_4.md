#### Bug identified:
The bug is caused by the implementation of the `if` condition for mode 'caffe', which does not apply the correct preprocessing steps. Instead, it calculates the expected values for the other modes, indicating wrong logic within the `if` statements.

#### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the 'caffe' mode correctly and does not apply the correct pre-processing steps for this mode. This leads to incorrect results when this mode is used.

#### Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement the correct pre-processing steps for the 'caffe' mode as described in the function's documentation.
2. Re-arrange the `if-else` logic to handle each mode separately and apply the respective pre-processing steps.

#### Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
