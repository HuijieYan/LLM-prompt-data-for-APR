The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not handle the datatypes of the input array properly. It tries to perform operations on the input array `x` without considering its datatype, leading to errors when it tries to subtract mean values from integer arrays.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations are performed on the input array `x` with the correct datatype.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure x is of type float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected code ensures that the input array `x` is converted to `float32` type and then the operations are performed on it accordingly.

The corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
