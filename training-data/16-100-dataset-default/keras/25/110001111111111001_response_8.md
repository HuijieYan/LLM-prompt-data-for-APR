### Analysis:

The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function seems to be caused by incorrect operations on the input array `x` based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. The incorrect data type mismatches are leading to errors during the processing of the input array.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect data type operations on the input array `x`. The error message indicates that the subtraction operation is resulting in a data type mismatch between `float64` and `int32`. This is likely due to the fact that the function is not handling the input array's data type appropriately.

### Possible Approaches:
1. Use numpy operations that respect the data type of the input array to avoid data type mismatches.
2. Ensure that the processing steps are consistent with the expected data type of the input array.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # ensure x is of type float32 for consistent processing

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

The corrected code ensures that the input array `x` is converted to `float32` type for consistent processing and handles the preprocessing steps with appropriate data type considerations.

With the corrections applied, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
