1. The buggy function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified data format and mode. However, there are potential issues with the calculations and conditional statements within the function that could lead to incorrect preprocessing.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statements for the 'torch' mode, where the mean and std values are calculated but not applied to the input array 'x'.

3. The bug's cause is that the mean and std values are calculated but not used to preprocess the input array for the 'torch' mode.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adding the calculation for preprocessing based on the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode.
   b. Ensuring that the calculations for each mode are correctly implemented and applied to the input array.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean
        return x
```
In the corrected code, the preprocessing for the 'torch' mode has been updated to include the mean and std calculations and application to the input array 'x'. Additionally, the conditional statements have been reorganized for clarity.
