1. The buggy function takes in a numpy array, a data format, and a mode, and preprocesses the numpy array based on the mode and data format.

2. The potential error location is within the 'else' statement where it calculates the mean and std values based on the mode and data format.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function calculates the mean and std based on the data format, but it does not properly handle the case where the mode is 'caffe'.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check for the 'caffe' mode and handle the mean and std calculations accordingly. Additionally, we can also refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
