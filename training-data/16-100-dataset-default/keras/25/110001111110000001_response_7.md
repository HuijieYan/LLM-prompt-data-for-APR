The issue with the buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` stems from the fact that the input `x` is of type `int32`, and the code attempts to perform floating point operations on it. This results in a UFuncTypeError when attempting to subtract a mean value from an integer array.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating point type before performing any mathematical operations. This can be achieved using the `astype` method to cast the array to float.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float first
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float first
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if x.dtype == 'int32':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float if still integer type

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the input array `x` is converted to float if it's of integer type before performing the necessary preprocessing steps, which will resolve the UFuncTypeError encountered in the failing test.
