1. The function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified data format and mode. However, there are some issues with the implementation of the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the conditional blocks for mode 'tf' and 'torch', as well as the calculation of mean and std values based on the data format.

3. The bug's cause is that the calculations for mean and std values are only being performed when the mode is 'torch', and the code for handling different data formats is not effectively applied.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the mean and std calculations are performed for all modes, not just 'torch'.
   - Properly handling different data formats to correctly preprocess the input Numpy array.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...] if x.ndim == 4 else x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```
