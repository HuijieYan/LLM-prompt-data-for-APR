The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect calculation of the preprocessed array based on the input mode. The mean values and standard deviation are not applied correctly, and the zero-centering and standardization is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculations for each mode so that the preprocessing is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x / 127.5) - 1.0
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
            else:
                x[:, :, 0, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, :, 1, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, :, 2, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the provided test cases and produce the expected output.
