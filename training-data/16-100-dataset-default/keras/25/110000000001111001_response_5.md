The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the 'caffe' mode. When in 'caffe' mode, it needs to convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly performing the necessary operations for the 'caffe' mode, which is resulting in incorrect output for that specific mode.

To fix the bug, we need to add the correct operations for the 'caffe' mode, including converting from RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel without scaling.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode == 'caffe':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        else:
            x[:, :, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, :, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, :, 2] -= mean[2]

    if std is not None:
        x /= std[0]

    return x
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
