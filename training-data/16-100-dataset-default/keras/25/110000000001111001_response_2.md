The bug in the function is that it doesn't correctly handle the 'caffe' mode as per the comments in the function. In the 'caffe' mode, the function is supposed to convert the images from RGB to BGR and zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

The bug is that the function doesn't implement this behavior for the 'caffe' mode. Instead, it goes into the 'else' block, which is only supposed to handle the 'caffe' mode.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly implement the behavior for the 'caffe' mode as per the comments in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x


    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the 'caffe' mode and produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
