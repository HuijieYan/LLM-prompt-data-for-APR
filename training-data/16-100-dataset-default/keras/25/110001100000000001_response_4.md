Potential error:
The potential error in the buggy function is that when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the code is not properly handling the data format and mean and std calculations, which can lead to incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is caused by not properly handling the data format and mean and std calculations when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input array and erroneous results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the data format and mean and std calculations for modes other than 'tf' or 'torch' to ensure correct preprocessing of the input array.
2. Use conditional statements to calculate mean and std based on the data format and mode.

Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected code:
1. The data format and mean and std calculations are properly handled for modes other than 'tf' or 'torch'.
2. Conditional statements are used to calculate mean and std based on the data format.
3. Simplified the code by removing redundant indexing and calculations.
