The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect handling of data type conversions. Specifically, when the `x` array is of type `int32`, the function tries to perform operations that require a floating-point data type, resulting in a type error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculations are performed in a consistent data type. We also need to address the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation steps, which were not applied correctly for the `channels_last` case.

Here is the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32 to ensure consistent data type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

The changes made to the code include:
1. Conversion of the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function to ensure a consistent data type for all operations.
2. Correction of the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation steps to be applied correctly for both `channels_first` and `channels_last` cases.
3. Use of `np.array` to create arrays for `mean` and `std` to ensure element-wise operations.

These changes will address the type error and ensure that the function operates correctly for both input data formats and modes.
