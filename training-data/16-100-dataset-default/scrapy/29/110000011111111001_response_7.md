The issue with the `request_httprepr` function is that it uses the `parsed.hostname` attribute without first checking if it exists. This causes a `NoneType` error which leads to the function failing.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before using it. If it does not exist, we can default to an empty string.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will check if `parsed.hostname` exists before using it, and default to an empty string if it doesn't. This should resolve the `NoneType` error and the function should now pass the failing test.
