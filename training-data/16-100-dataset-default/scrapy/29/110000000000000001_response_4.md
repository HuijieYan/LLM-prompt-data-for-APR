1. The buggy function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, there are multiple potential error locations that could be causing the issue.

2. One potential error location is the concatenation of the request body to the byte string 's'.

3. The cause of the bug is that the request body is directly concatenated to the byte string 's', which may result in a type error if the request body is not already in bytes format.

4. The bug can be fixed by explicitly converting the request body to bytes before concatenating it to the 's' byte string.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import urllib_parse, to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body) # Convert request body to bytes before concatenating
    return s
```
In the corrected code, we explicitly convert the request body to bytes using 'to_bytes' before concatenating it to the 's' byte string.
