The error is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is returning a `None` value in the `request_httprepr` function. The `to_bytes` function does not handle `None` values, which is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for it. We can modify the function to set the `parsed.hostname` to an empty string if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this change, the `parsed.hostname or ''` statement ensures that a default value of an empty string is used if `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This will prevent the TypeError that was previously occurring and should make the function pass the failing test.
