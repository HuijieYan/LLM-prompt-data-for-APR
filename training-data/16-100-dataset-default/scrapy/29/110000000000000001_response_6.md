The potential error in the buggy function is the misuse of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions. It seems that the `urlparse_cached` function is being used incorrectly, and the `urlunparse` function is not handling the input parameters properly. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `urlparse_cached` function and the incorrect handling of the parsed URL components using the `urlunparse` function.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `urlparse` function instead of `urlparse_cached`. Additionally, we need to construct the URL components properly before passing them to the `urlunparse` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = requests.Request(method=request.method, url=request.url).prepare().to_bytes()
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `urlparse` function to parse the URL components and then constructed the path using the `urlunparse` function. We have also used `requests` library to prepare the request and convert it to bytes before returning the raw HTTP representation.
