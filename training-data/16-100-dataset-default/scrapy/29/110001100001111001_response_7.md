The issue with the function `request_httprepr` is that it constructs the HTTP request incorrectly. The `Host` header is not formatted properly and the request method might not be appropriate in all cases.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly construct the `Host` header and use the correct path in the HTTP request line. Additionally, we should check for the `Host` in the `request.headers` and use it if present.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    host = request.headers.get('Host', parsed.netloc)
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the corrected code, the function constructs the HTTP request with the proper `Host` header and path, and checks for the presence of `Host` in the `request.headers` before using it. This should address the issues identified in the test cases.
