The issue appears to be happening because the `parsed.hostname` is None in Case 2 and the method `to_bytes` doesn't handle this case properly. To fix this, we can modify the `to_bytes` method to handle the NoneType correctly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from six import string_types

def to_bytes(text, encoding="utf-8", errors="strict"):
    """Return the binary representation of `text`. If `text` is already a bytes object, return it as-is."""
    if isinstance(text, bytes):
        return text
    elif isinstance(text, string_types):
        return text.encode(encoding, errors)
    elif text is None:
        return b''
    else:
        raise TypeError('to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got %s' % type(text).__name)


def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n" if parsed.hostname else b"Host: \r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, the `to_bytes` function now handles the case where `text` is None, and the test should pass without any errors.
