1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. It uses the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions to extract the path and the hostname from the request. It then constructs the HTTP request using the request method, path, and hostname, along with any headers and the body of the request.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the construction of the HTTP request string `s`, particularly when concatenating the various components.

3. The bug is causing an issue in the construction of the HTTP request string. This can be caused by incorrect concatenation of the different components, leading to an invalid HTTP request.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the concatenation of the request method, path, and hostname to ensure they are properly formatted.
   - Verify the addition of the headers and request body to the HTTP request string.
   - Confirm the encoding of the different components to bytes before concatenation.

5. Corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- The `to_bytes` function is used to encode the various components to bytes before concatenation.
- The header string is also converted to bytes using `to_bytes` before concatenation.
- The request body is checked for existence before appending to the HTTP request string.
