First, let's analyze the error message. It looks like the function `to_bytes` is receiving a `NoneType` argument, which causes the `TypeError`. This suggests that `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, which is then passed to `to_bytes`.

The issue lies in the `request_httprepr` function, specifically in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. 
The `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, and when passed to `to_bytes`, it raises a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can modify the code to check for the existence of `parsed.hostname` and fallback to an empty string if it's `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. The function should now pass the failing test.
