1. The buggy function request_httprepr takes a request as input and is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It uses the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions from an unknown module, as well as to_bytes function to convert strings to bytes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conversion of the request method and path to bytes, as well as in the handling of the request headers and body.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of the request method, path, headers, and body, leading to a wrong HTTP representation being generated.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Ensuring the request method and path are correctly converted to bytes.
   b. Properly handling the request headers and body to ensure they are included in the HTTP representation.
   c. Checking for any potential errors in the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_bytes() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, the request method and path are properly encoded to bytes using the encode method. The hostname from the parsed URL is also encoded to bytes. The request headers are converted to bytes using the to_bytes method and properly handled. This should resolve the issues present in the buggy function.
