1. The buggy function is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. It uses the urlparse_cached and urlunparse functions to parse the request URL and construct the path. It then appends the method, host, headers, and body to create the raw HTTP representation.

2. The potential error in the function lies in appending the request's body without checking if it exists.

3. The bug is caused by appending the request body without confirming its existence. If the request body is empty or None, it will result in a TypeError when trying to concatenate it with the rest of the HTTP representation. 

4. The bug can be fixed by checking if the request body exists before appending it to the raw HTTP representation. This can be done using an if statement to conditionally concatenate the request body.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += b"\r\n" + request.body
    return s
```
In the corrected code, I have added an if statement to check if the request body exists before appending it to the raw HTTP representation. This ensures that the code will not try to concatenate None with the rest of the HTTP representation, thus fixing the bug.
