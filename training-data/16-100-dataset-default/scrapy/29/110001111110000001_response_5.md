The error is occurring in the `to_bytes` function which is called within the `request_httprepr` function. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is None, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is None and prevent it from being passed to the `to_bytes` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from six import binary_type, string_types

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + (parsed.hostname or '').encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code handles the case when `parsed.hostname` is None by providing a default empty string. This prevents the `to_bytes` function from raising a TypeError. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
