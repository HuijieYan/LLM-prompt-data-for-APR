The issue in the `request_httprepr` function is with the `to_bytes` function, which is failing when trying to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes because its value is `None`. This is happening because for non-HTTP requests, the `parsed.hostname` is not always present.

To fix this, we should check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to add it to the byte string. If it's not present, we can skip adding the "Host" header.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as original_urlparse

def urlparse_cached(url):
    # a cached version of urlparse
    # implementation omitted for brevity
    pass

def urlunparse(parts):
    # implementation omitted for brevity
    pass

def to_bytes(text, encoding=None, errors='strict'):
    """Return the binary representation of `text`. If `text`
    is already a bytes object, return it as-is."""
    if isinstance(text, bytes):
        return text
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        raise TypeError('to_bytes must receive a str or bytes object, got %s' % type(text).__name__)
    if encoding is None:
        return text.encode('utf-8')
    return text.encode(encoding, errors)


def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code includes the check `if parsed.hostname:` to ensure that the "Host" header is only added if the hostname is present, thus resolving the issue observed in the failing test.
