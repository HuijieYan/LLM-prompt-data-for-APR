1. The buggy function is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. It extracts the necessary information from the request object, such as the method, path, headers, and body, and constructs the raw HTTP representation.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the way it handles the request headers and concatenates the various parts of the HTTP representation.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the request headers and the concatenation of the HTTP representation parts.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if the request has headers before attempting to access them
   - Ensuring proper encoding and concatenation of the components of the HTTP representation
   - Handling the request body properly

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlunparse, urlparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += to_bytes(header) + b": " + to_bytes(value) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```
In the corrected code, the urlparse function is used to parse the request URL, and the parts of the URL are properly concatenated to form the path. The headers are iterated through and properly concatenated with their values. Additionally, the request body is added to the raw HTTP representation. The code also uses the to_bytes function to ensure proper encoding of string data.
