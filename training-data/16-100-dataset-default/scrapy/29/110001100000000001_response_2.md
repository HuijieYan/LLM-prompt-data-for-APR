1. The problematic function `request_httprepr` is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. It uses other functions such as `urlparse_cached`, `to_bytes`, and `urlunparse`. It also manipulates the request object to construct the raw HTTP representation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the construction of the raw HTTP representation using the `s` variable, as well as in the handling of the request's headers and body.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect manipulation of the request data, such as the method, path, headers, and body. Additionally, if the related functions (`urlparse_cached`, `to_bytes`, `urlunparse`) are not returning the expected values, it could also lead to a bug in the `request_httprepr` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the values returned by the related functions to ensure they are correct, properly handling the request headers and body, and constructing the raw HTTP representation in a more robust way.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += header.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we make sure to properly encode the strings using `utf-8` encoding, properly construct the raw HTTP representation, handle the request headers, and append the request body only if it exists.
