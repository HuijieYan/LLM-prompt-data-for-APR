The bug in the function lies in the following line:

```
s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
```

The issue here is that it is hardcoding "HTTP/1.1" instead of using the HTTP version from the request. This causes incorrect HTTP representation in the returned value.

To fix the bug, the function should use the HTTP version from the request itself instead of hardcoding it. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" " + to_bytes(request._http11) + b"\r\n"  # Use the HTTP version from the request
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
