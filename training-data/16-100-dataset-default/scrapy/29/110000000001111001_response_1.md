The bug in the provided function is that it is creating the HTTP request string incorrectly. It is not properly formatting the "Host" header and is using the wrong scheme in the HTTP request line.

The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the "parsed.hostname" variable instead of using "parsed.netloc" to construct the "Host" header. Additionally, the function is using "http" as the scheme in the HTTP request line, instead of using the actual scheme from the URL.

To fix the bug, we need to use "parsed.netloc" to construct the "Host" header and use the correct scheme from the URL for the HTTP request line.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly construct the HTTP request string as expected.
