1. The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the PeriodIndex class. It seems to be related to the `is_monotonic` method in the Index class and is being called in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised due to the `NoneType` object not having an attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, specifically where the `self._engine_type` is being called since it seems to be returning a `NoneType` object.

3. The buggy function is being called during the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` and it seems to involve the `is_monotonic` method, which is raising an error due to the `self._engine_type` returning a `NoneType`. This indicates that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected engine type, resulting in the `NoneType` object being used in the subsequent `is_monotonic` method, leading to the AttributeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine type and does not return a `None` value. This could involve checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` method and ensuring that it returns a valid object.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas._libs.index import IndexEngine
import weakref

# Corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if isinstance(engine_type, IndexEngine):
        return engine_type
    else:
        # handle the scenario where _engine_type does not return a valid engine type
        raise ValueError("Invalid engine type returned by _engine_type method")
```

This corrected code checks if the `_engine_type` method returns a valid `IndexEngine` object, and if not, raises a ValueError indicating that an invalid engine type was returned. This should ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine type, preventing the `NoneType` error in the failing test.
