The potential error in the buggy function `_engine` is that it is not properly initializing the `PeriodEngine` object. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which leads to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function should be modified to properly initialize the `PeriodEngine` object with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type is not defined.")
```

With this modification, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will not be dropped prematurely, and the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`, resolving the AttributeError issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue as posted in the GitHub report.
