1. The buggy function is a cache_readonly decorator that is supposed to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex. The issue is related to weak references being dropped before they are intended to, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing an error when checking for monotonicity of the levels in a MultiIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) which is being used to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex. However, it seems that this weak reference is being dropped prematurely.

3. (a). The buggy function is trying to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex using weakref.ref(self).
   (b). The related functions are not explicitly mentioned, but it seems that the issue is related to how weak references are managed and how they interact with the PeriodEngine.
   (c). The GitHub issue details that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to an error when checking for monotonicity of levels.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the lifecycle of the weak reference and ensuring it is not being dropped prematurely.
   - Investigating how weak references are handled within the PeriodEngine and ensuring they are properly utilized.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected function uses functools.lru_cache instead of a custom cache_readonly decorator. It also creates a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and passes it to the _engine_type function as intended. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
