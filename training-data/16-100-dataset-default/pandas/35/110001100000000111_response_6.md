The buggy function is a method called `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. This method is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which implies that it is trying to cache the result of the function to optimize performance. The function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes that there is a problem with weak references being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior in a specific use case.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the creation and usage of the weak reference to `self`. It seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be managed properly to ensure that it is not being dropped before its intended use. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type` correctly and that it is being used in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.ref(self)` and passed to `_engine_type` as intended. This should ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
