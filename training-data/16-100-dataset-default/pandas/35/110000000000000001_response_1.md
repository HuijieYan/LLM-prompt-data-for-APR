1. The buggy function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` but this decorator is not defined in the given code.

2. The potential error is with the decorator `@cache_readonly` as it is not defined in the provided code.

3. The cause of the bug is the missing definition of the `@cache_readonly` decorator. This is likely intended to cache the value of `_engine` so that it is only computed once and then reused for subsequent calls.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the `@cache_readonly` decorator if it is a custom decorator being used in the code.
   - If the `@cache_readonly` decorator is a library or third-party decorator, then it should be imported and used in the code.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_value = None
    def wrapper(self):
        nonlocal cached_value
        if cached_value is None:
            cached_value = func(self)
        return cached_value
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
