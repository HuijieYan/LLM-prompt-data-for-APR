The issue in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference usage and the initialization of `self._engine_type`. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the `self._engine_type` is correctly initialized and returned. Also, instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, you can directly pass `self` as an argument to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the weak reference and ensure that the correct object is passed and initialized. This should fix the issue causing the AttributeError in the failing test.
