The buggy function `_engine` is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not a standard Python decorator. This is likely causing the issue with the function.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the `is_monotonic` property of the index, and the error message indicates that the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is trying to call the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. This suggests that there is an issue with the `_engine` function, which is the function we're trying to fix.

The expected input parameters are not directly reflected inside the provided function, but it is clear that the `self._values` and `self._engine_type` should be used to calculate the return value of the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug and satisfy the failing test, the usage of the non-standard decorator `@cache_readonly` needs to be removed. Additionally, the function needs to return a valid object that contains the required methods and properties like `is_monotonic_increasing`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return SomeValidEngineType(period, len(self))
```

Where `SomeValidEngineType` is the appropriate type or object that has the required methods and properties for the index used in the failing test.

This corrected code should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output variable information.
