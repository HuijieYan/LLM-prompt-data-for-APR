The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self, which is then passed to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference period is being assigned to a variable period, but not used in the subsequent call to `_engine_type`. This is likely the cause of the issue described in the GitHub issue, where the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the weak reference period should be used correctly when calling `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, `period()` is being called to access the weakly referenced object, and is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of self. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
