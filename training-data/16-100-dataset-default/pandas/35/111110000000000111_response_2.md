1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property within the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns the `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object, to avoid a reference cycle. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" is related to this function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference to `self`. It seems that the weak reference is getting dropped before it's intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a) The `cache_readonly` property `_engine` returns the `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object.
   (b) The `PeriodIndex` class is related to the problem as it contains the `_engine` function, and the GitHub issue is about preserving weakrefs in `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.
   (c) The GitHub issue information suggests that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it's intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function is not being dropped prematurely.
   - Check for potential issues with how weak references are being handled in connection with the `PeriodEngine` and `MultiIndex` levels.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is retained and passed to `_engine_type` to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
