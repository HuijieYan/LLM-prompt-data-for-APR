The issue is due to the `_engine_type` attribute not being properly initialized within the `_engine` function. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is None:
        # Initialize the _engine_type attribute if it is None
        self._engine_type = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_type
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `_engine_type` attribute is `None`, and if it is, we initialize it with `PeriodEngine(period, len(self))`. This ensures that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized before returning it in the `_engine` function.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
