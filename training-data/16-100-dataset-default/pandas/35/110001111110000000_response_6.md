# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

The code was corrected by importing the `PeriodEngine` class and using it to return a `PeriodEngine` instance in the `_engine` function. This should fix the AttributeError issue that was causing the failing test.
