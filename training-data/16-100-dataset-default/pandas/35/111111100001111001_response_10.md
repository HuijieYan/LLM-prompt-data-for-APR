The potential error in the `_engine` function is with the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. This is likely causing an issue with creating a weak reference to the `self` object.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the weak reference and call the `_engine_type` function directly with `self` and `len(self)` as parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
