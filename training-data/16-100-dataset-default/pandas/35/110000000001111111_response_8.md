The problem with the buggy function is that it is using weakref but the reference is not being stored properly. This leads to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, and the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref usage. The weak reference to self is not being stored or accessed properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the function should properly store the weak reference to self and access it when needed to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached'):
            self._cached = {}
        name = func.__name__
        if name not in self._cached:
            self._cached[name] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached[name]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly store the weak reference of self
    weak_ref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_ref_self, len(self._values))
```

This corrected code properly stores the weak reference to self and passes it to the _engine_type function. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
