1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is intended to return the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` without importing the `weakref` module.

3. The bug's cause is that the `weakref` module is not imported, which will result in a `NameError` when trying to use `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` method.

4. To fix the bug, the `weakref` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. This can be achieved by adding `import weakref` at the top of the file.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import weakref

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ...
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By importing the `weakref` module at the top of the file, the `NameError` will be resolved, and the `_engine` method should work as intended.
