The buggy function `_engine` is decorating with `@cache_readonly` indicating that it is a property getter method. It appears aimed at returning an instance of `self._engine_type` using weak reference of `self` as a period. However, there is a significant issue here as a weak reference should be created to the object, not to a value of the object (`period = weakref.ref(self)`). This can lead to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.

To solve this issue, it is necessary to obtain a weak reference to the instance itself. Additionally, the `period` argument used in creating `_engine_type` should not be the length of `self`, but the period itself.

However, as the exact implementation of `_engine_type` is not provided, we can only make assumptions. Assuming that `_engine_type` is taking the period and the length of `self`, the corrected code for the problematic function should look like this:

```python
import weakref

@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, self.freq)
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference is created to the instance itself, and the instance's period and frequency are passed to the `_engine_type` method. These changes should address the issue and align with the expectations outlined in the failing test. If the assumptions made about `_engine_type` are incorrect, further adjustments may be necessary after the exact role and usage of `self._engine_type` is clarified.
