The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type`, but it is incorrectly using the `weakref.ref` function. Additionally, the use of `period` as a variable is unnecessary and may lead to confusion. 

The potential error in the function is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. 

The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to directly pass the `self` object to `_engine_type` without using `weakref.ref`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
