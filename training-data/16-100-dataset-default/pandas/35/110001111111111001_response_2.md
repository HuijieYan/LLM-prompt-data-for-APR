The potential error in the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced properly or it might be pointing to a NoneType object when it is expected to be an actual object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced before being used to initialize the `_engine_type` object.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to directly dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can do this by using the `.im_self` attribute of the weak reference to access the original object it is referencing.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, we are directly dereferencing the weak reference `period` to access the original object it is referencing.

With this correction, the function should now properly initialize the `_engine_type` object without any 'NoneType' attribute errors. This should also resolve the failing test case.
