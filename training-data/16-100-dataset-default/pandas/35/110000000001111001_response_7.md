The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator. It seems that the intention of this decorator is to cache the result of the `_engine` function, but it's not implemented correctly.

The actual problem in the function is that it is trying to pass `self` as a weak reference to `_engine_type` but not using it correctly.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and use the `functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine` function. Additionally, we need to use the weak reference correctly when passing `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly return the expected output for the given input.
