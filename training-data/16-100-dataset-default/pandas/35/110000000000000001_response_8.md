1. The buggy function is a decorator called @cache_readonly that is applied to a function called _engine.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the cache_readonly decorator, which is not provided in the given code.

3. The cause of the bug is that the @cache_readonly decorator is not defined or imported in the given code, so the function is not properly decorated.

4. Two possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Define or import the @cache_readonly decorator and ensure that it properly handles the caching and readonly behavior.
   b. Remove the @cache_readonly decorator and simply call the _engine function as a regular method.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

# Defining a cache_readonly decorator
def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
