The `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class is expected to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but the actual implementation returns an instance of `PeriodArray` instead. This causes the failing test to throw an `AttributeError` because the `PeriodEngine` methods are being called on a `PeriodArray` object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` method should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of `PeriodArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(self)
```

With this correction, the method will return an instance of `PeriodEngine` as expected, which should resolve the AttributeError in the failing test.

This change will also satisfy the expected input/output variable information, as it ensures that the method returns the correct object type.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` method will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
