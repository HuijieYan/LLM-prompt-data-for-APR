The problem in the buggy function lies in the weak reference setup. The weakref usage is not correct, leading to a NoneType error in the failing test.

The failing test is checking the monotonicity of the levels in a MultiIndex created from PeriodIndex instances. However, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped earlier than intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex. This discrepancy in input/output variable values leads to the NoneType error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the weak reference setup needs to be revised to ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. It requires correcting the way the weak reference is formed and ensuring it's appropriately used to avoid premature dropping of the reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference correctly and hold the reference
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref(), len(self._values))
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is held in the `_period_ref` attribute, preventing it from being prematurely dropped. This approach addresses the issue reported in the failing test and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
