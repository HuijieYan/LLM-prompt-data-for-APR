The issue seems to be caused by the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is attempting to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it's intended to be used, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` method should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained until it's actually used to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it's used to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

By making this change, the `_engine` method should now function as intended, and the failing test should pass without raising the AttributeError.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
