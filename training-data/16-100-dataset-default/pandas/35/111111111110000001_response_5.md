1. The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class, which returns an instance of `_engine_type` using `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tests whether the `is_monotonic` property of a `PeriodIndex` is true. The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` method, where the creation of the `_engine_type` object from `self` is not returning the expected object, resulting in a `NoneType` instead.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the creation or initialization of the `_engine_type` object within the `_engine` method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` class and its initialization to ensure it returns a valid object. Additionally, ensuring that any weak reference usage is appropriate and not causing the object to be deallocated prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected code for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:  # Check that _engine_type returns a valid object
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type did not return a valid object")
```

This corrected code checks if the `_engine_type` object is not `None` and returns it. If it is `None`, it raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the `_engine_type` did not return a valid object. This should ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid `_engine_type` object, addressing the issue identified in the failing test.
