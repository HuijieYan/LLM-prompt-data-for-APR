1. The buggy function is a method within the PeriodIndex class. It is a cached readonly property that returns the value of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of the PeriodIndex instance and the length of the instance.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance. This is because weak references are used to avoid creating reference cycles, but in this context, it does not appear to be necessary.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the unnecessary use of weak references in the _engine method. It seems that the original intention may have been to prevent a reference cycle, but the context in which it is used does not warrant the use of weak references.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Removing the use of weak references and simply passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method.
   - Reviewing the intention behind using weak references and determining whether it is actually necessary in this context.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the use of weakref.ref and passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method, the bug is fixed. This simplifies the function and eliminates the unnecessary use of weak references.
