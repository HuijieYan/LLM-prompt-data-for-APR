1. The buggy function is a decorator function called "@cache_readonly" that is meant to cache the result of the "_engine" function to improve performance. However, there are a few issues with the implementation.

2. The potential error location is within the "@cache_readonly" decorator, as it's not implemented in the provided code.

3. The bug's cause is that the "@cache_readonly" decorator is missing, and there is also a potential issue with using weak references. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement the "@cache_readonly" decorator to properly cache the result of the "_engine" function.
   - Use a strong reference instead of a weak reference to avoid potential issues with weakrefs.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = func(self)
        return self._cache
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we've implemented the "@cache_readonly" decorator to cache the result of the "_engine" function. We've also removed the weakref and passed a strong reference "self" to the "_engine_type" function.
