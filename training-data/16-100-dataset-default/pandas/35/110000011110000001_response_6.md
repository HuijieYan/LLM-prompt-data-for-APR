1. The buggy function is a cached property function that is supposed to return the engine type based on the input. The failing test is related to the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `idx2.levels`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is on the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where the `_engine_type` may not be returning a valid object.

3. (a) The buggy function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it's supposed to store the result after the first call and return it on subsequent calls without computing it again. However, it seems that the caching mechanism is not working as expected and is returning a 'NoneType' object.

   (b) The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of `idx2.levels`, but this is causing an AttributeError because of a 'NoneType' object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

   - Checking the implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator to ensure it's correctly caching the result.
   - Verifying that the `_engine_type` class returns a valid object and is not returning `None`.
   - Ensuring that the correct parameters are being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    else:
        return engine
```
By adding the `if...else` check and raising a ValueError if `_engine_type` returns `None`, we ensure that the function does not return a 'NoneType' object. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
