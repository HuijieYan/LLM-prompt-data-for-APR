The buggy function being used in the failing test is a property decorator named `_engine`. The function uses a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle and then returns the result of initializing a class attribute `_engine_type`. The failing test attempts to assert whether `idx2` (a `MultiIndex` object) has monotonic levels, but it encounters an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is where the function is returning a result that is leading to the 'NoneType' attribute error, which implies that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning a `NoneType`.

The bug's cause seems to be that the `_engine` function is not returning a valid object of the expected type, causing the attribute errors when the failing test tries to access properties of that object. This could be due to an issue with the initialization of `self._engine_type` or due to weak reference not being properly created.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that it returns a valid object of the expected type. This might involve checking the initialization of `self._engine_type` or the weak reference creation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```
In this corrected version, an additional check is placed using `if self._engine_type is not None` before returning the result of `_engine_type`. This guards against potential `NoneType` errors.
