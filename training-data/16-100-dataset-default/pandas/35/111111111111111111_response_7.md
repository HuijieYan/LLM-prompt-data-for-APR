The bug is in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, which returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`. The function is currently not returning the correct object due to a weak reference issue.

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference object `period` not being properly utilized. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This is causing an `AttributeError` when the `view` method is called on the `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference object `period` needs to be properly used in the `_engine` function to avoid losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. 

The corrected code for the `_engine` function can be as follows:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Calling the weak reference object to get the PeriodIndex object
```

With this corrected code, the weak reference issue will be resolved and the function will return the correct object.

By making this correction, the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is expected to pass and the error message related to the weak reference issue should be resolved.

GitHub Issue Title:
BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs

GitHub Issue Description:
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This causes the error. The expected output should return True.

The corrected code should address the weak reference issue and resolve the problem as described in the GitHub issue.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Calling the weak reference object to get the PeriodIndex object
```
With this corrected code, the weak reference issue will be resolved and the function will return the correct object.
