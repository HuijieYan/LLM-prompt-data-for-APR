1. Analyzing the code, it seems like the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning an instance of `_engine_type` with incorrect arguments, leading to the AttributeError. The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute from the `idx2.levels`, which indirectly involves invoking the `_engine` function, causing the error to occur.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that returns the `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. This seems to be the cause of the issue.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function returning an instance of `_engine_type` with incorrect arguments. As a result, the failing test is unable to access the `is_monotonic` attribute from `idx2.levels`, leading to the AttributeError seen in the error message. The issue is primarily seen in how the `_engine` function is invoked and the returned instance of `_engine_type`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the `_engine` function to return the correct instance of `_engine_type` with the appropriate arguments.
   - Ensuring that the arguments passed to the `_engine_type` instance are valid and compatible with the expected behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self), self.freq)
```

In this corrected code, the `period_weakref` is created by using the `weakref.ref` method to avoid reference cycles. The `self.freq` is also passed to the `_engine_type` to ensure all necessary arguments are provided.
