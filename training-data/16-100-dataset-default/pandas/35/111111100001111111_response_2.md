The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly, which is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended.

The bug is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be used properly to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly using weak reference to avoid the dropping of the PeriodIndex
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` rather than `weakref.ref(self)`, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and produce the expected output for the failing tests.
