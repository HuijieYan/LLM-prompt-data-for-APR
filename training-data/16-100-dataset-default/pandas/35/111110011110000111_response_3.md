The cause of the bug is in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is likely related to the weakly referenced `period` variable within the `_engine` function.

In the failing test, when constructing `idx2`, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is not properly maintained, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue highlights the dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely within the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine: Weak reference to 'self' is no longer valid")
```

This updated code checks if the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not `None` before returning the engine. If it's `None`, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that the weak reference to 'self' is no longer valid.

This fix ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained and prevents the `None` value from being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
