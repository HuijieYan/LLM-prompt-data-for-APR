The issue seems to be that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct value and type as per the expected output. The error message indicates that the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line is causing an AttributeError, specifically that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected object type.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct object type. It appears that the `_engine` function should return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which should resolve the AttributeError and allow the failing test to pass.

By returning an instance of `PeriodEngine`, the corrected `_engine` function now satisfies the expected output for the specified input parameters. Therefore, the corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
