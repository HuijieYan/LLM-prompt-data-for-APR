1. The buggy function is a cache_readonly decorator function that is supposed to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex class. It is supposed to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object and then return the engine type with the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is not being created properly, which can lead to potential reference cycle issues and incorrect behavior of the engine type.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have added the "import weakref" statement to ensure that the weak reference is properly created. The weakref.ref() function creates a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object "self", which will prevent potential reference cycle issues and ensure the correct behavior of the engine type.
