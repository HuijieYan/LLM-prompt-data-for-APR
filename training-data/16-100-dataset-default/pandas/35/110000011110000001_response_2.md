The buggy function is a property decorator that is used to cache the value of the `_engine` property. It is a part of the `MultiIndex` class and is causing an error when the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test is run. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` as the `'NoneType'` object has no attribute `view`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` function is not returning a valid object and is potentially returning `None`, leading to the 'NoneType' object error.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` property should be updated to properly handle the creation of the engine type and ensure that it does not return `None` unexpectedly. This may involve checking the validity of the inputs, error handling within the `_engine_type` function, or making sure that the necessary prerequisites for creating the engine are met.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is not None:
            self._cached_engine = engine
    return self._cached_engine
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the engine has already been cached. If it hasn't, we proceed to create the engine using the `_engine_type` and store it in the `_cached_engine` attribute. We also ensure that the engine is not `None` before caching it. This approach will ensure that the engine is properly created and stored, preventing any 'NoneType' errors.
