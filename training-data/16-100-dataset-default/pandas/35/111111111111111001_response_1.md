The buggy code is located in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `NoneType` object having no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid object.

The problem seems to be with the use of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not being properly resolved, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` method without using `weakref`. This will ensure that a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained, and the weak reference issue is resolved.

This correction should address the error identified in the failing test and ensure that the `idx2` object has valid `is_monotonic` levels.
