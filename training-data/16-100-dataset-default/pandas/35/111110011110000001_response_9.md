1. The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. This class is used to create an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is using the `PeriodIndex` class to create a MultiIndex and check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where it seems that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_engine` method is expecting `_engine_type` to return a specific object, but it is returning `None`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct object type, ensuring that it does not return `None`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid _engine_type result")
```

By implementing this change, the `_engine` method will check if the result from `_engine_type` is not None, and if it is, it will raise a ValueError. This ensures that the method does not return `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
