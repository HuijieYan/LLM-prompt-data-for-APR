The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems to be related to weak referencing since it uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic, but it fails with an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the weak reference is being dropped before intended.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides a more detailed explanation of the problem. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is checked before creating the `_engine_type` object, ensuring that it does not receive a `None` when the weak reference is dropped prematurely. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
