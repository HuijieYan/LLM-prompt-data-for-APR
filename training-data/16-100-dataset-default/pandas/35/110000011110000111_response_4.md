The problematic function is a method called _engine, which is a property method marked with @cache_readonly decorator. This method returns self._engine_type(period, len(self)). The failing test function calls this method indirectly through idx2.levels, and it raises an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. 

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely before it gets passed to the PeriodEngine.
2. Checking the handling of weakrefs within the _engine_type method.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from weakref import ref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_value'):
            self._cached_value = func(self)
        return self._cached_value
    return wrapper

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

# ensure that the weakly referenced self is properly dereferenced before passing to _engine_type
```

In the corrected code, we are using weakref.ref to create a weak reference to the self object and then passing that weak reference to the _engine_type method. This ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely before being used in the _engine_type method, fixing the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
