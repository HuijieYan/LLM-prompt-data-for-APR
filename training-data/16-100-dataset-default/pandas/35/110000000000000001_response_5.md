1. The buggy function is a decorator called "@cache_readonly" applied to the "_engine" function. The "_engine" function is attempting to return a value based on the "self" object and some properties of it.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the "weakref.ref(self)" statement. It seems that the intention is to create a weak reference to the "self" object to avoid a reference cycle, but the usage is incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used correctly, and it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to properly use the weak reference to the "self" object within the "_engine" function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the "weakref.ref(self)" statement has been replaced with "weakref.proxy(self)" to properly create a weak reference to the "self" object. Additionally, a decorator function "cache_readonly" has been defined to handle the caching of the result.
