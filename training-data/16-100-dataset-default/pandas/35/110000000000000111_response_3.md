1. The buggy function is a property with a decorator `@cache_readonly` that is attempting to return the engine type for a given period. The GitHub issue is related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the weakref usage, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description, where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended.

3. The bug's cause is the weakref usage within the `_engine` function. The weakref is not being used correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Approach for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weakref is being properly used to reference the `self` object within the `_engine` function.
   - Validate that the weakref holds a reference to `self` for the entire duration of its usage within the `_engine` function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    return property(func)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that a weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the usage within the `_engine` function, resolving the weakrefs issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
