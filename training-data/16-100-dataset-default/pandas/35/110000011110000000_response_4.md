The issue in the given code is that the `@cache_readonly` decorator is missing, which is causing the failing test. The corrected version with the `@cache_readonly` decorator added is provided below:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Adding the `@lru_cache` decorator will fix the issue and the failing test should now pass.
