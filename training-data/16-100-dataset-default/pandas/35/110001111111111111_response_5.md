The buggy function `_engine` is a property that returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class with the period and the length of the current object. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex and check if the level values are monotonic, but it fails with an AttributeError related to a weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

The error message indicates that the `_do_monotonic_check` method in `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` is attempting to access the values of the weakly referenced object, which results in a `NoneType` object and raises an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the weak reference is lost before the intended usage, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed instead.

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self` and then use that weak reference when instantiating the `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the weakly referenced object is not dropped before it is intended to be used.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_ref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weak_ref_self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced object will be maintained until it is properly used in the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
