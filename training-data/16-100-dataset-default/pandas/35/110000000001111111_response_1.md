The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the self object. However, it seems that this weak reference is being dropped before the engine type is created, resulting in the function receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until the engine type is created. One approach to fix this bug is to modify the function to store the weak reference as an attribute of the self object, ensuring that it stays alive as long as the self object is alive.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self as an attribute
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref(), len(self))
```

This modification should ensure that the weak reference to self remains alive until the engine type is created, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
