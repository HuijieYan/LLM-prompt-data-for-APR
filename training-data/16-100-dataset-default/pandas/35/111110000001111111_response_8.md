Analysis:
The `_engine` function is intended to return a weakref of the `PeriodIndex` class to be used in the `_engine_type` constructor. However, it's not being implemented correctly, leading to the weak reference getting lost. This is causing issues in other parts of the code, as described in the GitHub issue.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly within the `_engine` function. This results in the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance using the `weakref.ref()` function.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the lifespan of the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub report and maintain the weak reference as intended.
