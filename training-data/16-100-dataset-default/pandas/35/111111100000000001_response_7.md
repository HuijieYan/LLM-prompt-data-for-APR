Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is with the use of the `cache_readonly` decorator. It seems like the intended purpose of the `_engine` function is to create and return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, but the implementation is incomplete and unclear.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function `_engine` attempts to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, but it does not seem to be properly implemented.
(b). The buggy class `PeriodIndex` contains the `_engine` function, which is responsible for creating an instance of the `_engine_type` class.
(c). The related functions are not provided, but it is likely that there is a missing implementation in the `_engine` function that prevents it from creating the necessary instance of `_engine_type`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Complete the implementation of the `_engine` function to properly create and return an instance of the `_engine_type` class.
2. Ensure that all necessary parameters and attributes are properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.
3. Check for any missing imports or dependencies that may be required for the `_engine_type` class.

Corrected Code:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    (existing class implementation)
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period=period, length=len(self))  # Corrected implementation
```

In the corrected code, the `_engine` function now properly creates and returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing the necessary parameters `period` and `length` to the constructor of `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
