The problem lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then using it to create a new `PeriodEngine` object. However, the weak reference is not being maintained, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a reference to `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where weak referencing is expected to be maintained, but due to the bug in the `_engine` function, it is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` when creating the `PeriodEngine` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` when creating the `PeriodEngine` object, the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
