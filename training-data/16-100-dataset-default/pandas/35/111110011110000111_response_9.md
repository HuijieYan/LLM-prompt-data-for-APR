The problematic function is the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a None object instead of the expected PeriodEngine object.

The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference used in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is intended to prevent a reference cycle, but the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `_engine` function to receive a None object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` by keeping it alive until the `PeriodEngine` object is created.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self to keep it alive
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is replaced with a strong reference, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` is kept alive throughout the `_engine` function, thus resolving the issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
