Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug is caused by the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to `self` (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) is being lost before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To address this issue, one possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained. This can be accomplished by storing `self` as a weak reference in a class attribute, rather than a local variable in the function.

Additionally, updating the `PeriodIndex` class to properly maintain the weak reference to itself within the `_engine` function will resolve the issue.

Finally, the corrected code for the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store self as a weak reference in a class attribute
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By making these changes, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
