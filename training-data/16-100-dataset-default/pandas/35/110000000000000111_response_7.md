1. The buggy function is a property called _engine, which is intended to return a weakly referenced PeriodIndex. The GitHub issue is related to weakrefs being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is directly related to the problem described in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) call, which is used to create a weak reference to the self object (PeriodIndex).

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to return a weakly referenced PeriodIndex.
   (b) According to the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is resulting in the observed error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is handled and maintained properly within the _engine function.
   - Verifying the logic of how the weak reference is being used and ensuring that it is not being dropped prematurely.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we have added a wrapper function for the cache_readonly decorator to ensure that the caching behavior is maintained. We are also using weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the self object and returning it in the _engine function. This should address the issue of the weak reference being dropped prematurely and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
