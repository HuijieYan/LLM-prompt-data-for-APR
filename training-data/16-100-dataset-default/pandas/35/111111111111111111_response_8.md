Potential error location: 

The issue seems to be in the `_engine` function, particularly with the weak reference usage in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

Bug's cause:

The bug appears to be caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it was intended. Consequently, the PeriodEngine is receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Approach for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
2. Verify that the PeriodEngine is receiving the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if period() is None:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex was lost")
    return engine
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until the engine instance is created. If the weak reference is lost before this, an exception is raised.
