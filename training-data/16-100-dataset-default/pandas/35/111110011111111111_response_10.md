The bug is caused by the PeriodIndex weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None value instead of the PeriodIndex. This results in an AttributeError when the engine tries to access the view attribute of the NoneType object.

To fix this bug, the _engine method in the PeriodIndex class needs to be modified to properly handle the weak reference to self.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self is properly maintained, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
