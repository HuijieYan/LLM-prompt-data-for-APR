The issue seems to stem from a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `None` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, and that it is properly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

Here, we are making sure to use the `self._data` instead of `len(self)` to pass the weakref of the `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

This fix should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
