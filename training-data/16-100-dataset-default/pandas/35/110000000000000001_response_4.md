1. The buggy function is a decorator called "@cache_readonly" that is applied to the "_engine" method of a class. The function is supposed to return the result of creating an instance of "_engine_type" with some parameters. However, there are some issues with the implementation.

2. The potential error location is the use of the "@cache_readonly" decorator, which is not a built-in decorator in Python. This may cause the function to not work as intended.

3. The cause of the bug is that the "@cache_readonly" decorator is not a standard Python decorator, and it's not clear what it's supposed to do based on the provided code. Additionally, the use of weakref.ref() is not necessary and may be causing unintended behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we can remove the "@cache_readonly" decorator and simply return the result of creating an instance of "_engine_type" with the required parameters. We can also remove the weakref.ref() part as it doesn't seem to serve any purpose based on the provided code.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
