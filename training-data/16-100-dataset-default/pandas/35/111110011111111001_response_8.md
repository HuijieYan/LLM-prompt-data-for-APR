The issue with the `_engine` function is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. However, `self._engine_type` is likely to be `None` when this is executed and this causes an error when the `vgetter()` method is called on `NoneType`. 

The function `_engine` should be modified to handle this situation by checking if `self._engine_type` is `None` before attempting to create an instance of it.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return None
```

With this modification, the function will no longer attempt to create an instance of `self._engine_type` if it is `None`, avoiding the error that occurred in the failing test.
