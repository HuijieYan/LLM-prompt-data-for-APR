The bug seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` module, which is used in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test case in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` module.

The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file, which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

The `_engine` function seems to be related to the `PeriodEngine` class, and the failing test is checking for monotonicity of different levels in the index, which requires the correct implementation of the `_engine` function.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is likely the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where the `_engine_type` method might not be returning the correct type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct type, which is likely to be an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class with the appropriate arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This corrected code should ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which should resolve the AttributeError in the failing test case.
