The buggy function `_engine` appears to be creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, which then uses the weak reference to access attributes of `self`. However, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, causing `None` to be passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the AttributeError in the failing test.

The function `_engine` is the only relevant code provided, and it seems that the issue lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being handled within this function. The failing test attempts to access attribute `is_monotonic` on an `idx2` object, which ultimately leads to the AttributeError due to a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped too soon.

Based on the GitHub issue description, the problem seems to be related to weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This aligns with the observed behavior and the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference within the `_engine` function and passing it to `_engine_type` only when needed, instead of passing the weak reference directly to `_engine_type`. This would prevent the weak reference from being dropped prematurely.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function can be as follows:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type when needed
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is maintained and passed to `_engine_type` using a lambda function when it is needed. This should ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
