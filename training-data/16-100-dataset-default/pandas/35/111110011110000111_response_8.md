Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function, as the error message points to an AttributeError related to accessing the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine` function might be returning `None` instead of the expected object.

Bug's Cause:
The `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the weak reference to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.
2. Check the instantiation of `_engine_type` to ensure it is returning the expected object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is not None:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine instance")
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly handled, and it is checked whether the `_engine_type` instantiation returns a valid object. If it does not, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate the failure.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
