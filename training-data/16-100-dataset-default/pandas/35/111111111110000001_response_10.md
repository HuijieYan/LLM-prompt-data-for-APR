1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object not having an attribute 'view'. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to this bug, and it involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `self._engine_type` might be returning a 'NoneType' object.

3. The bug causes the `_engine` function to return a 'NoneType' object, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute. This is likely due to an issue in the initialization or assignment of `self._engine_type`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of `self._engine_type` to ensure it is returning a valid object.
   - Debug the initialization and assignment of `self._engine_type` to make sure it is set correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is not None:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine instance cannot be None")
```

With this corrected function, the `self._engine_type` instantiation is checked to ensure it is not None, and an appropriate error will be raised if it is. This should solve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
