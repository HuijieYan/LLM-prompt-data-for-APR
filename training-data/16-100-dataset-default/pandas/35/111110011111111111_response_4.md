The problem with the given function `_engine` is that it's returning `None` instead of the expected result. This causes an error when trying to access the `view` attribute on the `None` object.

The issue seems to be related to weakrefs and the dropping of the PeriodIndex before it's intended to be. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this, the `_engine` function needs to properly create a weakref to the PeriodIndex and return the engine type with the weakref and length as parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._engine_data))
```

In this corrected code, we are passing `self._engine_data` instead of `len(self)`. This ensures that the weakref to the PeriodIndex is properly created and passed to the engine type to avoid the reference cycle issue.

With this correction, the function should now return the PeriodEngine type with the weakref and length as parameters, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.

This correction should address the problem described in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
