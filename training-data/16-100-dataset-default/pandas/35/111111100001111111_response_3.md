The issue here seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex object. The `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type`, which takes the PeriodIndex object and its length as parameters. However, the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained correctly, leading to the `_engine_type` receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex object.

The source of the problem lies in the weak referencing mechanism used within the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly stored and maintained, leading to the reference being dropped prematurely.

To resolve this issue, one possible approach could be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored and maintained within the `_engine` function. This could involve using the `weakref` module more effectively to create and manage the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function could be as follows:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
In this corrected code, we are creating a weak reference to the `self` object and passing it to the `_engine_type` along with the length of the `_values` attribute. This should ensure that the weak reference is maintained as expected and prevent the issue described in the GitHub problem.

This correction should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
