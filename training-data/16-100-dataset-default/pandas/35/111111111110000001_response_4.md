1. The problematic function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class, which is a subclass of `Int64Index`. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` and then calls `is_monotonic` on an instance of `PeriodEngine` within the failing test. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` instance does not have the attribute `view`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the return statement: `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. (a). The problematic function `_engine` does not seem to be returning an instance of `PeriodEngine` correctly.
   (b). The class `PeriodIndex` inherits from `Int64Index` and includes an attribute `_engine_type` that is meant to return an engine for performing calculations.
   (c). The failing test creates an instance of `PeriodIndex` and attempts to use the engine to check for monotonicity, which results in the error message indicating a missing attribute.
   (d). The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` demonstrates that the `PeriodEngine` does not have the attribute `view` when the function `is_monotonic` is called.

4. To fix the bug, the return statement in the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that it properly returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the correct attributes.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if isinstance(engine, PeriodEngine):
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid engine type")
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function checks if the returned engine is an instance of `PeriodEngine` before returning it. This ensures that the correct engine type is returned and should address the attribute error encountered in the failing test.
