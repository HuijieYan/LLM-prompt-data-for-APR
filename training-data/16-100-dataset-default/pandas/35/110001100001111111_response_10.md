The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it's supposed to. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. The problem is likely in the way the weak reference is being handled.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling the weak reference object with `period()`, we obtain the referenced object and pass it to the _engine_type function. This ensures that a valid reference to the PeriodIndex is passed to the PeriodEngine.

With this change, the issue reported in the GitHub description should be resolved and the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
