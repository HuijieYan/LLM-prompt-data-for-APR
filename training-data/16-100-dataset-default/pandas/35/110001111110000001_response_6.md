The buggy function is a method called _engine within the period.py file of the pandas library. This function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle and return a type of _engine_type. The failing test related to this function is trying to get the level values when dealing with periods and it is raising an AttributeError with a message 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The potential error location within the function is with the weak reference usage and the return of self._engine_type(period, len(self)). This is likely where the 'NoneType' object is being returned, leading to the AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference usage might not be working as intended and the _engine_type might not be returning the expected type of object, leading to a 'NoneType' object being returned.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to revise the usage of weak reference and ensure that it is correctly referencing the object needed. Additionally, the _engine_type might need to be checked to ensure that it is returning the expected type of object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In this corrected code, we are ensuring that the weak reference is correctly created and used, and that the return from _engine_type is called as a function, ensuring that the correct type of object is returned. This should resolve the AttributeError and make the function pass the failing test.
