1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type`, which is based on a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, along with the length of the index. The function is used to avoid a reference cycle and prevent memory leaks.

The GitHub issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` resulting in the loss of weakrefs. This is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is likely in the weak reference creation and usage, as well as the return statement.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which describes the expected behavior of the weak reference not being met.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `_engine` method. This may involve revisiting the use of weakref and ensuring that the reference to `self` is kept alive until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is created and used properly. This should address the issue described in the GitHub report, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained as intended.
