Analyze:

The buggy function `_engine` is a method in the PeriodIndex class. It returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weakref of self and the length of the PeriodIndex. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the `is_monotonic` property of the levels in a MultiIndex, which utilizes the `_engine` method. The error message indicates an AttributeError, specifically that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being handled properly.

GitHub Issue:

The GitHub issue describes the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType instead of the PeriodIndex. The expected output is for the test to return True.

Bug Cause:

The cause of the bug is that the weakref of the PeriodIndex is not being handled properly within the `_engine` method, leading to a NoneType object being passed to the PeriodEngine.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Ensure that the weakref of the PeriodIndex is being properly handled within the `_engine` method.
2. Verify that the weak reference is maintained until it's no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.
3. Update the implementation of `_engine` to handle the weakref more effectively.

Corrected Code:

```python
import weakref

# Corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

By checking if `_engine_type` is not None, and returning None if it is, we can handle the weak reference of the PeriodIndex more effectively. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
