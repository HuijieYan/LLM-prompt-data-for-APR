The bug is caused by the weak reference to self being dropped before the intended time, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until the appropriate time.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to store the weak reference to self and then use it to create the PeriodEngine. This will ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this change, the weak reference to self will be maintained until it is used to create the PeriodEngine, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
