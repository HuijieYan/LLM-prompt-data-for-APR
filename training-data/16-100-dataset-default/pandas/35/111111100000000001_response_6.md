Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the _engine function is the weakref.ref(self) call, which is used to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that weakref.ref(self) creates a weak reference to the object, which may not be necessary in this context. Additionally, the use of weakref.ref(self) without storing it in a variable means that the weak reference will be immediately discarded, rendering it ineffective.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the weakref.ref(self) call and simply pass self to the _engine_type function, as creating a weak reference may not be necessary in this context.
2. If a weak reference is indeed necessary, store the weak reference created by weakref.ref(self) in a variable so that it is not immediately discarded.

Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
