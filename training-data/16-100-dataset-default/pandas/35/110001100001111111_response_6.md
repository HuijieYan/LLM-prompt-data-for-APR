The buggy function is a method from the pandas library called `_engine` and it is decorated with `@cache_readonly`. This function is supposed to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being created properly.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes a problem with weakly referenced PeriodIndex which is dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is that the weak reference to `self` is not being created correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self`. After creating the weak reference, we can then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference and the length of self to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly created and passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
