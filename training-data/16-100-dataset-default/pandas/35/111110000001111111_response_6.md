The bug is likely located in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class, specifically in the weakref.ref(self) line. The issue arises from dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object should be properly created so that it is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the weak reference to the self object is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters remain unchanged)

    Methods
    -------
    asfreq
    strftime
    to_timestamp
    
    ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    """

    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By making sure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed, the corrected code ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
