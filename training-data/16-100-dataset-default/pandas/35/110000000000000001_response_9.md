1. The buggy function is a decorator called `@cache_readonly` that is meant to memoize the result of the `_engine` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the missing definition or implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator.

3. The bug's cause is that the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not defined or implemented in the provided code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define and implement the `@cache_readonly` decorator to properly memoize the result of the `_engine` function.
   - Use a built-in memoization method such as `functools.lru_cache` instead of creating a custom decorator.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import functools

def cache_readonly(func):
    memo = {}
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        if self not in memo:
            memo[self] = func(self)
        return memo[self]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, a `cache_readonly` decorator is defined and implemented to memoize the result of the `_engine` function. The `functools.wraps` is used to preserve the metadata of the original function.
