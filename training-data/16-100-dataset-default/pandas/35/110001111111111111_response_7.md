The issue is related to weak referencing not being properly handled in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError when accessing the view attribute.

To fix this bug, the weak reference of the self object needs to be properly handled within the _engine function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the weakref module to create a weak reference to the self object and then use it within the _engine function to create the PeriodEngine object.

The corrected code for the _engine function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the self object is properly utilized within the _engine function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
