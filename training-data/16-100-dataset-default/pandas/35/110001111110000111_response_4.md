1. The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a PeriodIndex instance. The weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the PeriodIndex. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic, but it raises an error indicating that the PeriodEngine gets a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the creation of the weak reference to `self`. The weak reference is not being used correctly and it leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

3. The bug is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended to be. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` checks if all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic, but it raises an error because the PeriodEngine receives a `None`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the way the weak reference is created and used to ensure it is not dropped prematurely.
   - Ensure that the PeriodIndex is properly maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function to avoid it being replaced with a `None`.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By using the `ref` function to create a weak reference to the `self` object, we can ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and that the PeriodEngine receives the intended reference. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and the failing test.
