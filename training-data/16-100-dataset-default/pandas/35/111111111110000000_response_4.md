To fix the buggy function, the `_engine` method needs to return a new instance of the `PeriodEngine` class instead of returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type()
```

With this correction, the `_engine` method will correctly create a new instance of the `PeriodEngine` class and return it. This should address the AttributeError that was encountered in the failing test.
