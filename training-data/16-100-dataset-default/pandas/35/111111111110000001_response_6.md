1. The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object that does not have the attribute `view`. This suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected type of object.

2. The potential error location within the `PeriodIndex` class is the `_engine` function, where it returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is where the incorrect object type is being returned.

3. The cause of the bug is likely an issue with the `_engine_type` method or how it is being utilized in the `_engine` function. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to access the `is_monotonic` attribute, but this fails due to the incorrect type being returned from the `_engine` function.

4. To fix the bug, potential approaches could include reviewing the implementation of the `_engine_type` method and ensuring that it returns the correct type of object. Additionally, the `_engine` function should be modified to handle the result of `_engine_type` appropriately.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return result
```
