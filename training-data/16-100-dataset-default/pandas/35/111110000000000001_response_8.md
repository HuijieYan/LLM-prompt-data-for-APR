The buggy function is part of the PeriodIndex class and is meant to create an instance of the _engine_type using a weakref of self.

The potential error location within the function is the use of weakref.ref(self) without importing the weakref module. This causes the weakref.ref method to be undefined and results in a NameError when attempting to create a weak reference to self.

The bug's cause is the missing import statement for the weakref module, which leads to the NameError.

To fix the bug, the weakref module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file and the weakref.ref(self) should be used to create a weak reference to self.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import weakref  # Import the weakref module

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ...
    """

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)  # Use weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By importing the weakref module and using weakref.ref(self), the bug is fixed, and the _engine function will work as intended.
