The `_engine` function is supposed to create and return an instance of the `_engine_type` class. However, the current implementation is using the `weakref.ref` function incorrectly, which is causing the issue.

The `weakref.ref` function is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used properly. The correct usage of `weakref.ref` would be to pass `self` to it as an argument, without calling it as a function. This will create a weak reference to the `self` object, which can then be used to create the required instance of `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version of the function will properly create a weak reference to the `self` object and use it to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class.
