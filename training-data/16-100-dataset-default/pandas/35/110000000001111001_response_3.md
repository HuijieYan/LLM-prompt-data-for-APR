The issue with the buggy function is that it is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not defined in the provided code. This is likely causing the function to fail when it is executed.

To fix this issue, we can remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and modify the function to simply return the `_engine_type` using the provided `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(len(self))
```

With this modification, the function will now return the `_engine_type` using the `self` parameter, which is consistent with the expected input/output variable information provided.
