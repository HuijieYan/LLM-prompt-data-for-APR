1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is used to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class which is then used for various operations on the `PeriodIndex` object. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is also related to the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically testing the `is_monotonic` property of the index levels, which internally uses the `_engine` method to check for monotonically increasing values.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` method is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` statement. Here, `self._engine_type` is used to create an instance of the engine, but there seems to be an issue with initializing it correctly, leading to the error in the failing test related to `NoneType` object.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to an incorrect initialization or assignment of the `_engine_type` within the `PeriodIndex` class. This leads to a `NoneType` object being returned when trying to access attributes or methods of the engine object, causing the AttributeError in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the initialization and assignment of the `_engine_type` within the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure it is correctly instantiated.
   - Ensuring that the `_engine_type` object is initialized with the appropriate arguments when creating an instance of the engine in the `_engine` method.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Assuming self._engine_type is correctly assigned and initialized
    engine_type_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_instance is not None:
        return engine_type_instance
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type instance is not initialized correctly")
```

By ensuring that the `_engine_type` is correctly assigned and initialized within the `PeriodIndex` class, the corrected `_engine` method should now pass the failing test.
