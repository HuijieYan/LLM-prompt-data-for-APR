The issue is likely occurring in the `_engine` function, where `self._engine_type` is being called, and it appears that `self._engine_type` is not returning the expected value, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid type and value. This can be achieved by modifying the implementation of the `_engine` function to properly handle the return value from `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
    else:
        raise TypeError("_engine_type returned None")
```

With this modification, the `_engine` function now checks if the result from `_engine_type` is `None`, and raises a TypeError if it is. This ensures that the return value from `_engine_type` is validated before being returned from the `_engine` function.
