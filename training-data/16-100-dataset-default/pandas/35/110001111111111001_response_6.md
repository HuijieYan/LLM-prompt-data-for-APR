The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the use of weakrefs and the _engine_type method. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the _engine method is returning None instead of the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the _engine_type method returns the correct value and also handle the weak reference properly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine method to use a strong reference instead of a weak reference, and to properly initialize the _engine_type method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# fixed version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))._maybe_mask_results(self)

```

With the above change, the _engine method now uses a strong reference and correctly initializes the _engine_type method. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test passes and the expected input/output variable information is satisfied.
