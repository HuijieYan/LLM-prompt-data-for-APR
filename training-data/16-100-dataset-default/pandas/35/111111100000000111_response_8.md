1. The buggy function is `_engine` which is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` while using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle. 

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the use of the `weakref.ref` method. This method creates a weak reference to the `self` object (in this case, the `PeriodIndex` object). However, there is a problem in how this weak reference is being utilized, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

3. The bug is caused due to the weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where it is described that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly throughout the code to avoid it being dropped prematurely.
   (b). Properly managing the lifetime of the weak reference to ensure that it remains valid when used by the `PeriodEngine`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is stored in the variable `period_ref`. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` to ensure that it remains valid and does not lead to the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
