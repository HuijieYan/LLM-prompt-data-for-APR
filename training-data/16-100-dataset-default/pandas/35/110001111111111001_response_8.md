The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct value. The `_engine` function is using `self._engine_type` to generate its result, but it seems that the `_engine_type` is not being initialized properly. This is causing an AttributeError when the program tries to access the view attribute on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to be modified to properly initialize and return the `_engine_type` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

With this modification, the `_engine` function will check if the `_engine_type` has been properly initialized. If it has, it will return the result of the `_engine_type` initialization, otherwise, it will return `None`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
