Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the weakref usage in the `_engine` function. It looks like the weak reference is not being properly set up, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

Bug's cause:
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before the intended time, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the error described in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly set up and maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.
2. Verify that the PeriodEngine is able to retrieve the PeriodIndex from the weak reference without issues.
3. Check for any other potential reference cycle or weak reference issues in the code related to the weakref usage.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly setup the weakref of self for the PeriodEngine
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be properly maintained and used by the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
