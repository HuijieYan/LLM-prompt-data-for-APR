The bug is likely in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `_engine` method returns a `NoneType` object instead of the expected value, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check the monotonicity of the levels. This fails due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it should.

The issue likely stems from the weak referencing mechanism not being implemented correctly in the `_engine` method, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` it expects.

To fix this, the `_engine` method needs to properly handle the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` and return the correct `PeriodEngine` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method that should resolve the issue:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly created and passed to the `_engine_type` method, resolving the weak referencing issue.

This correction should ensure that the failing test passes and that the expected input/output variable information is satisfied. Additionally, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
