1. The buggy function is a method that is decorated with the @cache_readonly decorator. It is supposed to return an engine type using self._engine_type. The GitHub issue is related to weak references being dropped prematurely, which results in the engine type receiving None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the weakref.ref(self) line, where we attempt to create a weak reference to self.

3. The bug's cause is related to the premature dropping of weak references, which results in the _engine_type receiving None instead of the expected PeriodIndex. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where it is mentioned that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to self is maintained until it is no longer needed.
   - Checking for weak references being dropped prematurely and addressing the issue in the code.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(self):
        if func.__name__ not in cache:
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            result = func(self)
            cache[func.__name__] = result
        else:
            result = cache[func.__name__]
        return result
    
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, maintain the weakref of self until no longer needed.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code addresses the premature dropping of weak references by introducing a cache to store the results of the function and maintaining the weak reference to self until it is no longer needed.
