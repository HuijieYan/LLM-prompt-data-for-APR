1. The problematic function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a `cache_readonly` function which returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` (PeriodIndex) and its length.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference to `self`. It seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being used correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. The GitHub issue indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely due to incorrect handling of weak references within the `_engine` function, causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the implementation of weak reference handling in the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed.
   - Ensure that weak references are used correctly to avoid premature deletion of the referenced object.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Correctly creating a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is created correctly and passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that it is maintained until it is no longer needed. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
