The issue is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This suggests that the weak reference created within the `_engine` function is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `None` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex and attempts to retrieve the level values for each level. The error occurs when checking if the retrieved level values are monotonic. The failing test along with the error message points to an issue with weak referencing within the PeriodIndex levels.

The GitHub issue details that weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex should be preserved until it is no longer needed. This involves ensuring that the weak reference does not get garbage collected prematurely.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test and the GitHub issue.

This fix will retain the weak reference to `self` until it is no longer needed, preventing the `None` object from being passed to the `PeriodEngine` and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
