The bug is caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to the `_engine_type` function getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is indicated by the GitHub issue title "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" and the detailed description provided.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly.

With this change, the code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
