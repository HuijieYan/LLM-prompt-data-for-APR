The buggy function is the _engine() method within the PeriodIndex class. This method is returning the result of calling the _engine_type constructor with 'period' and 'len(self)' as arguments. The failing test is testing the behavior of get_level_values when periods are used.

The error message AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' indicates that the return value of the _engine method is None instead of an expected value that should have the 'view' attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely in the _engine method, where the return statement returns None instead of the expected value. This might be due to an issue with the _engine_type constructor or its arguments.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the _engine method returns a valid value rather than None. This can be achieved by verifying the behavior of the _engine_type constructor and passing the correct arguments to it.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method within the PeriodIndex class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        # handle the case when the result is None, possibly by raising an error
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
```

With this modification, the _engine method will return the result of the _engine_type constructor, or raise a ValueError if the result is None. This should ensure that the failing test passes and the AttributeError is resolved.
