To fix the buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class, it seems that the issue is related to the `_engine_type` method. Let's modify the `_engine` function to include a proper instantiation of the `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self.dtype == "period":
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    else:
        return super()._engine
```

In this corrected version, we are instantiating the `PeriodEngine` specifically for dtype "period" and falling back to the default behavior for any other dtype. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
