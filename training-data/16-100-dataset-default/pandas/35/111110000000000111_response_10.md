1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is used to create and return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object as an argument.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` to create an instance of the engine.

3. The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it is intended to be. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None value instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior in MultiIndex operations as described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained for the entire duration it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`.
   - Investigating the lifecycle of the `PeriodIndex` object and the `PeriodEngine` to identify any discrepancies in reference handling.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference to the PeriodIndex object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have removed the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and instead directly assign the `self` object to the `period` variable. This ensures that a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is used when creating the `PeriodEngine`, addressing the issue of weak references being dropped prematurely.
