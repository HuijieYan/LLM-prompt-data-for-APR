The problematic function in the provided code is `_engine`. This function is intended to create an engine using weak references to the PeriodIndex instance. However, according to the GitHub issue description, it seems that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

The bug's cause appears to be related to weak references being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance is maintained for as long as it is needed by the PeriodEngine.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to modify the `_engine` function to explicitly maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the function's implementation to properly manage weak references.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
In this corrected code, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance is explicitly stored in the variable `period` and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until the engine is created, thereby resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
