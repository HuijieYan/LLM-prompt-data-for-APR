The buggy function is '_engine' within the class 'PeriodIndex'. This function is using weakrefs to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the weak reference to be stored as an attribute of the class instance, preventing it from being dropped before intended. Another approach could be to check the weak reference before using it within the '_engine' function and handle the case where it has already been dropped.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the class instance
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference exists before using it
    if self._period_ref() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref(), len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference has already been dropped
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced PeriodIndex has been dropped prematurely.")
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and handles the case where it has already been dropped before intended. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
