The buggy function is a method called '_engine' within the 'period' class in the file 'pandas/core/indexes/period.py'. This method is using a decorator '@cache_readonly' to cache the result of the function and return it on subsequent calls.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of 'weakref.ref(self)' to create a weak reference to the 'self' object. This is likely causing the bug as it is not being used correctly.

The bug's cause is that the weak reference 'period' is not being utilized properly and is not actually being passed to the '_engine_type' function as intended.

To fix the bug, we can create a strong reference to 'self' and pass it to the '_engine_type' function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
