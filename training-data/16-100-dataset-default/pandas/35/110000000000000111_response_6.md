1. The buggy function is intended to be a decorator that creates a read-only cached property. The function is being used to create a cached property for the `_engine` attribute of a class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `weakref.ref(self)` line, which is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the expected output to fail and raise an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained for the duration of its intended use, or reworking the caching mechanism to ensure that the cached property is properly stored.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_' + func.__name__):
            setattr(self, '_cached_' + func.__name__, func(self))
        return getattr(self, '_cached_' + func.__name__)

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that the caching mechanism properly stores the cached property and returns it when accessed, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
