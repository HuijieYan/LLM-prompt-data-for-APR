Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is using `self._engine_type` to create a new engine instance, but there is some issue with the `period` being passed to `_engine_type`.

Bug cause: 
The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the `period` is being passed as a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. It seems there might be an issue with how the weak reference is being handled within the `_engine_type` function, leading to the AttributeError when accessing 'view' on a 'NoneType' object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is being handled correctly within the `_engine_type` function.
2. Check if the `len(self)` is causing any issues related to the weak reference.
3. Verify that the class attributes and methods being used within the `_engine` function are properly implemented.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, the weak reference usage is removed, and `period` is directly passed to `_engine_type`. This should fix the issue related to weak referencing and resolve the AttributeError.
