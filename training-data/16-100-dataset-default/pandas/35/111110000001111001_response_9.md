The buggy function `_engine` appears to be creating a weak reference to `self` and then initializing the `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of `self`. However, the weak reference to `self` is unnecessary and may be causing issues.

The bug's cause may be:
(a). The unnecessary use of a weak reference in the `_engine` function.
(b). The possibility that the weak reference is impacting the initialization of `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary use of weak reference and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference, and this should resolve the issue.
