The potential error in the problematic function `_engine` is that the weak reference to `self` (`period`) is not being properly used to create a new `PeriodIndex` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` and checks if certain properties are monotonic. However, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before its intended use, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue also suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly use the weak reference to `self` to create a new `PeriodIndex` object that can be referenced by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly used to create a new `PeriodIndex` object inside the `_engine` function. By doing so, the weak reference is retained until it's used to create the `PeriodIndex` object, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
