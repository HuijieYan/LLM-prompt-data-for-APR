1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an issue with the `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected type of object.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function seems to be the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is likely where the issue lies, as it is creating the object that is causing the error.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the `_engine_type` object not being created correctly, causing it to return a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type, leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error message.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug might include ensuring that the `_engine_type` object is being instantiated correctly and is returning the expected type of object. It may involve checking the `PeriodArray` object, which the `_engine_type` function relies on, to see if there are any issues with its instantiation or implementation.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to self
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Instantiate the engine with the weak reference and length
    if engine is None:  # Check if the engine is None
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None")  # Raise an error if the engine is None
    return engine  # Return the engine object
```

With this corrected code, the `PeriodIndex._engine` function should now correctly instantiate the `_engine_type` object and return the expected engine object, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
