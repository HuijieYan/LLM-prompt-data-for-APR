1. The buggy function is a private method `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. This method returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` checks for monotonicity in the `PeriodIndex` and is failing with an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement that calls `self._engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments because it seems the `_engine_type` is not correctly returning an instance.

3. The bug is caused because the `_engine` method is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, but it is returning `None` instead. This results in an `AttributeError` when further operations are performed on the returned object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_engine_type` class returns the correct instance.
   - Check for any missing imports or incorrect implementations that may be causing the `_engine_type` to return `None`.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type must return a valid instance")
    return engine_instance
```
