Potential error: The function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator without it being defined anywhere in the provided code. This decorator seems to be intended to cache the result of the function, but it is not implemented properly.

Bug cause: The `@cache_readonly` decorator is not defined anywhere in the provided code, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `@cache_readonly` decorator before using it in the function.
2. Use a different caching mechanism, such as `functools.lru_cache`, to achieve the desired caching behavior.

Corrected code:
```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

# define a custom cache_readonly decorator or use functools.lru_cache
def cache_readonly(func):
    return lru_cache()(func)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have defined a custom `cache_readonly` decorator, which uses the `functools.lru_cache` to achieve the desired caching behavior. This should fix the bug and provide the intended caching functionality for the `_engine` function.
