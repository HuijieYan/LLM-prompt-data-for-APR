1. The buggy function is named "_engine" and it is being decorated with a decorator called `@cache_readonly`. The function returns the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The failing test "test_get_level_values_when_periods" creates a MultiIndex, generates a new MultiIndex from its levels, and then checks if all levels are monotonic.

2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the usage of weakref.ref. The weak reference is not being utilized properly, leading to an AttributeError in the failing test.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function "_engine" is intended to use weakref to avoid reference cycles, but the usage of weakref.ref(self) is incorrect.
   (b). The failing test "test_get_level_values_when_periods" creates a MultiIndex and attempts to check if all levels are monotonic. However, it raises an AttributeError due to weak reference issues.
   (c). The GitHub Issue details describe the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Review and revise the usage of weak references in the "_engine" function to ensure proper handling of weak references.
   (b). Update the failing test to handle the weak reference issue in a way that aligns with the intended behavior.

5. Corrected Function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference properly to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected function uses weakref.proxy(self) instead of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference, which should address the premature dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex.

With this correction, the failing test should pass successfully and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.
