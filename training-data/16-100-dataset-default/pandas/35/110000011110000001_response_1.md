1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type for a given object. It is related to the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The error message shows that the `AttributeError` is raised due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` as indicated by the error message.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `vgetter()` call is not returning the expected type, resulting in a `NoneType` object. This is likely causing the subsequent error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the return value of `vgetter()` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to access the `view` attribute. It may also involve identifying why `vgetter()` is returning `None` and addressing that issue.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None and engine_type.vgetter() is not None:
        return engine_type.vgetter().view("i8")
    return None
```

This corrected code first checks if the `engine_type` object is not `None`, and if its `vgetter()` method also returns a non-`None` value before attempting to access the `view` attribute.
