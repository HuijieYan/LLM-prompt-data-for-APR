1. The problematic function seems to be a method of a class, as it takes `self` as a parameter. The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which causes an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. This line is returning the result of `self._engine_type` but is passing the `period` as an argument instead of `self`.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` is returning a `NoneType` instead of the expected output.
   (b). The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of a `NoneType` object, resulting in an attribute error.
   (c). The GitHub issue explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct type of object, not a `None`.
   - Check the weak reference of `PeriodIndex` to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By using the decorator `cache_readonly`, we can ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct value and avoids prematurely dropping the weak reference. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
