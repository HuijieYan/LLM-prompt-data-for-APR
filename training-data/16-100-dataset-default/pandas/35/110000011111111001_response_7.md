The bug is caused by the use of the `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function. When the `weakref.ref` is used, it returns a weak reference object but not the actual reference to the object.

To fix this bug, we can change the `_engine` function to directly return the `_engine_type` object, instead of using `weakref.ref`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected function
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function will now return the actual `_engine_type` rather than a weak reference object, which will solve the 'NoneType' object attribute error.
