1. The buggy function is a method named "_engine" that is being used by the failing test function "test_get_level_values_when_periods". The error message states that the function is trying to access an attribute that does not exist, leading to an AttributeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is on the line "return self._engine_type(period, len(self))" where it may be returning None instead of the expected value.

3. The bug's cause is that the _engine_type method is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected type, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the implementation of _engine_type to ensure it returns the correct type of object, or modifying the _engine method to handle the possibility of None being returned.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            self._engine_cache = func(self)
        return self._engine_cache
    return wrapper

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_type_result is None:
        return None  # or handle the None case as per requirement
    else:
        return engine_type_result

```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the function should now pass the failing test without raising the AttributeError.
