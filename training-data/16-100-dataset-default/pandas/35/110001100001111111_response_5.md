The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is in line with the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" where the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped before it should be.

The function is supposed to return the engine type for a given PeriodIndex, however, it is not correctly handling the weak reference to the PeriodIndex. This is causing the engine type to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the issue described in the GitHub report.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the weak reference to the PeriodIndex. This can be done by ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until it's no longer needed. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the engine type receives the actual PeriodIndex instead of None.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and ensure that the engine type receives the actual PeriodIndex instead of None. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
