Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue lies within the `_engine` function. The failing test is related to the use of `PeriodIndex` within a `MultiIndex`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with weakrefs and a `NoneType` object.

The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is resulting in the AttributeError when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that the weakref of the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This could involve modifying the `_engine` function to handle the weakref in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# this is the corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will be maintained until it is no longer needed, resolving the issue of the `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
