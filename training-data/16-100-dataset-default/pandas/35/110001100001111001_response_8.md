The buggy function is using weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to 'self' and then passing it to self._engine_type. However, weakref.ref(self) returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This is causing the issue in the function.

The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object to self._engine_type instead of the actual 'self' object.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object and pass the actual 'self' object to self._engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly pass the 'self' object to self._engine_type. This fix will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
