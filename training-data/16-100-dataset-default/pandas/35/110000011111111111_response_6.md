The bug is located in the `_engine` function, which is expected to return the `_engine_type` with the input parameters `period` and the length of `self`. However, the error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine_type` is receiving a None instead of the expected `period`. This is likely due to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` not being used correctly.

The failing test is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` using the `_engine` function, but it results in an error due to a 'NoneType' object being passed to `_engine_type`.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. The expected output is that the `is_monotonic` assertion should return True.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` needs to be modified to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that a weak reference of `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`, resolving the bug and allowing the function to return the expected output.
