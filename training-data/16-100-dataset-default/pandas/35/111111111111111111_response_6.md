The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error is likely to be in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` is likely not being initialized correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` (`period`) is being dropped before the intended time, so the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class needs to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance via `self` when creating the weak reference. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` gets the intended `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.

The corrected function for the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self when creating weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_instance
```

With this correction, the function will properly maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that the intended `PeriodIndex` is used by the `PeriodEngine` and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
