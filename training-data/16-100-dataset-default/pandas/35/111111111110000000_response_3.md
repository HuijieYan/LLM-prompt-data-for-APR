# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type is not defined")
```
In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that `_engine_type` is not `None` before trying to create an instance of it. If it's `None`, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that `_engine_type` is not defined. This should help prevent the AttributeError that was occurring in the failing test.
