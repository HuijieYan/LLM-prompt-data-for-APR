1. The function `_engine` is a property method of the PeriodIndex class in pandas. It is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which indicates that the result of the method is cached after the first call.

2. The potential error location is within the return statement of the function. It is attempting to instantiate an `_engine_type` object with the arguments `period` and `len(self)`, but the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` might be incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and the arguments being passed to `_engine_type`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the `weakref` is being used correctly to avoid reference cycles.
   b. Check the correct usage of arguments for instantiating `_engine_type`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of self to `_engine_type`. This should prevent the reference cycle and correctly instantiate the `_engine_type` object.
