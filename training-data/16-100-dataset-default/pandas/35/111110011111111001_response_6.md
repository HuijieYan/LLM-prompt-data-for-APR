The issue appears to be with the `_engine` function, which is a cached readonly property in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine type.

The cause of the bug is likely that the weakref is not being properly handled within the `_engine` function, leading to the weak reference not being properly resolved.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly resolved and its target accessed to create the engine type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine
import weakref
import numpy as np

# ... (other code remains unchanged)

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    engine_type._reset_identity()
    return engine_type
```

This code creates an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the weak reference properly resolved and used to initialize the engine type. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
