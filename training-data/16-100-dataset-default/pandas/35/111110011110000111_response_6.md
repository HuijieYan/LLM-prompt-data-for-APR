The issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained so that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to correctly handle the weak reference.

Based on the analysis, a possible fix for the bug would be to modify the _engine function to make use of the weak reference properly and ensure that it is maintained throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ...
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    @property
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code maintains the weak reference to the PeriodIndex throughout the _engine function, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
