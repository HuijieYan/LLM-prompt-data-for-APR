1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `Period` class within the `pandas` library. It is used to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weakref of `self` to `_engine_type`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the `is_monotonic` property of `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` elements, and it is encountering an `AttributeError`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, specifically on the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` part.

3. The bug is caused due to the fact that the `_engine` method returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed in the failing test, it reaches the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` part, which is returning an AttributeError because the `_engine` is not properly defined.

4. In order to fix the bug, we can:
   a. Ensure that the `_engine` method is properly defined and returns a valid type that supports the required properties and methods.
   b. Check if the `self._engine_type` method is being called correctly and returning the expected type.
   c. Verify that the weak reference usage in the `_engine` method is handled properly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Assuming self._engine_type is properly defined and returns a valid type
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type_result
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without encountering the AttributeError.
