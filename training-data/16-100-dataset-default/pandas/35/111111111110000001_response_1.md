1. The buggy function in the PeriodIndex class is the `_engine` function, which is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator. This function returns an instance of `_engine_type` based on the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to verify if all `x.is_monotonic` for `x` in `idx2.levels`, where `idx2` is derived from `idx._get_level_values(level)`. During this process, the `assert` statement triggers the error message.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` function where the `_engine_type` is instantiated based on a weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.

3. (a) The `_engine` function tries to instantiate the `_engine_type` based on the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
   (b) The `PeriodIndex` class inherits from `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`. It provides a way to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
   (c) The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses a MultiIndex which includes a PeriodIndex for verification. It triggers the error message when trying to check `x.is_monotonic` for `x` in `idx2.levels`.
   (d) The failing test provides an error message stating that the `'NoneType'` object does not have the attribute `view`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_engine_type` is instantiated properly so that it does not result in a `NoneType` object.
   - Check if the weak reference `period` is being used correctly for the instantiation of `_engine_type`.
   - Verify the interaction between the `_engine` function, `PeriodIndex` class, and the failing test to ensure correct attributes and methods are being accessed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
In this corrected version, `PeriodEngine` is instantiated directly using `weakref.proxy(self)` to avoid the NoneType object error. This correction ensures that the weak reference `period` is used properly for the instantiation of `_engine_type`, addressing the potential issue identified.
