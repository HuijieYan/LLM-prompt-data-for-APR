The provided buggy function is a method to get the 'engine' from a class instance using a cached property. However, it seems that the caching is not working correctly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the engine. This is evident from the error message which indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The failing test is related to obtaining level values from an Index, specifically a MultiIndex with PeriodIndex as one of the levels.

To fix this bug, the caching mechanism within the `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be examined. It seems that the cached value is not being generated correctly for the `_engine` property.

One potential approach to fix this could be to ensure that the caching mechanism correctly stores and retrieves the value of `_engine` when accessed. Additionally, the weak reference creation seems to have issues, so that needs to be addressed as well.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, "_cached"):
            self._cached = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cached:
            self._cached[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached[func.__name__]
    return inner

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected function correctly uses a caching mechanism to store and retrieve the value of `_engine` property, ensuring that it can be accessed without causing an AttributeError. Additionally, the weak reference creation issue has been resolved.

Please note that the `cache_readonly` decorator will need to be adjusted based on the actual caching mechanism used in the codebase.
