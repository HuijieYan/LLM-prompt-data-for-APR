Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. It appears that the intention is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is incorrect. 

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference should be created to the object `self`, not just its value. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` should be changed to `weakref.ref(self)` to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the implementation of the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by using `period = weakref.ref(self)` to create the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
