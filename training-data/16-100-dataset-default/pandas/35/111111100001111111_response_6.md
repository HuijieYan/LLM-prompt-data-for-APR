The bug is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex (self) being dropped before it is intended to. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to errors.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

This fix keeps the weak reference to the PeriodIndex (self) until it is used to instantiate the engine_type, ensuring that the reference is not dropped prematurely.

After applying this fix, the input/output variable information provided and the GitHub issue will be resolved, and the function will work as expected.
