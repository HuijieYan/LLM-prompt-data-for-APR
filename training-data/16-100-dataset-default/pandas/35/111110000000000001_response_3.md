1. The buggy function is a cached readonly property called _engine which returns an instance of _engine_type. It is within the class PeriodIndex which is a subclass of DatetimeIndexOpsMixin and Int64Index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where it tries to create a weak reference to the 'self' object which might be causing some circular reference issues.

3. The potential cause of the bug is attempting to create a weak reference to the 'self' object within the PeriodIndex class which might be causing circular reference issues and leading to potential memory leaks.

4. To fix the bug, we can try using a different approach to handle the weak reference or avoid creating it altogether. Another approach could be to investigate if the _engine_type class has any specific requirements or if there are any issues with the implementation of the _engine method.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from weakref import ref

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    # Corrected and fixed function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(ref(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced `weakref.ref(self)` with `ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the 'self' object. This should help to avoid any potential circular reference issues and potential memory leaks.
