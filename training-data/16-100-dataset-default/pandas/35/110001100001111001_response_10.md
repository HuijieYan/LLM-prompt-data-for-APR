The issue with the given function is that `weakref.ref` is used incorrectly, and it should be used to create a weak reference object to the `self` object. Additionally, `self._engine_type` should be called with the weak reference object as an argument.

To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` to `weakref.ref` and then pass the weak reference object to `self._engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the function now correctly creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type`, along with the length of `self._values`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function operates as expected.
