1. The problematic function is the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is responsible for initializing the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to initialize a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and is failing with an AttributeError related to the `PeriodEngine`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` method is the line `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type, causing the AttributeError when trying to access methods on it.

3. (a). The buggy function: The `_engine` method is returning an engine of type `NoneType`.
   (b). The buggy class: `PeriodIndex` class where the `_engine` method is defined and used.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and is encountering an AttributeError due to a `NoneType` object.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Identify why the `_engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object and correct the code to initialize the engine properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```
By explicitly checking if the `_engine_type` returns `None`, we can handle the case where the engine initialization fails and raise a `ValueError` to indicate the issue. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
