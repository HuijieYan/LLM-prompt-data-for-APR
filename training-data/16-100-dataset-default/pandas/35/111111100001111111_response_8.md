Upon analyzing the provided information and the GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref usage in the `_engine` function. The weakref is not being used correctly, leading to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the weakref usage in the `_engine` function needs to be corrected to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly use weakref to avoid premature dropping of the PeriodIndex
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex will be retained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
