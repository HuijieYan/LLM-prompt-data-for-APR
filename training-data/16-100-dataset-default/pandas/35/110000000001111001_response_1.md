The buggy function is attempting to create a property `_engine` using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, but the implementation seems to be incorrect. The function is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with the period and the length of `self`, but it is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly as the period argument.

The discrepancy is that the function is expecting a `PeriodIndex` object as the period, but it is getting a weak reference object instead. This is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should directly use `self` as the period argument, instead of creating a weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import cached_property

@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self._values))
```
