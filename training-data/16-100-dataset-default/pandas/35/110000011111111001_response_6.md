The buggy function seems to be related to the implementation of the `PeriodEngine` class, particularly the `is_monotonic_increasing` method, which calls `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute is of type `None`, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test code tries to assess whether the `idx2` object has monotonic levels by checking the `is_monotonic` property for each level in `idx2.levels`, which ultimately calls the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `_engine` attribute.

The expected input parameter values include a `PeriodIndex` object, and the buggy function is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class.

It seems that the `_engine` method should be returning an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, but instead it is returning `None`, causing the subsequent error when trying to access attributes or methods of the nonexistent `_engine`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Fix the buggy function
@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # Return an instance of the PeriodEngine class
    return PeriodEngine(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By returning an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, the corrected function should satisfy the failing test case and provide the expected behavior for the input/output variable information provided.
