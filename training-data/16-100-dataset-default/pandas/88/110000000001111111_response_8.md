The issue arises from the fact that when the `columns` parameter is a multi-index, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

The problem is located in the section of the code where it checks if the `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and tries to access `table[values[0]]` when `values_multi` is False. This suggests that the code is expecting `table` to be a DataFrame but is actually getting a Series in this case, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `table` is a Series differently than when it is a DataFrame. We can transform the Series to a DataFrame in the single case.

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
    
    if not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This modified code checks if `table` is a DataFrame, and if not, converts it to a DataFrame using the `to_frame()` method. This ensures that the subsequent operations on `table` will be valid and prevent the AttributeError.

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case of multi-index columns and should operate symmetrically between rows/columns and single/multi cases, resolving the issue in the GitHub report.
