The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The error occurs when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of multi-index columns properly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-index columns and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    # ... (existing code)

    if not dropna and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.droplevel(level=0, axis=1)

    # ... (existing code)

    return table
```

This corrected version of the `pivot_table` function includes a condition to handle the case of multi-index columns when `dropna` is False. It drops the top level of the column index if the number of levels is greater than 1, addressing the AttributeError issue.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
