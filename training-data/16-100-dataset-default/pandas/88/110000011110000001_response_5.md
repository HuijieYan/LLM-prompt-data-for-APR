The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the pandas library. The failing test `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` from the `test_pivot.py` file is raising an error due to a problem with the `pivot_table` function.

The error message indicates an AttributeError at `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py:173`, specifically at the line `and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)`.

The cause of the bug is that the `pivot_table` function is trying to access `nlevels` attribute on a Series object, which does not have a `columns` attribute.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `pivot_table` function is not applied to a Series, as the MultiIndex won't be applicable for Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):  # Added check for DataFrame
        index = _convert_by(index)
        columns = _convert_by(columns)
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
        # ...
        return table
    else:
        raise ValueError("pivot_table only supports DataFrame")
```

This corrected version of the `pivot_table` function adds a check at the beginning to ensure that the function is only being applied to a DataFrame. If the input is not a DataFrame, it raises a ValueError. This will prevent the function from being applied to a Series, which was causing the AttributeError in the failing test.
