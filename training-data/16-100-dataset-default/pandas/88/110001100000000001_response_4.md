1. The buggy function `pivot_table` is utilizing a recursive call to itself when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to an infinite loop and eventually causing a stack overflow.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional check for `isinstance(aggfunc, list)`.

3. The bug is caused by the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list):` block. This recursive call creates an infinite loop, as the function keeps calling itself with the same parameters. The related function `_add_margins` is called when `margins` is True, and there is a possibility that the bug is affecting the behavior of this function as well.

4. To fix the bug, we can introduce a base case in the conditional check for `isinstance(aggfunc, list)` to handle the case when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead of calling `pivot_table` recursively, we can iterate over the list of `aggfunc` and create a list of DataFrames, then concatenate them and return the result. This will remove the infinite loop and avoid the stack overflow.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, when `aggfunc` is a list, a list of DataFrames is created by iterating over the `aggfunc` list and aggregating the grouped data. Then, the DataFrames are concatenated using `concat` and the result is returned, avoiding the infinite loop.
