The issue with the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns. In the cases provided, when the function is called with multi-index columns, the code encounters an error due to the assumption of the structure of the data.

The issue seems to be located in the section where it checks for the symmetry between rows and columns, and whether the data is single or multi-level. The error indicates that the function is treating the result as a Series instead of a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to handle the case of multi-index columns correctly and avoid treating the result as a Series in this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code...
    
    # existing code...

    table = agged
    
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.reset_index()
        table = table.set_index(keys=index, append=True)
        table = table.unstack(columns)
        table = table.fillna(fill_value)
    
    if not dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how='all')
    
    # existing code...
    
    return table
```

In this corrected version, the `table` is handled to ensure that it maintains its DataFrame structure, especially when dealing with multi-index columns. The `reset_index`, `set_index`, and `unstack` operations are used to reshape the DataFrame while maintaining its structure.

This corrected code should resolve the issue with the `pivot_table` function when dealing with multi-index columns, and it should also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided in the GitHub issue.
