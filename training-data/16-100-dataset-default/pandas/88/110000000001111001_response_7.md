The bug in the provided function is caused by the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function itself. This recursive call causes the function to be executed multiple times with the same parameters, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the recursive call to `pivot_table` should be removed. Instead, the function should use the `aggfunc` parameter directly to perform the aggregation, and handle multiple aggregation functions using the `groupby` and `agg` methods from the pandas library.

Additionally, the code should be refactored to simplify the logic and improve readability.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    keys = index + columns

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
        agged = grouped.agg({col: func for col in values for func in aggfunc})

    else:
        grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
        agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # rest of the code remains the same... (up to the return statement)

```

In this corrected code, the recursive call to `pivot_table` has been replaced with direct usage of `groupby` and `agg` methods to perform aggregation based on the `aggfunc` parameter. This approach simplifies the logic and eliminates the need for recursion.

This corrected code should now produce the expected output for the given input parameters, resolving the bug in the original function.
