The issue with the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to recursion, as the function is calling itself when `aggfunc` is a list. The recursion causes an incorrect table to be returned, resulting in an AttributeError when accessing the columns in the tests.

To fix this issue, the recursion needs to be removed and the logic for handling multiple aggregation functions needs to be revised.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> DataFrame:
    # Original function content goes here

    # New logic to handle multiple aggregation functions
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            agged = data.pivot_table(
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(agged)
        
        # Return a new DataFrame with the combined results
        return DataFrame({func.__name__: agged for func, agged in zip(aggfunc, pieces)})

    # Rest of the original function content goes here
```

With this fix, the `pivot_table` function no longer calls itself when `aggfunc` is a list, and the logic for handling multiple aggregation functions has been updated to correctly combine the results into a new DataFrame.

After making these changes, re-run the failing tests to ensure that the updated function works as expected.
