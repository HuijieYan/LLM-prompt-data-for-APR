The problematic function `pivot_table` is throwing an AttributeError when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The issue seems to be related to the attempt to access `table.columns` when `table` is a Series, which causes the AttributeError.

The cause of the bug is the conditional check `if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)`. When `table` is a Series, it does not have a `columns` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the conditional check should be modified to ensure that it only attempts to access `table.columns` if `table` is a DataFrame.

The corrected code for the problematic function `pivot_table` is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # existing code
```

With this modification, the conditional check ensures that `table.columns` is only accessed when `table` is a DataFrame, preventing the AttributeError.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the bug with `pivot_table` when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns.
