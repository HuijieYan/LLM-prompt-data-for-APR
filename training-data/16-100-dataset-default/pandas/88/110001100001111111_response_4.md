The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to handling multi-index columns. The function is designed to create a pivot table from the data in a DataFrame, but it fails when the `columns` parameter is a tuple representing multi-index columns.

The error occurs when the function attempts to access `table.columns.nlevels`, which fails when `values` is a single column rather than a multi-index.

The bug seems to be caused by the function's inability to handle multi-index columns properly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute on a single column.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle multi-index columns appropriately and ensure that the access to `table.columns.nlevels` is performed in a way that accounts for both single and multi-index columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:


```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # existing function code...

    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
            table = table[values[0]]

    # existing function code...
```

This corrected code ensures that the `table.columns.nlevels` access is conditioned on the existence of multi-level columns and that it handles single index columns appropriately. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

The correction considers the relationship between the `pivot_table` function and its related functions to address the bug related to the manipulation of multi-index columns in the provided test cases.
