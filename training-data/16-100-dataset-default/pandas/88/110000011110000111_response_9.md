The issue with the pivot_table function seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns. The error message indicates that the function is assuming the result is a DataFrame, but in the failing cases, it's returning a Series, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

To fix the bug, the pivot_table function needs to be modified to handle both DataFrame and Series outputs in the multi-index case.

Here's a possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Check if the output of the pivot_table function is a DataFrame or a Series.
2. If it's a Series, convert it to a DataFrame with the appropriate columns.
3. Ensure that the handling of multi-index columns is consistent for both DataFrame and Series outputs.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Index
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":

    result = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=columns, aggfunc=aggfunc, fill_value=fill_value, 
                              margins=margins, dropna=dropna, margins_name=margins_name, observed=observed)

    if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
        result = result.reset_index()  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    return result
```

With this corrected version, the pivot_table function should handle both single and multi-index columns without throwing an AttributeError. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test cases.
