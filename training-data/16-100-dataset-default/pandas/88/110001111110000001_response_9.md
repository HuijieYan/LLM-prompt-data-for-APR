The buggy function `pivot_table` in the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` is calling itself recursively in the case where `aggfunc` is a list of aggregating functions. This recursive call is problematic as it results in a Series being returned in some cases, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute.

The issue arises from the recursive call to `pivot_table` which is intended to handle multiple aggregating functions. This recursive call creates new `DataFrame` objects within a list and these are concatenated using `concat` resulting in a multi-column DataFrame. However, in certain scenarios, the function doesn't return a DataFrame and this results in an AttributeError when subsequent operations are performed on the returned object.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the recursive call and replace it with a different approach to support multiple aggregating functions. One possible approach to fix this would be to iterate through the list of aggregating functions and create multiple aggregated DataFrames. These DataFrames can then be concatenated to form the final result.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

With this change, the `pivot_table` function will now correctly handle multiple aggregating functions without causing a recursive call and returning unexpected types. This corrected version of the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test cases.
