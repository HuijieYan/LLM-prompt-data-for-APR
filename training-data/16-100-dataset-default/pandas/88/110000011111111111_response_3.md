### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function `pivot_table` encountering a `Series` object when checking for the number of levels in the columns. This is leading to an attribute error, as the `Series` object does not have a `columns` attribute.

### Potential Location of Bug
The potential location of the bug is within the section of the code where the function checks for the number of levels in the columns and makes an assumption about the type of object it is operating on.

### Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function appropriately handles different types of input for the `columns` parameter. Specifically, when the `columns` parameter is a multi-index, the function should handle this case correctly without encountering a `Series` object.

### Corrected Code
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code remains the same
  
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        keys = list(columns)
    else:
        keys = _convert_by(columns)

    # Existing code remains the same

    table = agged

    # Existing code remains the same

    return table
```

This fix involves updating the code to handle multi-index columns correctly by converting the columns to a list if it is a tuple before proceeding with the rest of the logic.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and ensure that the function works correctly for multi-index columns.
