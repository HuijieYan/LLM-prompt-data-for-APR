The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy with the `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The buggy function appears to be `_cython_agg_blocks` which is called by the `aggregate` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The buggy function seems to be encountering issues when trying to compute the mean of the grouped data with the `Int64` dtype. This is likely the cause of the TypeError and the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be modified to handle the aggregation of data with the `Int64` dtype properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks = []
        new_items = []

        for idx, block in data.iteritems():
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                block = block.astype('float64')
            agg_blocks.append(block.agg(how))
            new_items.append(idx)

        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        return agg_blocks, data.items.take(new_items)
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over the columns of the data and explicitly cast any columns with `Int64` dtype to `float64` before aggregating. This should resolve the TypeError and produce the expected output when calling the `mean` method.

This approach ensures that the function handles the `Int64` dtype appropriately when computing the mean, and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
