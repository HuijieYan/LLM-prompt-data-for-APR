The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is trying to cast float values to integer values using the `astype` method, which is causing a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types.

The function uses the `values` attribute of a `block` which might contain float values and then attempts to apply `astype` directly, which is not valid when converting float values to integers.

To fix this bug, we can refactor the code to handle non-equivalent data types in a more appropriate way, such as by using `pd.to_numeric` to handle the conversion. We can also add some additional checks to ensure that the data types are compatible before attempting to cast them.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # handle non-equivalent data types
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.dtype != np.dtype('int64'):
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # apply the operation with compatible data types
            result = alt(obj, axis=self.axis)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With these changes, the function should handle non-equivalent data types more gracefully and should pass the failing test cases.
