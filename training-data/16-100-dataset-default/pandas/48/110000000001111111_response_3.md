The issue with the function seems to be related to the aggregation of nullable integer data type columns. The `groupby` method on a DataFrame with nullable integer columns results in a `TypeError` when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This issue has also been reported in a GitHub thread.

The problem seems to be occurring due to the handling of nullable integer data types in the aggregation process. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to perform aggregation on the nullable integer data and encountering issues with certain aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data types appropriately during the aggregation process. The handling of nullable integer data types in the aggregation logic should be adjusted to ensure that aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` work correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values

        if hasattr(result, 'dtype') and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
            result = pd.to_numeric(result, errors='coerce')

        if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
            result = result.to_numpy()

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version of the function should handle nullable integer data types appropriately during the aggregation process and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
