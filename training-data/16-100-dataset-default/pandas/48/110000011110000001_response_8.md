a) The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the pandas library and is related to the groupby functionality.

b) The failing test is attempting to test the behavior of applying aggregation functions (such as mean, median, and var) to a DataFrame with nullable integer values.

c) The error message indicates that there is a problem with safely casting non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block where it tries to cast non-equivalent float values to int.

d) Bug cause:
When attempting to apply aggregation functions to nullable integer values, the function is failing to properly handle the casting of float64 values to int64.

e) Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

- Check for non-equivalent float values before casting to int and handle them separately.
- Use a more flexible casting method that handles non-equivalent values in a different way.

f) Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result

        # ... (other existing code)

        if result is not no_result:
            if result.dtype == 'float64' and block.dtype == 'Int64':
                # Handle non-equivalent float to integer casting separately
                result = result.astype('float64')
            else:
                # Handle regular casting
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # ... (other existing code)

    # ... (other existing code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
