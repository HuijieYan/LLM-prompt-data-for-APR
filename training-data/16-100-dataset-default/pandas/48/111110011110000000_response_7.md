The given function `_cython_agg_blocks` raises an error due to an incorrect casting from float to int. To fix this, we can use the `coerce_numeric` function provided in `pandas.core.dtypes.cast` to properly handle the casting. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import coerce_numeric

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # ... (the rest of the original function remains unchanged)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (original code remains unchanged)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # Use coerce_numeric to safely cast to original dtype
            result = coerce_numeric(result, dtype=block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
                #  and result is ndarray[object]
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    # reshape to be valid for non-Extension Block
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By using `coerce_numeric`, we can safely handle the casting of the results to the original data type of the Block, thereby avoiding the TypeError related to the incorrect casting.
