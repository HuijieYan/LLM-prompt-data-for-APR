The issue appears to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. The error does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but does occur with median and std. This indicates that there might be an issue with the implementation of numeric operations with the nullable Int64 dtype in the pandas library.

Based on the provided input parameters and the related GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` might be encountering a TypeError due to the implementation of the aggregation operation for the Int64 dtype.

The bug's cause might be related to how the function is handling the nullable Int64 dtype while performing the aggregation operation. It seems that the function is not properly handling the Nullable integer data type, leading to a TypeError during aggregation operations like mean, median, and std.

To fix this bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` will need to be modified to properly handle the aggregation operation for the nullable Int64 dtype. This might involve checking for the presence of null values and appropriately treating them during aggregation.

The corrected code for the problematic function might look something like this:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Ensure that operation handles nullable Int64 dtype
    if data._is_integer and data._is_nullable_integer():
        result = data._cython_operation_null(how, alt, min_count)
    else:
        result = data._cython_operation(how, min_count)

    agg_block: Block = data._wrap_result(result)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised code includes a specific check for the nullable Int64 dtype and handles the aggregation operation accordingly.

By making these modifications, the function should properly handle the operation for the nullable Int64 dtype and resolve the TypeError that occurs during aggregation operations, as described in the GitHub issue.
