The buggy function "_cython_agg_blocks" is causing a TypeError when trying to cast float64 values to int64. The issue seems to be with the safe casting of values to the dtype, which is not handling the conversion from float64 to int64 properly.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the safe_cast function to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 correctly.
2. Ensure that the values are safely cast to the correct dtype before further processing in the _cython_agg_blocks function.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
# this is the corrected _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.dtype.kind == 'f' and result.dtype.kind == 'i':
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)  # safely cast to the correct dtype

            # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

With this correction, the _cython_agg_blocks function should now handle the safe conversion of float64 values to int64 without raising a TypeError.

This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue. The function should now pass the failing test and resolve the problem of TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
