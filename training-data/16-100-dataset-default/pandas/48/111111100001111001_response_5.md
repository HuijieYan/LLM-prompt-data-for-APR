Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function may be related to the computation of the result in the wrong shape when aggregating numeric data. The code appears to handle the aggregation and creation of new blocks correctly, but there are discrepancies in the expected and actual shape of the result.

To fix this bug, you can modify the section of the code that handles the computation of the result to ensure that it is in the correct shape based on the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # Ensure the result is in the correct shape based on the input data
        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same... (list manipulation, error handling, etc.)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

This corrected code ensures that the result of the aggregation is reshaped to the correct dimensions based on the input data, addressing the potential bug in the original implementation.
