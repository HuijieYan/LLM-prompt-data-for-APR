The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to perform aggregation on data blocks, but it seems to be encountering issues with the data types during the aggregation process. The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting float values to int values, which is likely causing the TypeError.

It seems that the issue arises when trying to cast float64 values to int64, but the code is attempting to perform this operation using the "safe" casting rule, which is not suitable in this context.

To fix this bug, you can modify the type casting to explicitly convert float64 values to int64 directly without relying on the "safe" casting rule. This should resolve the type casting error and allow the function to perform the aggregation correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = False, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    # ... (existing code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if block.dtype == 'float64' and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer):
                result = result.astype('int64')

            # ... (existing code)

    # ... (existing code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this modified code, we explicitly check if the original block contains float64 values and the result should be cast to int64. If this condition is met, the result is cast directly to int64. This should resolve the type casting error and fix the bug.
