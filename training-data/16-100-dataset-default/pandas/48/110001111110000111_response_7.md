Based on the provided information, the bug is likely caused by the safe cast of values from float64 to int64, which is not supported. This is leading to a TypeError when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

To fix this bug, the safe_cast function needs to be updated to handle the conversion from float64 to int64. The safe_cast function should check if the values can be safely cast to the specified dtype and handle the conversion accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function with the fix for the safe cast:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.dtype == 'Int64' and issubclass(result.dtype.type, np.floating):
                # handle conversion from float to Int64
                result = result.astype('Int64', errors='ignore')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # ... (remaining code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this change, the safe cast from float64 to int64 is handled appropriately and the TypeError should not occur when calling mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and resolve the failing test cases.
