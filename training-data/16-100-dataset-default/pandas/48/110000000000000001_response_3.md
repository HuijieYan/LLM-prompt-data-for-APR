1. The buggy function is a method that seems to be part of a class, as it uses the `self` parameter. The function takes in several parameters and is expected to return a Tuple of two lists.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be related to the try-except block, where it catches the `NotImplementedError` and `TypeError`. There are also areas where it appends items to lists based on conditions that might not be handling all cases correctly.
3. The bug may be caused by improper handling of exceptions and conditional appending of items to lists, which might lead to unexpected behavior and results.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring proper exception handling and error messages.
   - Refactoring the conditional appending of items to lists to cover all cases.
   - Re-evaluating the function's purpose and considering simplifying or restructuring the logic for better maintainability.

```python

class DataFrame:
    pass

    pass

    pass

    pass

    pass

    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

                    except TypeError:
                        deleted_items.append(locs)
                        continue
                    else:
                        result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                        if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                            split_items.append(locs)
                            split_frames.append(result)
                            continue

                        assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
