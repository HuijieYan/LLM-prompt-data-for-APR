Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the section of the code where the aggregating function is being applied to the grouped data. Specifically, the error seems to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (Int64) when applying aggregation functions like mean, median, and std.

Bug cause:
The bug is likely caused by the interaction between the nullable integer data type and the aggregation functions in the DataFrameGroupBy class. The error occurs when applying certain aggregation functions to the grouped data, resulting in a TypeError due to the handling of the Int64 data type.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the _cython_agg_blocks function in the DataFrameGroupBy class to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) correctly when applying aggregation functions.
2. Check for the datatype before applying the mean, median, and std functions and handle the nullable integer data type appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        # Check for nullable integer data type and handle it appropriately
        if numeric_only:
            if isinstance(data.dtypes[0], pd.Int64Dtype):
                data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False).apply(pd.to_numeric)
            else:
                data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
```

This correction includes a check for the nullable integer data type and handles it appropriately to avoid the TypeError when applying aggregation functions. By checking the datatype and applying pd.to_numeric, we can ensure that the nullable integer data type is handled correctly during aggregation. This should address the error reported in the GitHub issue.
