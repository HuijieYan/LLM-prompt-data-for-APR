The issue appears to be with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is used for aggregating data. It seems to be encountering a TypeError when trying to perform the aggregation operations, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The function is supposed to aggregate data based on certain criteria, but it seems to be encountering issues with incompatible data types, which leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation. This can be achieved by checking for nullable integer data types and converting them to a suitable format for aggregation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.to_numpy() if block.is_extension_array else block.values,
                how,
                axis=1,
                min_count=min_count,
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function should now handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation, resolving the TypeError issue and satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
