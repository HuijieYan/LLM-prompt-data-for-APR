The probable cause of the bug seems to be related to the casting of data types when using nullable integer data type in the DataFrameGroupBy. The issue is likely to be related to the dtype='Int64' in the DataFrame creation, which is causing a TypeError when using the mean function on the grouped data.

One potential approach to fix the bug could be to ensure that the dtype='Int64' is handled properly within the DataFrameGroupBy class, specifically in the _cython_agg_blocks method. This may involve updating the method to handle the nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the case for nullable integers
                if isinstance(block.values, pd.UInt64Dtype):
                    block_dtype = np.float64
                else:
                    block_dtype = block.dtype

                result = block.values.astype(block_dtype)
                if how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
                    result = result.astype(float)

            assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

            if result is not no_result:
                # add the block with result to agg_blocks
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # Rest of the method remains the same
        # ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we handle the specific case of nullable integers by explicitly checking the dtype and casting it to the appropriate type when needed. This should address the TypeError issue when using mean, median, and var functions on the grouped data with nullable integer dtype.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and enable the mean, median, and var functions to work correctly with nullable integer data type in DataFrameGroupBy.
