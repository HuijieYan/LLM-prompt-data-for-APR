The given code looks incomplete and the test cases provided do not match with the implementation code. Therefore, without the complete code and corresponding test cases, it is difficult to determine the exact changes needed to fix the buggy function.

However, assuming the code might be dealing with safe casting between integer and float types, here's a modified version of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, MultiIndex, Block
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import BlockManager
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import get_grouper
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import maybe_downcast_numeric

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    
    # Rest of the code (unchanged)
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This is a modified version of the given code without the complete context and might not be suitable. Further modifications are needed to address the actual issue in the code.
