The provided code seems to be from a Python library (pandas) with the purpose of performing aggregation in groupby operations. There are multiple test functions provided along with the error messages. Based on the given information, it seems that the issue is related to the casting of certain data types in the `safe_cast` function.

Here's an updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with type hints and some added conversions:
```python

This updated function uses pandas specific methods (`select_dtypes`, `to_numeric`, etc.) to handle the data aggregation process and ensure compatibility with nullable integer data types. Additionally, it performs the necessary data type casting and manipulation.

It's important to note that the test cases will need to be executed again with this updated function to validate its correctness.
