The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is called by the test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` and it is failing with a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`. This error is being raised from the `safe_cast` function, specifically when trying to cast from float to int.

The issue seems to be happening when trying to cast the result to the original dtype and handling object-dtype blocks might be leading to unexpected results. The code is attempting to cast float values to int64, which is causing the error.

To fix the bug, the casting should be done based on the original dtype. The `safe_cast` function can be modified to handle this conversion correctly based on the original dtype of the values. Additionally, appropriate error handling and type checking should be added to avoid unexpected cast errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise  # handle this case appropriately
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        
        # Handle the result casting based on the original dtype
        result_dtype = data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array].dtype
        if result_dtype == 'int64':
            result = result.astype('int64', copy=False)
        elif result_dtype == 'float64':
            result = result.astype('float64', copy=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With the above changes, the corrected more robust function should be able to handle different dtypes and pass the failing test.
