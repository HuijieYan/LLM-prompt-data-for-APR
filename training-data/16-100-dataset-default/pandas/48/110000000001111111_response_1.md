The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with columns of type Int64. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the internal aggregation methods of Pandas, so there might be an issue with the aggregation algorithm for columns of type Int64.

From the provided information, it seems like the bug may be originating from the way the function is handling nullable integer data type (Int64) columns when performing aggregation operations.

The discrepancy in the expected and actual output relates to the TypeError that occurs when calling mean after grouping with Int64 dtype.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be modified to handle nullable integer data type (Int64) columns properly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's a possible approach to fix the bug:
- Check for nullable integer data type (Int64) columns within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and handle them appropriately during aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # Other variable initializations as in the original function

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle nullable integer data type (Int64) values appropriately during aggregation
        if block.values.dtype.name == 'Int64':
            result = block.values._values.astype(float)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        
        # Other code logic as in the original function

        if result is not no_result:
            # Handle nullable integer data type (Int64) values appropriately
            if block.values.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = result.astype('Int64')
            
            # Other code logic as in the original function

    # Other code logic as in the original function

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) columns appropriately within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue with calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with columns of type Int64 can be resolved.
