The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling exceptions when trying to aggregate the data. This causes issues with the aggregation process and results in incorrect or unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Adding proper exception handling to handle errors during the aggregation process.
- Implementing alternative methods for aggregation when the regular method is not applicable.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Loop through each block in the data
    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # exclude the block if the operation cannot be performed in an alternate way
                continue

            # perform aggregation using an alternate method
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(Block, result.values)
        except Exception as e:
            # handle any other exceptions that may occur during aggregation
            print(f"Error occurred during aggregation: {e}")
            continue
        
        # Append the aggregated result to the list of blocks
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Merge the aggregated blocks and items
    merged_blocks = _merge_blocks(agg_blocks, new_items, data.items)
    
    return merged_blocks
```
