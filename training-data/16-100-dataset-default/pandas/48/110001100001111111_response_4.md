The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. This is related to the handling of the nullable integer data type in the function. 

The issue seems to be occurring in the try-except block where the groupby aggregate function is called. The TypeError is likely occurring when trying to perform the aggregation operation on the `block.values` containing Int64 dtype.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in a different way when performing the aggregation operation. It may involve explicitly checking for and handling the nullable values within the `block.values`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if isinstance(block.values.dtype, pd.IntDtype):
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values.dropna(), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the exception
            continue
            
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This code includes an explicit check for the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) and handles it accordingly when performing the aggregation operation. This should address the issue and provide the expected output when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the nullable integer data type.
