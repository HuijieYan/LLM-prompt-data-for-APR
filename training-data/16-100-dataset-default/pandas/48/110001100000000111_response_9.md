The buggy function "_cython_agg_blocks" is called by the groupby method when the mean function is applied to a DataFrameGroupBy object. It is part of the pandas library and is responsible for performing aggregation operations on data blocks based on certain conditions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code where the actual aggregation is done, as the issue reported on GitHub is related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.

The bug is likely caused by the TypeError occurring when trying to call mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 data type. The function is not handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) properly during the aggregation process.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the _cython_agg_blocks function to appropriately handle the aggregation of data blocks with the Int64 data type. This may involve checking the types of data being aggregated and handling nullable integer data types differently. Additionally, appropriate exception handling should be added to handle cases where aggregation operations such as mean, median, and std are applied to the Int64 data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Handle nullable integer data type properly
    data = data.convert_dtypes()

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same
    # ...
    # (Remaining code stays the same)
    # ...

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:

        # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the
        # items we have removed
        # really should be done in internals :<

        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the data is converted to appropriate types using the `convert_dtypes` method to handle nullable integer data types properly during the aggregation process. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
