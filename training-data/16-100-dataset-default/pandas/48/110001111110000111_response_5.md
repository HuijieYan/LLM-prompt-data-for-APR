Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue is related to the dtype casting when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message specifically mentions the inability to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe', which indicates a problem with dtype conversion.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the data type casting process, specifically when casting the values to the dtype 'int64'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the data type casting is handled correctly and that the mean, median, and var functions can handle the nullable integer data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function should handle the data type casting correctly and resolve the issue with calling mean, median, and var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
