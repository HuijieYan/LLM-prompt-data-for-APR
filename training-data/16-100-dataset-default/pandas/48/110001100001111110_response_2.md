The issue is caused by the use of the `get_numeric_data()` method, which attempts to return only the numeric data, but it doesn't handle the `Int64` type correctly in this context.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the pandas source code (pandas/core/groupby/generic.py) as follows:

```python
# existing imports
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block, make_block
# other imports...

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    # change this condition
    if numeric_only:
        # to this
        if hasattr(data._data, "select_dtypes"):
            data = data.select_dtypes(include='number')

    # remaining code...
```

By making this change, the `select_dtypes` method is used to select the numeric columns correctly, including `Int64` type, which should resolve the issue with calling `mean`, `median`, `std`, etc. on the grouped DataFrame.

After making this change, you can run the failing test cases again to verify that the bug has been fixed.

Additionally, you can create a pull request on the official pandas GitHub repository with this fix, and reference the GitHub issue you created as the motivation for the fix.

The GitHub issue title will be:
```
Calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError
```

And the detailed description will include the steps to reproduce the issue, an expected output, and the version details, as well as a description of the fix and a reference to the pull request.
