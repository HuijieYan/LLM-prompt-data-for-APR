The buggy function is a part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used to aggregate data for the groupby operation. It seems to be encountering issues with safely casting non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

The potential error location within the function is likely the part where it tries to cast the values to a different dtype, as indicated by the error message "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')".

The cause of the bug seems to be the handling of data type conversion within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the data type conversion is handled appropriately based on the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values.astype(float)  # Convert values to float
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code handles the data type conversion by explicitly converting the values to float before aggregating them. This should address the type casting issue identified in the failing test.
