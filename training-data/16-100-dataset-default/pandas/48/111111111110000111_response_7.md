The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer values in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function tries to perform a safe cast of values from `float64` to `int64` using the `safe_cast` function, which results in a TypeError.

The bug is causing issues when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with nullable integer data type.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be updated to handle nullable integer values correctly and avoid attempting to cast from `float64` to `int64`. Instead, it should handle the nullable integer dtype appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Handling nullable integer values
        data = data.apply(lambda x: x.astype(float) if x.dtype.kind == 'i' else x)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... (rest of the function)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

```

With this corrected code, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle nullable integer values appropriately and avoid the TypeError when calling aggregation functions.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description and the failing test case.
