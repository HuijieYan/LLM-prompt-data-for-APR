1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be an aggregation function that manipulates block data in a DataFrame-like structure. It tries to aggregate data within blocks based on specific criteria, but the handling of exceptions and the edge cases related to object-dtype blocks and split blocks may be causing issues.

2. The potential error lies in the exception handling, especially when alternate aggregation methods are needed and when dealing with split object-dtype blocks.

3. The bug is caused by improper exception handling and handling of split object-dtype blocks, leading to incorrect aggregation results and potentially raising unexpected errors.

4. Potential approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
   a. Improving the exception handling to handle alternate aggregation methods more gracefully.
   b. Ensuring that split object-dtype blocks are handled correctly and that their results are aggregated properly.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                result = obj.agg(alt, axis=self.axis)
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not None and not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
