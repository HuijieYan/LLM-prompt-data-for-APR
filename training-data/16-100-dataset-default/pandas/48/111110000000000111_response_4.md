The buggy function is _cython_agg_blocks within the DataFrameGroupBy class. The issue is related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError as reported in the GitHub issue. This function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on blocks within a dataframe group.

The potential error location within the function could be related to the data type handling when performing aggregation operations, especially with the newer nullable integer data type.

The bug's cause relates to the inability of the function to handle aggregation operations on Int64 data type when performing mean, median, and std operations. The DataFrameGroupBy class seems to be using an older method of aggregation that does not handle the newer data types (Int64) correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the Int64 data type properly during aggregation operations. This could involve checking the data type before performing the aggregation and applying the appropriate method for the Int64 dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Handle Int64 dtype properly during aggregation
    if data._is_view and isinstance(data._data.blocks[0], IntBlock):
        data._data = data._data.convert(numeric_only=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The updated code includes a check for the Int64 data type and handles it properly during aggregation operations. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
