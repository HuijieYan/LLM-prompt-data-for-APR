The potential error in the given code is that there is a missing "self" keyword when calling the "get_numeric_data()" function. As a result, the function is not being correctly called within the class. 

To fix this bug, the "self" keyword should be added before calling the "get_numeric_data()" function so that it is correctly called within the class.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # FIX: Added "self" keyword before calling get_numeric_data()

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By adding the "self" keyword before calling the "get_numeric_data()" function, the bug is fixed, and the function will now correctly refer to the method within the class.
