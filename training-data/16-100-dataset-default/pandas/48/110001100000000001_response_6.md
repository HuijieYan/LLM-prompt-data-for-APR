The potential error in the problematic function is likely to be in the handling of the "split_items" and "split_frames" lists. It seems that the code is trying to handle the case where a block is split into multiple blocks and then process them separately, but the implementation is not correct, causing potential errors. This is evident from the extensive use of "continue" statements in the for-loop, which indicates that certain cases are not being handled correctly.

The bug's cause is related to the improper handling of split blocks in the function. The code attempts to process split blocks, but the logic for doing so is not comprehensive, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, a comprehensive approach would be to re-evaluate the handling of split blocks in the function. This could involve restructuring the logic for processing blocks so that split blocks are properly handled. Additionally, ensuring that the code has appropriate error handling and does not overly rely on "continue" statements to skip problematic cases would also be important.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
  
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
