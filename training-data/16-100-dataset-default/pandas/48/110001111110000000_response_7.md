The provided source code is very comprehensive and contains multiples test cases but it does not actually provide a description for the test case. Also, the source code provided does not directly address the issue at hand.

In order to fix the buggy function, it's important to inspect the `safe_cast` method. `safe_cast` is attempting to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, and since the values are not equivalent, it's raising a TypeError.

To address the issue, ensure that any float64 values are converted to equivalent int64 values before the casting. This can be achieved by rounding the float64 values before attempting to cast.

Here's a possible fix for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the error message:

```python
# this is the buggy function that has been fixed
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Iterate through the blocks, handle float64 type, all other types are processed as is
    for block in data.blocks:
        if np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.floating):
            # Round float64 values to the nearest integer
            result = np.round(block.values).astype(np.int64)
        else:
            result = block.values

        # Construct a new Block with the rounded or original values
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # Add to the list of agg_blocks and new_items
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This can handle the source of the TypeError caused by trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64. Always ensure the fix is compatible with the entire codebase by reviewing it in the total context.
