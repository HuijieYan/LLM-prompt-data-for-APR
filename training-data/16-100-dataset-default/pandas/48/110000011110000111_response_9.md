The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be related to a TypeError issue when using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message and the GitHub issue description provide insight into the problem.

The issue appears to be related to the `safe_cast` function in the buggy code, which attempts to cast values from float64 to int64 using the `astype` method. This causes a TypeError due to the non-equivalence of the float64 and int64 data types.

To resolve the bug, the safe_cast function should be modified to handle the casting of float64 to int64 in a safe manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-numeric data or unsupported operations
            if alt is None and how == "ohlc":
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(how)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The changes include handling the desired aggregation operations directly and simplifying the error handling logic. The goal is to avoid the unsafe casting of float64 to int64, thereby preventing the TypeError issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
