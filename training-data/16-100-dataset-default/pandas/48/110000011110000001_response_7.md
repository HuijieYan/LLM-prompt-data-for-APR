The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` which is failing with a TypeError related to casting float64 to int64. This error is occurring because the function is not handling the conversion of float values to integer values properly.

The failing test is calling the function with a set of values and a specific function (mean, median, or var), and expects the result to be a DataFrame. However, the function is not handling float64 values correctly, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to properly handle the conversion of float values to integer values. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to safely cast the values to the expected dtype, ensuring that the conversion follows the rule 'safe' to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex
import numpy as np
import pandas._testing as tm
import pytest

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...
    # existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.dtype == np.dtype('int64') and result.dtype == np.dtype('float64'):
                result = result.astype('int64', casting='safe')

            # existing code

    # existing code
```

By adding a check to ensure that if the original block's dtype is 'int64' and the result dtype is 'float64', then the result is cast to 'int64' with the casting rule 'safe', the type casting issue can be resolved.

With this correction, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function will handle the type conversion properly and should pass the failing test.
