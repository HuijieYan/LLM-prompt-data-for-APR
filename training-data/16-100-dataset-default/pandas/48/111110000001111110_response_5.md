The issue stems from a TypeError that arises when using the nullable integer data type (Int64) and calling the mean function after grouping in a DataFrame. Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    locs_list = data.index

    for col in data.columns:
        block = data[col]
        result = block.apply_grouped(how, axis=0, min_count=min_count, alt=alt)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    return agg_blocks, locs_list
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by iterating through each column and applying the grouped function to calculate the aggregation on IntegerArray dtype, which resolves the TypeError when calling the mean function after grouping.
