The given code has an issue with casting the float values to integer values, causing a TypeError. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the code to handle the conversions appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # The existing code

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # The existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if casted := maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype):
                result = casted
            else:
                no_result = result
                return ValueError("Internal Error")

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # Safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent
                type_casted = result.copy(dtype=block.dtype)
                if not (type_casted == result).all():
                    raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {block.dtype}")
                result = type_casted

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # The existing code
```

In the corrected code, we have added an additional check to safely cast the float values to integer values by using `copy()` and comparing the values to ensure equivalence before casting. This should resolve the TypeError when performing the aggregation.

Additionally, the original code had several ambiguous parts that needed further tweaking, so we've included a ValueError to capture these issues. We have also used Python's assignment expressions (walrus operator) for readability where needed.
