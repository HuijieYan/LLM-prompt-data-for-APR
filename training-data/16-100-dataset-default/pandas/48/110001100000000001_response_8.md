1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is meant to perform aggregation operations using the `grouper` on the given data. It iterates through the data blocks, performs the aggregation, and creates new blocks with the aggregated results. It also handles cases where the aggregation operation cannot be performed and has to resort to an alternate method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for handling alternative aggregation methods when the primary method fails. Additionally, there could be issues with the handling of split blocks and the subsequent cleanup.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be related to the handling of split blocks and the construction of new blocks with aggregated results. There may also be issues with accurately determining when the primary aggregation method has failed, leading to incorrect handling of alternative methods.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Review and improve the logic for handling split blocks and constructing new blocks with aggregated results.
   b. Enhance the error detection and handling mechanism to accurately identify when the primary aggregation method has failed and switch to an alternative method.
   c. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # check for alternative aggregation method
        if result is None and alt is not None:
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # sorting and indexing of aggregated items
    new_items_concatenated = np.concatenate(new_items)
    sorted_indexer = np.argsort(new_items_concatenated)
    new_agg_items = data.items.take(new_items_concatenated[np.sort(sorted_indexer)])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = new_items_concatenated[sorted_indexer][sum([len(agg.mgr_locs) for agg in agg_blocks[:i]]): sum([len(agg.mgr_locs) for agg in agg_blocks[:i+1]])]

    return agg_blocks, new_agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the handling of alternative aggregation methods has been improved, and the sorting and indexing of aggregated items has been optimized. Additionally, the code logic for creating new blocks with aggregated results has been revised to ensure correctness.
