The bug in the provided function is that the logic for handling the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` is incorrect. The function is returning a list of `agg_blocks` and a list of `agg_items`, but the logic for constructing these lists is not properly handling certain cases, leading to a `DataError` being raised when there are split blocks.

To fix this, the function should be modified to properly handle the cases where blocks are split. Additionally, the code for indexing and resetting `mgr_locs` should be adjusted to correctly handle the cases when certain blocks are excluded.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indices: List[int] = []
    
    for label, group in data.iteritems():
        result = group.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(Block(result))
        indices.append(label)
    
    return agg_blocks, Index(indices)
```

With this corrected logic, the function will properly aggregate the data without splitting blocks improperly, and it will handle the group labels and aggregation result indices correctly.

This fix addresses the underlying issue with the function and should prevent the `DataError` from being raised when aggregating the data.
