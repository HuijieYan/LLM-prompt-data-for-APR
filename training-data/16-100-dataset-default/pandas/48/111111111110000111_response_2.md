Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of float values to int64 dtype. This is likely causing the TypeError when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The bug's cause is related to the handling of nullable integer data type Int64 in the _cython_agg_blocks function, which results in a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integer data type needs to be modified in the _cython_agg_blocks function to ensure that the data is properly cast to the appropriate dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Fix the handling of nullable integer data type in _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False).astype(float)  # Convert to float

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Remaining code for the function as is
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By converting the data to float dtype, we ensure that the nullable integer data is handled appropriately without causing a TypeError when calling mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
