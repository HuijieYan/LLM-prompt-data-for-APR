Analyzing the provided code, it seems that the error is related to an attempt to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, which is not possible due to non-equivalent types. This is likely happening in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method where the function is trying to safely cast the values to the dtype, but encounters a TypeError when attempting to do so.

The potential error location is within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method where it tries to cast the values of the array to a different dtype.

The bug's cause is related to the data types being used and the attempt to cast them to a different type.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the data types are properly handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. This may involve checking the data types before attempting to perform any casting and handling float64 and int64 types differently.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # other parts of the code
        # ...

        if result.ndim > 1:
            # handling float64 types
            if result.dtype == 'float64':
                result = result.astype('int64')
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # the rest of the code
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we check the dtype of the result and if it is 'float64', we cast it to 'int64' to avoid the TypeError encountered in the original code. This approach handles the data types appropriately and should pass the failing test.
