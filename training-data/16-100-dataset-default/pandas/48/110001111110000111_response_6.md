The bug is caused by the _cython_agg_blocks function, which is called by the groupby function in pandas. The error occurs when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

The issue stems from an attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, which triggers a TypeError. This occurs because the _cython_agg_blocks function attempts to cast the values to a specific dtype, causing the exception.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _cython_agg_blocks function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately, avoiding the TypeError when casting non-equivalent types.

Here's the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for aggregating the data blocks and avoids the TypeError by removing the unnecessary casting and handling nullable integer data types appropriately.

By using this corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function, the issue with calling mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype should be resolved. The corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
