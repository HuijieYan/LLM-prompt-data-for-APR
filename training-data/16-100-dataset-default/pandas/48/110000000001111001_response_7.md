The bug in the given function seems to be related to the handling of the result variable. The function is not properly collecting the results and appending them to the agg_blocks list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the result is properly collected and appended to the agg_blocks list for each block in the data. Additionally, we need to handle the case where split_blocks are created and ensure they are processed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    split_items: List[int] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            if len(result) > 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
            else:
                result = result.to_numpy()

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # handle split_blocks
    for locs in split_items:
        block = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(agg_blocks[i].values) for i in locs], axis=1)
        agg_blocks.append(block)

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(block.mgr_locs)
        block = block.set_axis(data.items.take(indexer[i : (i + loc)]), axis=0)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with collecting and appending results to the agg_blocks list, as well as handling split_blocks when they occur. Additionally, the code ensures that the returned agg_blocks and agg_items satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
