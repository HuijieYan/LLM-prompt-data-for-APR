1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for reshaping data. It is supposed to pivot the data in the DataFrame. The function takes four parameters: data, index, columns, and values, and returns a pivoted DataFrame. However, there are several potential issues in the implementation of the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional blocks that handle the cases where "values" is None and where it is not None. There is a complexity in the conditional statement and the nested if-else blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of the cases where values is None or not None within the conditional blocks. Additionally, the use of multiple if-else statements makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

4. To fix the bug, it is suggested to simplify the conditional structure and handle the cases where "values" is None and not None separately. Additionally, the logic for creating the "indexed" DataFrame needs to be revised to ensure that it correctly handles the cases based on the input parameters.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot(data: DataFrame, index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> DataFrame:
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)):
            indexed = data[values]
        else:
            indexed = data[values]
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional structure has been simplified, and the handling of the "values" parameter has been revised. The logic for creating the "indexed" DataFrame has also been improved to ensure correct behavior based on the input parameters.
