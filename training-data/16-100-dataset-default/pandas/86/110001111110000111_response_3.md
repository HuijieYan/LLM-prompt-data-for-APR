The buggy function is `pivot` in the file pivot.py, which is used for reshaping a DataFrame. The failing test `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` tries to pivot a DataFrame with `columns=None` and expects a specific TypeError to be raised. However, when the test is run, a KeyError is raised instead, leading to confusion.

The cause of the bug is within the `pivot` function, specifically in the conditional statement where it handles the case when `values` is None. When `columns` is None and `values` is None, it should raise a TypeError indicating that 'columns' is a required argument. However, the code currently doesn't handle this case correctly, leading to the KeyError being raised instead.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement handling the case when `values` is None needs to be modified. It should explicitly check if `columns` is None and raise a TypeError in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot` function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if columns is None:
            raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected code, the test `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` should pass as it will now correctly raise the TypeError when `columns` is None. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub will also be resolved as the error message will now accurately indicate that 'columns' is a required argument when it is missing.
