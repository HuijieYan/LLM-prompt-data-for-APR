1. The buggy function is a custom implementation of the pivot function for DataFrames in the pandas library. The function takes a DataFrame, along with index, columns, and values as parameters, and then calls set_index and unstack methods to reformat the data. The relationship with the GitHub issue is that the function is not handling the case where columns is None correctly, and the error message raised is confusing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the values parameter. When values is None, the function attempts to set the index based on the columns parameter, but it does not handle the case where columns is also None. This leads to the confusing error message mentioned in the GitHub issue.

3. (a) The buggy function is not handling the case where columns is None correctly.
   (b) The GitHub issue provides an example where columns is passed as None, and the error message KeyError: 'None of [None] are in the columns' is raised. This indicates that the function is not properly handling the None value for columns.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to explicitly check for the case where columns is None and raise an appropriate error message. Another approach could be to modify the function signature to make columns a required parameter, in line with the pandas documentation.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise ValueError("columns parameter is required for pivot operation")

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to verify that the columns parameter is not None, and if it is, a ValueError is raised. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
