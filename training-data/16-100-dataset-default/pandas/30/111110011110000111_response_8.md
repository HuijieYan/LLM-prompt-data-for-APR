The buggy function is a method `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. The function takes in data and tries to convert it to a date format, but it is failing when the input data contains boolean values. This function is being called by the `read_json` method in the pandas library, which is then invoked by the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`.

The error message indicates a TypeError when trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime object. The failing test is also an example of this issue, where a JSON array of boolean values is expected to be read as a series of boolean values but instead raises an exception.

The GitHub issue provides the description of the problem, expected output, and the versions of the pandas library and its dependencies. It also includes the traceback and details of the problem encountered.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle the case where the input data contains boolean values. This can be achieved by adding a check to handle boolean data separately and returning it as is, without attempting any date conversions.

The corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser:

    # Fixed function to handle boolean values
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # Return boolean data as is

        new_data = data

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this fix, the function will handle boolean values correctly and return them as is without attempting any unnecessary date conversions. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
