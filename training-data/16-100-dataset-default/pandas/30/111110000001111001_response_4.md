The buggy function is trying to convert the input data to a date column, but it is not handling the different data types correctly. It is also using variables that are not defined in the function, such as `isna`, `iNaT`, and `to_datetime`. It also seems to be missing the import statement for `np` which is presumably for the `numpy` library.

The potential error is that the function is not properly handling the conversion of different data types to a date format, and it is using variables that are not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different data types properly and make sure that the function can handle the data conversion to a date format for both numerical and object data types. We also need to make sure that all the necessary methods and variables are properly imported.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, np.ndarray):  # Check if data is a numpy array
            new_data = data
            if new_data.dtype == "object":
                try:
                    new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
                except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                    pass

            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True
        else:  # If data is not a numpy array, handle it accordingly or raise an error
            # Handle conversion for other data types
            return data, False
```

This corrected code should now handle the conversion of different data types to a date format for a numpy array. It also handles the different data types and takes into account the min_stamp and date_unit variables.
