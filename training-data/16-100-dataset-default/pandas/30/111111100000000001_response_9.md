Analysis:
1. The function "_try_convert_to_date" is a method of the "Parser" class, which seems to be a part of a JSON parser functionality in the pandas library.
2. The potential error location within the function is the conversion of the "new_data" to datetime using the "to_datetime" function. There are multiple try-except blocks, and the return statements within the for loop may not be functioning correctly.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the conversion to datetime and the handling of different data types within the function. The try-except blocks and the return statements within the for loop may not be executing as intended.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the conversion to datetime is handled correctly for different data types, and that the return statements within the for loop are structured appropriately. Additionally, we need to handle the conditions for returning the boolean value for successful parsing.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas import NaT as iNaT, isna, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def __init__(self, date_unit, min_stamp):
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ("ns", "us", "ms", "s")

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return new_data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
- Added the necessary import statements for numpy and pandas functions.
- Changed the comparison from `new_data.dtype == "object"` to `is_numeric_dtype(new_data)`.
- Used `new_data` instead of `data.astype("int64")` to assign the result of the conversion.
- Updated the condition for returning the boolean value for successful parsing within the for loop.
- Replaced `new_data._values` with `new_data` for comparisons.
- Made minor improvements in the variable naming for clarity and consistency.
