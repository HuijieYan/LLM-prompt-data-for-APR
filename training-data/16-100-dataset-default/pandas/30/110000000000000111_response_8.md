1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is likely related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for parsing and converting data into a date column, which is the source of the problem in the GitHub issue. The function attempts to convert boolean values into datetime values, which is incorrect and leads to the issue described in the GitHub problem.

2. The potential error location within the function is when it attempts to convert boolean values into datetime values. This is likely causing the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug's cause, as indicated by the function and the GitHub issue, is the incorrect conversion of boolean values into datetime values by the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type of the input and handling boolean values separately to prevent their conversion into datetime values.
   - Adding conditional checks to ensure that boolean values are not processed as datetime values within the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_bool_dtype(data):  # Handling boolean values separately
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a conditional check to handle boolean values separately and prevent them from being processed as datetime values. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
