1. The buggy function is supposed to convert a given data array into a date column by parsing it in different formats and coercing object in epoch/iso formats, as well as integer/float in epoch formats. However, there are issues with the data conversion and error handling logic.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of different data types and the conversion to date format using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug is caused by improper handling of different data types and improper error handling logic. The function does not handle all possible exceptions that can occur during the conversion process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the data type before attempting to convert it to another data type
   - Handle all possible exceptions that can occur during the conversion process
   - Use proper error handling techniques to gracefully handle the exceptions
   
5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if len(data) == 0:  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):  # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
