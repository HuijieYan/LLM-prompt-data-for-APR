The issue seems to be related to the function `_try_convert_to_date`, which is trying to parse data into a date column and convert it to a specific format. However, it is currently returning unexpected results, including converting boolean values into timestamps, and raising a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the logic that checks for the data type and attempts to convert it to "int64" dtype, as well as the logic that checks for numbers out of range and attempts to convert them to datetime.

It seems that the function is incorrectly handling boolean values and might be incorrectly converting them to timestamps. This is likely the cause of the issue described in the GitHub post.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to handle boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them to timestamps. Additionally, you should ensure that the function properly handles different data types and only attempts to convert them to datetime when necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
        
    # handle boolean data separately
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            np.isnan(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle boolean values, avoid converting them to timestamps, and handle other data types in a way that successfully resolves the issue described in the GitHub post.
