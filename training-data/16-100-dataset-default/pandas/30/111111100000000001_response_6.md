1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class, which is used for parsing data. The function is meant to convert data into a date column by trying to parse it into date formats. It checks for different data types and attempts to convert them into date formats.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conversion of data to integer in the "if new_data.dtype == 'object'" block. There might be issues with this conversion, resulting in the function not working as intended.

3. The buggy function has several potential causes for the bug:
   (a). The function is trying to convert data into date formats, but the conversion process may not be handling all data types correctly.
   (b). The Parser class may not be initializing some necessary variables, leading to unexpected behavior in the function.
   (c). The related functions, such as "to_datetime" and "isna", may not be handling exceptions properly or providing incorrect results, leading to the function not working as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the necessary variables in the Parser class are properly initialized.
   - Check the conversion process for different data types in the function and handle them appropriately.
   - Validate the functionality of related functions such as "to_datetime" and "isna" to ensure they are functioning as expected.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser:
    def __init__(self, date_unit, min_stamp):
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ["s", "ms"]

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) 
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Proper initialization of necessary variables in the Parser class is ensured.
- The data conversion process in the "_try_convert_to_date" function has been modified to handle different data types appropriately.
- The functionality of related functions such as "to_datetime" and "isna" is assumed to be correct.
