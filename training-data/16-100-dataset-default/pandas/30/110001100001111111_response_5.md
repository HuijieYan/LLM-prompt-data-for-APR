Based on the GitHub issue and the provided input/output variable information, it seems that the bug is related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the pandas `read_json` module. The function is supposed to convert input data to a date column, but it is currently producing incorrect results, returning date objects when the input data is of type bool or an integer range.

The potential error location within the function is most likely in the block of code that attempts to infer the new data type based on the input dtype.

The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly infers the data type and attempts to convert data that is already in the correct format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to first check the data type of the input and return it as is if it is already in the correct format. Another approach could be to add specific handling for bool and integer range inputs to avoid unnecessary conversions.

Here's a corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if data.dtype == "int64" or data.dtype == "float64":
        return data, False  # No need to parse, already in epoch format
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # No need to parse, already in boolean format

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
    except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
        return data, False
    return new_data, True
```

This corrected function should now properly handle input data of type RangeIndex and Series of bools, and should return the expected output.
