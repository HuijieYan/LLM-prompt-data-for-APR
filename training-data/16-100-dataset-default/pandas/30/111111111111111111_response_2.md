The issue is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function which is incorrectly converting boolean values to timestamps. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, as users would expect a Series of bools, and is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used.

To fix this issue, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should not attempt to convert boolean values to timestamps. Instead, it should return the original data as it is.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object" and is_datetime64_dtype(data):
        return data, True
   
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
