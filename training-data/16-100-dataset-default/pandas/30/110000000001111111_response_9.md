The issue in the code is that the function is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to date values, instead of returning the original boolean values. This is causing the problem described in the GitHub issue where a Pandas Series of timestamps is being returned, instead of a Series of boolean values.

The bug is caused by the code attempting to convert boolean values to date values. This is evident from the expected value and type of variables, which should result in a RangeIndex of boolean values, but instead is returning a RangeIndex of int64 values.

To fix the bug, the function should check the type of the input data and return the original data if it is a DataFrame with boolean values.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if data.empty:
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly return the original boolean values if the input is a Series with boolean data type, and it will return the original data if it is not a boolean data type.
This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report.
