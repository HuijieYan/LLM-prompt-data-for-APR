1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. It is responsible for attempting to convert data into a date column.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the `if` statement checking for an empty array (`if not len(data)`), as well as in the section where it tries to coerce object types into `int64`.

3. (a) The buggy function attempts to convert data into a date column by checking for empty data, coercing object types into `int64`, and then converting to date using the `to_datetime` function.
   (b) The `Parser` class seems to be related to parsing data, but the specific relationship with the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.
   (c) Related functions include `to_datetime` for converting data to datetime, as well as some numpy functions for data type checking.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking for the length of `data` using `if len(data) > 0` instead of `if not len(data)`
   - Addressing the coercion of object types into `int64` to ensure it is done correctly
   - Ensuring that the `to_datetime` function is used with the correct parameters and error handling

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():
    # Fixed version of the function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # conversion on non-empty
        if len(data) > 0:
            new_data = data
            if new_data.dtype == "object":
                try:
                    new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
                except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                    pass

            # ignore numbers that are out of range
            if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    isna(new_data._values)
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                    | (new_data._values == iNaT)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False

            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                    return new_data, True
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue

        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the `if not len(data)` has been changed to `if len(data) > 0` to handle non-empty data. The `new_data` is now correctly assigned to `data` in the coercion section. The `to_datetime` function is now properly used with error handling and returning the new_data and True inside the loop.
