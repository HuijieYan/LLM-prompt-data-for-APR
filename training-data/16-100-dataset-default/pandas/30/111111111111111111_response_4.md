The issue is likely occurring within the `_try_convert_to_date` function, as it is trying to convert boolean values to datetime values, which is causing the TypeError. This function is part of the Parser class in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values properly, and ensure that it returns the expected output for the failing test case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

This corrected function explicitly checks for boolean values and returns them if encountered, rather than trying to convert them to datetime values.

With this change, the failing test case should now pass, and the function should return the expected output for the provided input parameters. This fix also resolves the issue reported on GitHub by providing a Series of bools instead of raising a TypeError.

This proposed solution satisfies all the requirements and addresses the bug identified in the provided information.
