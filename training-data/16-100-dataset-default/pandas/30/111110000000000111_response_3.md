1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It seems to be related to parsing and converting data into date format, but it has several issues as pointed out in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion process, where it tries to convert the data to a datetime format. This conversion process seems to be causing the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert input data into a datetime format, but it is not handling boolean values correctly, which is causing the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
   (b). The `Parser` class seems to be responsible for parsing and converting data, and the `_try_convert_to_date` method is a part of this functionality.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides details about how `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` is encountering issues when the input JSON contains boolean values. It mentions that the expected output is a Series of bools, but instead results in a Series of timestamps or raises an exception.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Handle boolean values separately within the `_try_convert_to_date` function to ensure that they are not converted to datetime format.
   (b). Update the conversion logic to correctly handle different data types, including boolean values, and ensure that the output matches the expected data type.
   (c). Test the function with various input types to verify that the conversion process behaves as expected.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        
        return data, False
```

This corrected code includes handling for boolean values and uses the `is_bool_dtype` function from the `pandas.api.types` module to identify boolean data. It ensures that boolean values are not converted to datetime format and returns the input data as it is. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
