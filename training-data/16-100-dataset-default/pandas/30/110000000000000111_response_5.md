1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue in that it involves parsing a JSON list of bools and converting it into a Pandas Series object. However, due to a TypeError, the output is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the function is the try block where it tries to coerce the data into int64. This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with bool values.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is attempting to coerce the bool values into int64, which is resulting in incorrect output. The GitHub issue further confirms that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but it is currently inconsistent and raises a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to handle bool values separately before attempting to coerce to int64
   - Modifying the function to handle bool values appropriately and only convert non-bool values to datetime

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
