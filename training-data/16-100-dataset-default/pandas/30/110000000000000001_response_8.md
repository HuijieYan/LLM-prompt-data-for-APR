1. The buggy function is designed to try to parse an ndarray into a date column. It checks for various conditions and data types, and attempts to convert the data into date format. However, there are some potential issues in the code that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the date conversion and the condition for checking if the data is out of range.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the date conversion and the out of range check, leading to potential errors in parsing the data into date format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include handling the date conversion more effectively, ensuring that the out of range check is accurate, and making sure that the function returns the correct output based on the data parsing.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """

    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Changed data.astype to new_data.astype
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)  # Changed new_data._values to new_data
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False  # Changed data to new_data

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False  # Changed data to new_data
```

In the corrected code:
- Changed `data.astype` to `new_data.astype` to ensure the correct variable is being used.
- Changed `new_data._values` to `new_data` as `_values` is not needed for this operation.
- Changed `data` to `new_data` in the out of range check to ensure the correct variable is being checked.
- Return `new_data` instead of `data` in the return statements to ensure the correct variable is being returned.
