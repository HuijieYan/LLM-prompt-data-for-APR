The issue seems to be related to the function `_try_convert_to_date` in the `Parser` class, which is used to parse data into a date column. The function is meant to handle different data types and formats, but it is currently failing and returning incorrect results.

Upon analyzing the function and the provided input/output information, it seems like the error might be occurring in the section that attempts to convert object data types to int64. It also seems that there is a problem with handling boolean data types.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, explaining that using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a json list of bools results in timestamps/exceptions instead of a Series of bools.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function `_try_convert_to_date` to correctly handle boolean data types and ensure that it returns the expected output based on the provided input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True
        
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this corrected function, it should now properly handle boolean data types and return the expected output based on the provided input parameters. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
