1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is used in the context of parsing ndarrays into a date column in Pandas. The GitHub issue is related to using the "read_json" function with typ="series" resulting in unexpected behavior, specifically converting bool values into timestamps or throwing exceptions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of bool values to timestamps, which is not the expected behavior.

3. The bug is caused by the function incorrectly attempting to convert bool values to timestamps when parsing ndarrays into a date column. This behavior is related to the GitHub issue because the issue also involves unexpected conversion of bool values when using the "read_json" function with typ="series".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Adding a condition to check for bool values and handle them appropriately without attempting to convert them to timestamps.
   (b). Ensuring that the function only attempts to parse values that are in a format suitable for conversion to timestamps.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime
from pandas.core.nanops import _maybe_match_name

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_datetime(data):
        return data, True

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the input data is already in a datetime format and returns it immediately. If not, it attempts to convert the data to datetime using "pd.to_datetime" and handles any exceptions that may occur during the conversion. This approach should fix the issue and ensure that bool values are not incorrectly converted to timestamps.
