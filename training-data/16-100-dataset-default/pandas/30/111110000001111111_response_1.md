The issue appears to be related to the `_try_convert_to_date` method of the `Parser` class, which is supposed to convert input data into a date format. However, the method seems to be incorrectly processing the input data and returning incorrect output, which is causing the date parsing to fail, as described in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the data type is "object" and then attempts to convert it to "int64". This conversion may not be suitable for all types of input data, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the check for numbers that are out of range also seems to be incorrect and returning incorrect values for the `in_range` variable.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of different data types and the logic for checking if the data is in range. This is leading to incorrect results and causing the date parsing to fail.

To fix the bug, it is important to handle different data types properly and ensure that the conversion to "int64" is only attempted for compatible data types. Additionally, the logic for checking if the data is in range should be revised to ensure correct results.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, NaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                new_data = data  # If conversion fails, retain original data
        else:
            new_data = data

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should handle different data types properly and ensure that the conversion and date parsing logic is handled correctly. It should also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
