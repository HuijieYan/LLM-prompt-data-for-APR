1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the the github issue.

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for parsing a data array into a date column. The GitHub issue is related to unexpected behavior when parsing a JSON array of bools into a Pandas Series, which is likely related to the date parsing functionality within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it tries to convert the input data into datetime using the `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` line. This could be the source of the unexpected behavior when trying to parse a JSON array of bools, as it seems to be related to converting non-datetime data into datetime.

3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The GitHub Issue information

The bug's cause is likely due to the function's attempt to convert non-datetime data (such as a JSON array of bools) into datetime, which results in unexpected behavior and potentially an error. This is evident from the code of the `_try_convert_to_date` function, and the GitHub issue which mentions the unexpected output of parsing a JSON array of bools.

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.

One approach for fixing the bug could involve adding a check in the function to identify the data type being parsed and only attempting to convert it into datetime if it is of a compatible type. Additionally, handling non-compatible data types separately or raising an appropriate error message could help address the issue.

5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_numeric_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_datetime(data):
        return data, True

    if is_numeric_dtype(data):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(data)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False

# Test the corrected function with the provided GitHub issue example
result, success = _try_convert_to_date(None, pd.Series([True, True, False]))
print(result)  # Expected output: 0    True, 1    True, 2    False
print(success)  # Expected output: True
