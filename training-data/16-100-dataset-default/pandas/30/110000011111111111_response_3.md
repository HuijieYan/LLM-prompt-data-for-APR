The bug in the provided function is caused by the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime, which results in a TypeError. This behavior is not consistent with the expected output of a Series of boolean values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the data type of the input and if it's a boolean Series, return it directly without any conversion to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # check for boolean Series and return as is
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will return the input data as is if it's a boolean Series, and continue with the conversion to datetime for other data types, as previously implemented.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
