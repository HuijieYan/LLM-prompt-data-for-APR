The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect assignment of the variable `new_data` and possible issues with date parsing. Additionally, there are missing imports and references to the 'np' library, which is likely to be NumPy.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the necessary dependencies at the top of the file. Assuming NumPy is needed, add `import numpy as np` to the import section.

2. Correct the assignment of `new_data` by using the `astype` method directly on the data variable rather than reassigning it. This can be done using the `copy` method to create a new copy of the object, then using `astype` directly on it.

3. Ensure that the checks and operations on `new_data` consider the correct data type and handle date parsing appropriately.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected buggy function
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if data.empty:
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data.copy()
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the necessary import is included, the assignment of `new_data` variable is fixed to use the `astype` method directly on the copy of the data, and other operations on `new_data` are modified to handle date parsing and data type checks correctly. This should address the issues observed in the failing test execution and match the expected values and types.
