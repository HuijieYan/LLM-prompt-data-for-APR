1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception". The issue describes how using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` results in a Pandas Series object with datetime values, rather than boolean values as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of the input data to datetime, which is not the intended behavior for the given use case.

3. The bug is caused by the function `_try_convert_to_date` attempting to convert the input data to datetime regardless of whether the input data is a boolean type. This results in datetime values being returned instead of boolean values, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the dtype of the input data and only converting to datetime if the data is not of boolean type.
   - Adding a condition to handle boolean data separately and return it as is, without attempting to convert it to datetime.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # Check if data is of boolean type, return data as is if it is
    if data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False

    # Attempt to convert non-boolean data to datetime
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected function includes a check for boolean data and returns the data as is without attempting to convert it to datetime. It also uses the `pd.to_datetime` function to convert non-boolean data to datetime, handling any errors that may occur during the conversion.
