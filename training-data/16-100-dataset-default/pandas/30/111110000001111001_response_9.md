The issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it is not correctly converting the data to dates as expected.

The problem lies in the logic used to check for the dtype and then convert it to int64. It also checks for whether the in-range values are correct, which is not needed in this case.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic inside the function to only convert the data to int64 if its type is 'object'. We can also remove the unnecessary range check.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype

class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
            new_data = new_data.astype('int64', copy=False)

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected code should now properly convert the data to dates as expected in the provided test cases.
