The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is causing the TypeError. The function is erroneously treating boolean values as dates and trying to parse them. This is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the input datatype and return the input data as is, without attempting to convert it to datetime. It should also handle the case when the input data is a Series and not just an ndarray.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(new_data, np.ndarray) and new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if isinstance(new_data, pd.Series) or issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd._libs.tslib.iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the input data is a Series and return it as is. Then, we perform the necessary checks and conversions for ndarrays. We also use the appropriate pandas functions for checking and converting to datetime.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It will also successfully resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
