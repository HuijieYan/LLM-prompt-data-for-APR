1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is used to try to parse an ndarray into a date column. It attempts to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The function also checks if the numbers are in range and then tries to convert the data to datetime.

2. The potential error location is within the if statement that checks if the dtype of data is "object". There might be issues with data types and conversions in this section of the code.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the data type conversion in the if statement might not be handling all possible cases, leading to errors when trying to convert the data to datetime.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to:
   (a). Check for all possible data types and handle conversions appropriately.
   (b). Add error handling for data type conversions.
   (c). Check for any other potential issues in the code such as variable assignments and comparisons.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce', unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            pass
  
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have used the pd.to_numeric function to convert data to numeric type and then pd.to_datetime to convert it to datetime. We have also added error handling for these conversions using the try-except block. Finally, we return the new_data and True if the conversion is successful.
