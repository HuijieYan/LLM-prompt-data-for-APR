The issue seems to be related to parsing a series of boolean values when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but in older versions of Pandas, it resulted in a Series of datetime objects. In newer versions, it raises a TypeError.

The code contains a `_try_convert_to_date` function that attempts to parse the input data into a date column, but it seems to be incorrectly converting boolean values to datetime objects in some cases.

The function first checks if the data is empty and returns it along with a boolean indicating failure. Then, it attempts to convert the data to int64 if it is of type "object". After that, it checks if the values are in range, and finally tries to parse the data using the `to_datetime` function.

The issue seems to be with the logic for converting data of type "object" to int64, which could be affecting boolean values. Additionally, the comparison with `self.min_stamp` and the use of `in_range` may not be relevant for boolean data.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values correctly and remove unnecessary checks and conversions. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("datetime64[ns]")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    return new_data, True
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the input data has the "object" dtype and then attempts to convert it directly to "datetime64[ns]". The unnecessary checks and comparisons have been removed to simplify the function.

This should fix the bug and ensure that boolean values are parsed correctly when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`.
