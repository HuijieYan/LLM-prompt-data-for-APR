The bug in the provided function is that the 'new_data' variable is being updated in each iteration of the for loop, and then returned if the conversion is successful. However, this means that only the last conversion attempt is being returned, and all previous attempts are overwritten. This causes the function to return incorrect results when multiple conversion attempts are made.

To fix this, we can store the successful conversion in a separate variable and only return it if the conversion is successful.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            np.isnan(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == np.iinfo(new_data.dtype).max)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    successful_conversion = None
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            successful_conversion = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return successful_conversion, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly return the successful conversion if one is found, or the original 'data' if no successful conversion is found. This should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
