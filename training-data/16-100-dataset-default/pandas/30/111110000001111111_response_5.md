Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'new_data' variable and the condition for checking if the data is in range.

Bug Cause:
The function is intended to coerce object types into dates, and ignore numbers that are out of range. However, the handling of the 'new_data' variable is not effectively converting object types into dates, and the condition for checking if the data is in range is not working as expected.

Recommended Fix:
1. Convert the object types into dates using the `to_datetime` function.
2. Check if the data is in range by comparing it with the minimum timestamp value.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype, is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

class Parser():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if is_object_dtype(new_data):
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
            in_range = new_data >= self.min_stamp
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        return new_data, True
```

This corrected function checks for object dtype and numeric dtype separately, then converts the object dtype to datetime and checks for numeric dtype in range, returning the new data and a boolean indicating if the conversion was successful.

This approach satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
