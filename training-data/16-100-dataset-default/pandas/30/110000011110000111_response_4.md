The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date`, which is a method of a class, as indicated by the use of `self`. The function is trying to convert data into a date format but is encountering issues with boolean values.

The failing test is `test_readjson_bool_series`, which is testing the `read_json` function with a JSON string representing a list of boolean values.

The error message indicates that the code is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue confirms that the problem arises when trying to read JSON data into a Series of boolean values, and the expected behavior is to get a Series of bools, not timestamps or an exception. The issue also mentions that this problem is inconsistent with the behavior when `typ="frame"` is used.

To fix the bug, we need to identify when the input data is a list of boolean values and handle it appropriately. We should also ensure that the behavior is consistent with other types and that the correct data type is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(data):
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    if all(isinstance(x, bool) for x in data):  # check if data is a list of booleans
        return data, True  # return the data as is, since it's already in the correct format

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we check if the input data is a list of boolean values and return the data as is with a boolean indicator. If the input data is not a list of bools, the conversion to date is attempted as before.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly when the input data is a list of boolean values.
