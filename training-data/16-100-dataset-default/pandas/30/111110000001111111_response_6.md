The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conversion of boolean values to dates. It is likely that the function is incorrectly converting boolean values to dates, which is not the expected behavior.

The code contains a class named Parser, with a method _try_convert_to_date. This method attempts to parse input data into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, then attempts to coerce object types to int64, and finally tries to convert the data to datetime.

The actual input/output variable information indicates that the new_data variable retains its original value in both cases. Therefore, the issue seems to be with the logic that handles the conversion of object types and the subsequent check for in-range values.

The GitHub issue suggests that when using pd.read_json with typ="series" to read a JSON list of bools, the result is an unexpected output. The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but in older versions, it results in a Series of timestamps, and in newer versions, it raises a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the conversion of boolean values to dates should be handled properly, and the function should return the expected output based on the input type. In this case, when the input is a Series of bools, the function should return a Series of bools.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a Series of boolean values into a date column.
        Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True
        else:
            return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the input is a Series of boolean values, and if so, it returns the data unchanged with a flag indicating successful parsing. Otherwise, it returns the data unchanged with a flag indicating parsing failure. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
