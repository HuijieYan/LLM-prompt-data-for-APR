The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly treating boolean values as dates and trying to convert them to datetime objects. This is causing the code to fail and raise a TypeError. The function should instead return the input data as is, without any conversion.

The potential error location within the function is the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime objects.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the data is of boolean type and if so, return the data as is without any further processing. This will ensure that boolean values are not mistakenly treated as dates and will prevent the TypeError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly handle boolean data and return it as is, without attempting to convert it to date values. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function works as expected for boolean data.
