The issue with the _try_convert_to_date function is that it doesn't correctly handle the conversion of data to date. The function attempts to coerce data into a date format, but it has several issues with type checking and handling exceptions. The function also references variables such as self.min_stamp and self.date_unit, which are not defined within the provided code. Additionally, the use of functions like isna and iNaT suggests that the function has dependencies on other modules or datasets that are not provided.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle the conversion of data to date and also handle exceptions properly.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype
from pandas.errors import OutOfBoundsDatetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a series like object into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.
        Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if is_integer_dtype(new_data.dtype):
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, unit="s")
            except OutOfBoundsDatetime:
                pass
        else:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data)
            except OutOfBoundsDatetime:
                pass

        return new_data, True
```

In the corrected code, we import the necessary modules such as numpy and pandas for the required functions and error handling. We also use the correct type checking methods and exception handling to convert the data to date format. This should fix the issues with the original function and handle the conversion of data to date correctly.
