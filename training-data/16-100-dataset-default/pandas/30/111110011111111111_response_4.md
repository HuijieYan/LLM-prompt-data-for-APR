The issue with the `self._try_convert_to_date` function is that it is incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps. This is causing a TypeError to be raised in the failing test case.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be updated to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them to timestamps. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False
    
        return new_data, True
```

This updated code will handle boolean values separately and will not attempt to convert them to timestamps. It should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
