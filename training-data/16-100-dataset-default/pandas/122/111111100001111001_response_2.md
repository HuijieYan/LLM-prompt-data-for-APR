The bug in the equals function is caused by the incorrect canonicalization of blocks. The function attempts to sort the blocks by type name and manager locations using a custom canonicalize function. This custom function is defined twice in the class, once outside of any function and once within the equals function. This causes confusion and the wrong canonicalize function is used.

To fix the bug, remove the duplicate canonicalize function definition and use the one defined within the class. Additionally, the canonicalize function should properly handle retrieving the mgr_locs attribute from the block.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by using the correct canonicalize function and properly handling the retrieval of mgr_locs from the block. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output for the given test cases.
