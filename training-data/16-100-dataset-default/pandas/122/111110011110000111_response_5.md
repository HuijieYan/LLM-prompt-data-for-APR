Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the equals() method of the BlockManager class. This method is responsible for comparing two BlockManager objects and checking if they are equal.
2. The failing test function test_dataframe_not_equal() creates two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations and expects the equals() method to return False. However, the current implementation returns True, leading to the assertion error.
3. The error message indicates that the actual result is True, which is not expected. This inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue, where the user expected the equals() method to return False but it returned True instead.

Bug Cause:
The equals() method of the BlockManager class fails to consider the blocks' order and locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Sort the blocks in both BlockManager objects based on their order and locations before performing the comparison.
2. Update the equals() method to consider the order and locations of the blocks to determine equality accurately.

Corrected Code for the equals() method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort and compare the blocks based on their type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]
    
    self_blocks = sorted(canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks))
    other_blocks = sorted(canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks))
    
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With the corrected equals() method, the comparison will accurately consider the order and locations of the blocks, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

This corrected code should pass the failing test_dataframe_not_equal() and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
