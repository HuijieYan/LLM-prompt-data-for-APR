1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class, which is used to compare two instances of the class. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it fails to return the expected result. The error message indicates that the method is returning True when it should return False.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals` method. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes which are clearly not equal, but the `equals` method is returning True instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the sorting mechanism for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure it properly reflects the equality of the dataframes.
   - Ensure that the comparison of the sorted blocks in the `equals` method correctly determines the equality of the dataframes.
   - Consider using a different approach for comparing the blocks to accurately determine the equality of the dataframes.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes modifications to the sorting mechanism and the `canonicalize` function. It now accurately determines the equality of the dataframes and should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
