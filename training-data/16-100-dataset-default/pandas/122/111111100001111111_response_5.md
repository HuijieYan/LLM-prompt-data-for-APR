The bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class causes the function to return incorrect results. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` does not consider the actual content of the blocks, leading to a false positive result for identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the actual content of the blocks.

The bug's cause:
- The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class does not properly compare the content of the blocks, leading to false positive results.
- The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` does not consider the content of the blocks, only their locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` needs to consider the actual content of the blocks, not just their locations. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice in the `BlockManager` class, which can lead to ambiguity.

With this in mind, a corrected version of the `equals` method is provided below to fix the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code takes into account the actual content of the blocks when comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
