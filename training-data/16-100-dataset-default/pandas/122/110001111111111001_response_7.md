The buggy function appears to be the `equals` function, which is supposed to check the equality of two objects based on their axes and blocks. The error message from the failing test indicates that the equality check is not passing as expected.

The problematic part seems to be with how the `canonicalize` function is being used to compare the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is meant to return a tuple for comparing the blocks, but there is a discrepancy between expected and actual input/output variable value. It seems that the `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be used as a tuple to compare the blocks, but it is not being handled correctly.

Possible approaches to fix the bug could include correcting the `canonicalize` function to return the expected value for comparing the blocks, and then using this corrected function appropriately within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
