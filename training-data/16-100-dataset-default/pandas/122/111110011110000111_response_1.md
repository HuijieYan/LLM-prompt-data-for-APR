1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure for managing DataFrame, Series, etc. 
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` where the values in columns `a` and `b` are interchanged, and then checks if `df1.equals(df2)` is False.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, showing that the method returned True instead of False.

2. Potential error location:
- The potential error could be in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function, where it compares blocks of self and other and returns True even when the blocks have different locations.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). Buggy function: The `equals` function is comparing block values without considering block locations.
   (b). Buggy class: The `BlockManager` class is responsible for managing labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays, and the `equals` function is used to check equality with another `BlockManager` object.
   (c). Failing test and error message: The failing test is checking for inequality between two DataFrames, but the `equals` function is incorrectly returning True.
   (d). GitHub Issue information: The issue describes the problem with the `equals` function where it returns True for identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the locations of the blocks.
   - Ensure that the comparison returns True only if the blocks are not only identical but also exist in the same location.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks with respect to both values and locations
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs.as_array == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array).all()
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code updates the comparison logic to include checking for identical block locations in addition to checking block equality. This change ensures that the `equals` function returns True only if the blocks are not only identical but also exist in the same location.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
