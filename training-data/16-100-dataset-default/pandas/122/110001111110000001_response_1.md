The buggy function is the `equals` method defined for a Pandas DataFrame. This method checks whether this DataFrame and another DataFrame are equal. The method first checks if the axes (row and column labels) of the two DataFrames are equal. Then it consolidates the two DataFrames in place and checks if the number of internal blocks (for example, blocks for different data types) is equal in both DataFrames. Finally, it uses a custom sorting function to sort the internal blocks and compares them element-wise. 

The bug in the `equals` method is likely caused by the sorting of the internal blocks. The bug appears to stem from the fact that it incorrectly sorts the internal blocks using the `canonicalize` function, and this incorrect sorting leads to a failure in checking for equality.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple that uniquely identifies each block. This could involve combining the block's data type and the content of the block. 

Another fix could be to modify the process of sorting the internal blocks to ensure that they are properly sorted, so that the comparison between the DataFrames is done correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.index.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test.
