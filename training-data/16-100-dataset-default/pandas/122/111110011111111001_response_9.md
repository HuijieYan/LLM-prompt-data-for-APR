The bug in the `equals` function is likely happening due to the sorting of blocks based on type name and then `mgr_locs`. This sorting is causing the comparison between `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` to return `True`, which is incorrect. This is causing the `equals` method to incorrectly return `True` when comparing `df1` and `df2` in the failing test.

To fix this, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the `block` type and sort the blocks using both the block type and `mgr_locs`. Additionally, we need to check if the block types are the same before comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if type(block) != type(oblock) or not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on type and `mgr_locs`, ensuring that the comparison between different types of blocks returns `False`, as expected. This should fix the failing test and the bug in the `equals` function.
