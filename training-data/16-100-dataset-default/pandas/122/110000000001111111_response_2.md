The issue here seems to be with the comparison of the blocks within the `equals` function. The function is sorting the blocks using a canonicalize function and then comparing them. However, it seems that the comparison is not taking into account the block locations.

Looking at the expected output and the actual output, it seems that the function is not handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations correctly, leading to the wrong output.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function without considering the block locations.

The bug's cause is that the function is not effectively comparing identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison of the blocks to also consider the block locations. We can do this by also comparing the block locations in addition to the block types within the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the comparison of the blocks will also take into account the block locations, leading to the correct output for the given test cases. This should also address the issue posted on GitHub.
