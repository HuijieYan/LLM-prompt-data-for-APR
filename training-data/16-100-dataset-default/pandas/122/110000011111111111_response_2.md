The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two 'BlockManager' objects for equality. The function checks if the axes and blocks are equal between the two objects. 

Looking at the failing test for the buggy function, it calls the `equals` method on two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` which should return `False`. However, the test fails and the error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead.

From the failing test information, it is clear that the `equals` method is returning the wrong value, leading to the test failure. This could be due to incorrect handling of the axes and blocks comparison within the `equals` function.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and comparing with the failing test, it seems that the issue might be related to the comparison of block locations within the `canonicalize` function. The incorrect order of the blocks might be leading to the wrong comparison result.

To fix the bug, the canonicalization process, which includes sorting the blocks based on type name and locations, should be carried out properly. Additionally, the comparison of axes and blocks should be revisited to ensure correct comparison logic.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these corrections, the `equals` function should now properly compare the axes and blocks between two 'BlockManager' objects, and the failing test should pass successfully. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
