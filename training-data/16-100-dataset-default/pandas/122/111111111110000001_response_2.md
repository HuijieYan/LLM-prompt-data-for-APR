The buggy function is the equals function within the BlockManager class. The failing test is testing the equality of two dataframes using the equals method, but it fails with an assertion error.

The potential error in the equals function is likely with the comparison of the data blocks. The function sorts the self blocks and other blocks using a custom key (the canonicalize function) and then compares the sorted blocks. However, the canonicalize function is not defined correctly within the BlockManager class. It should be an instance method but is defined as a separate function, causing the incorrect comparison.

The bug occurs because the canonicalize function is not properly defined, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of data blocks within the equals function. This results in the failing test, as the two dataframes are not being correctly compared.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be moved inside the BlockManager class and defined as an instance method. Then, it can be used within the equals function to properly sort and compare the data blocks.

Here is the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define canonicalize as an instance method
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above changes, the equals function should now correctly compare the data blocks and pass the failing test.
