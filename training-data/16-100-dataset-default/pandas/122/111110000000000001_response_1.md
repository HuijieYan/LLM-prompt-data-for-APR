The buggy function is called "equals" and it belongs to the class "BlockManager". This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the length of "self.blocks" and "other.blocks". The function is using "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" without any prior declaration or initialization. It seems like the intended variables were being referenced from the class attributes, but they are not declared within the function.

The bug's cause is that the function is trying to compare "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" without actually defining or initializing these attributes within the "equals" function.

To fix this bug, the "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" should be replaced with references to the class attributes where these variables are defined.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
