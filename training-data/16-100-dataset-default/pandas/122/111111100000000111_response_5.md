1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` file. This function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. The `equals` function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects and then the blocks within them.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The sorting logic may not be correctly identifying identical blocks with different locations as distinct.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the flawed comparison logic for the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function first compares the axes and then attempts to canonicalize the blocks using a sorting mechanism that combines the type name and manager locations into tuples. However, this sorting mechanism may fail to correctly identify identical blocks with different locations as equal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Rework the sorting mechanism to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.
   - Revise the comparison logic for the blocks to eliminate false negatives when comparing the `BlockManager` objects.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Sort the blocks by their dtype and values
    self_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values.tostring()))
    other_blocks.sort(key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values.tostring()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are correctly sorted and compared to identify identical blocks with different locations as equal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
