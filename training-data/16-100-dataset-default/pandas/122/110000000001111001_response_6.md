The issue with the buggy function seems to be in the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is using the attribute mgr_locs, which should be accessed as a property rather than as a method. This is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to correctly access mgr_locs as a property.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
