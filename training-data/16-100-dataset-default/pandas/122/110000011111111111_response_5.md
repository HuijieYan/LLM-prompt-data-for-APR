The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The function is failing because it is not handling the comparison of the blocks correctly, resulting in an incorrect return value and causing the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` to fail.

The bug in the function is occurring in the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The comparison is not being performed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that the `equals` method should return False for two dataframes with different values. However, the actual return value is True, which causes the test to fail.

Based on the GitHub issue description, it is clear that the bug is causing the `equals` method to return incorrect results, leading to unexpected behavior in the test scenario provided.

To fix this bug, the comparison of the block data within the `equals` function needs to be corrected. Instead of simply comparing the tuples of blocks, the contents of the blocks need to be compared in a way that ensures the equality of the dataframes is properly evaluated.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare block data
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```

The corrected `equals` function now properly compares the block data within the `BlockManager` instances, ensuring that the equality of the dataframes is accurately evaluated. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
