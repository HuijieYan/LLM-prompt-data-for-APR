The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to return `True` incorrectly in the case of identical blocks with different locations. Upon analyzing the function and the provided information, it appears that the bug is likely located in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparing them for equality.

The discrepancy in the behavior of the `equals` function is likely due to the incorrect sorting of the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This can result in identical blocks being considered different due to their locations, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to properly sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. Additionally, the sorting logic in the `equals` function should be adjusted to ensure that blocks are compared correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the issue with the sorting logic by converting the block dtype to a string before sorting and ensuring the manager locations are correctly handled.

By using this corrected code, the `equals` function should now return the expected output for the provided input cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
