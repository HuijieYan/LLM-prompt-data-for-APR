The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of `IntBlock` objects without considering the different data types for the 'a' column in the two DataFrames.

The issue arises when comparing the `IntBlock` objects in the `equals` function. It doesn't take into account that the data type of the 'a' column in the two DataFrames is different. This causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the data types of the columns in the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.ftype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Updated to include ftype

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we've updated the `canonicalize` function to include the `ftype` property of the block along with `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to distinguish between different data types in the DataFrames. This change ensures that the comparison takes into account the data types of the blocks, addressing the issue and fixing the bug.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
