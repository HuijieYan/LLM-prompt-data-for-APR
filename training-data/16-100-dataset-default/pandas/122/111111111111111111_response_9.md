The issue is occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality, by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the method currently has a bug where it sometimes returns `True` incorrectly.

The bug is caused by the use of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method, which attempts to order the blocks based on their type and location. However, in some cases, the ordering logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be revised to ensure that it correctly orders the blocks based on their types and locations. Once the ordering logic is fixed, the `equals` method should be able to correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this revised code, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the two `BlockManager` instances and pass the failing test. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the method returns the expected result.
