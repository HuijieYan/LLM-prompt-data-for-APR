The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly referencing the 'block' variable. Since 'block' is defined within the function 'canonicalize', it is not accessible outside of the function. This causes an error when trying to reference 'block' later in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to pass 'block' as a parameter to the 'canonicalize' function, and also update the self_axes and other_axes assignments.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self._get_axes(), other._get_axes()
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, mgr_locs):
        return (block.dtype.name, mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction should fix the bug by correctly referencing the 'block' variable and addressing the scope issue.
