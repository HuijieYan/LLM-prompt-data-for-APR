The buggy function is the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class which compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The method compares the axes and blocks of the two instances for equality and returns False if any difference is found.

The error message from the failing test suggests that the `equals` method is returning True instead of False when comparing two different DataFrames.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when comparing the `block` of each `BlockManager` instance for equality. It seems that the comparison is not happening as expected.

The bug's cause is that the comparison logic inside the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the `block` of each `BlockManager`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the comparison logic for the blocks and ensuring it considers all attributes that need to be compared for block equality.
2. Implementing a custom comparison method for the `block` class if needed.
3. Verifying that the `canonicalize` function is correctly generating the keys for sorting blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected code updates the comparison of blocks by sorting them based on their type and location, and then directly comparing them for equality. This should fix the issue and make the `equals` method return the correct result.
