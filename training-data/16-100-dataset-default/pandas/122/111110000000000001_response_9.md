1. The buggy function "equals" is a method within the "BlockManager" class, which seems to be a class for managing labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays. The function compares two instances of the BlockManager class to determine if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks and then compares each block from one instance with the corresponding block from the other instance.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" compares the blocks from two instances of the "BlockManager" class, but there is a possibility that the blocks may not be sorted in the same order in both instances, which can lead to incorrect comparison results.
   (b). Additionally, the sorting logic used to canonicalize the blocks may not be effective in cases where unconsolidated blocks have the same dtype.name and mgr_locs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Use a more robust method to sort and compare the blocks, taking into consideration the order and unconsolidated blocks.
   (b). Implement a more efficient way to compare the blocks within the "equals" function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (id(block), block)

    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block) for block in other.blocks}

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```
In the corrected code, the "equals" function now compares the blocks using a set of tuples containing the block identity and the block itself, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks are correctly compared. The comparison is done by checking the equality of the sets of blocks, which addresses the sorting and unconsolidated block issues from the previous implementation.
