The buggy function is the equals method of the BlockManager class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. The purpose of this method is to compare two instances of BlockManager and return True if they are equal, and False otherwise.

The failing test test_dataframe_not_equal in the file pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py is attempting to compare two DataFrames using the equals method. The test is failing with the error message "assert True is False".

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes the problem as the equals method returning True when it should return False for instances of DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations.

The potential error location within the equals method is in the comparison of blocks using the canonicalize function. It seems that the function is failing to properly compare the blocks and their locations, leading to the incorrect result.

The bug's cause is likely due to the sorting and comparison of blocks in the equals method. It seems that the canonicalize function may not be properly handling the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the canonicalize function to ensure it correctly identifies and compares blocks.
2. Considering alternative methods for comparing blocks within the equals method.

Here's the corrected code for the equals method of the BlockManager class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array().tobytes(), block.values.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a modified canonicalize function that uses the block's locations and values to create a unique identifier for each block. This should properly handle the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
