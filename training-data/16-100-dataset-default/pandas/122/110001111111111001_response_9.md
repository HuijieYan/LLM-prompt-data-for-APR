The bug in the `equals` function is that it's not properly comparing the contents of the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison is failing because it's comparing different types of data in the two DataFrames.

The issue originates from the way the `equals` function compares blocks and axes in the `BlockManager` objects. The function does not take into account the actual values of the data inside the blocks and axes, leading to incorrect comparisons.

To fix this bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual data values inside the blocks and axes, not just their structures.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function that fixes the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i, ax1 in enumerate(self_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected code compares each axis and block in the `self` and `other` objects for equality, ensuring that the actual data values are compared.

With this correction, the `equals` function will now correctly compare the contents of the `BlockManager` objects, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any issues.
