The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of blocks and the usage of `mgr_locs` to determine the block order. The current implementation of the function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks that are in different locations.

The expected value of `block.mgr_locs` and the type of `block.mgr_locs` are not being met. This discrepancy is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks is correctly determined, taking into account the type name and location of the blocks.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to create a custom comparison function for sorting the blocks based on their type name and location, using `mgr_locs`. We can then use this custom comparison function with the `sorted` function to correctly order the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a custom comparison function for sorting the blocks
    def compare_blocks(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=compare_blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks and return the expected result. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
