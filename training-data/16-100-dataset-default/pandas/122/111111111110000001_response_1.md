The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if two BlockManager instances are equal based on their axes and blocks. The `equals` method calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method before comparing the blocks from the two instances. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to assert that two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method, but it fails with an assertion error.

The potential error in the `equals` method is that it calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both instances before comparing the blocks. This might lead to unnecessary consolidation and may not be required for the comparison.

To fix the bug, we can remove the calls to `_consolidate_inplace` from the `equals` method. Since the comparison is based on the blocks, it's not necessary to consolidate the internal data structures before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should no longer unnecessarily call `_consolidate_inplace` and should pass the failing test.
