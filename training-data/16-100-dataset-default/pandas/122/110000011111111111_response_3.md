The issue with the `equals` function is that it does not correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instance. The function is not checking if the blocks are equal in content, it is just checking for the number of blocks and then sorting and comparing them based on their type and location.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function compares the content of the blocks as well.

Potential error location: The issue lies in the `equals` function's comparison of blocks, where it is only considering the number of blocks and their type.

Bug cause:
(a). The buggy function is not comparing the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
(b). The failing test and error message show that the `equals` function is returning `True` even when the blocks have different content.
(c). The expected input/output variable information indicates that the function needs to compare the content of the blocks, not just the number and type.
(d). The GitHub issue also highlights the problem with the `equals` function returning `True` when the content of the blocks is different.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function to compare the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks, not just their number and type.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i, (block1, block2) in enumerate(zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    return True
```

This updated function checks the content of each block within the `BlockManager` and returns `False` if any of the blocks are not equal. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
