The bug arises from the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function, where the comparison is based on the order of the blocks instead of the content. This can lead to incorrect results, as seen in the failing test case. The function also calls `_consolidate_inplace()` on both `self` and `other` without using the result, which seems unnecessary and can potentially cause issues.

To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks should be based on their content rather than their order, and the call to `_consolidate_inplace()` should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = {block.location: block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {block.location: block for block in other.blocks}

    return all(self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]) for key in self_blocks)
```

In this corrected code:
- The comparison of blocks is based on their content using a dictionary, which allows comparison based on their location.
- The unnecessary call to `_consolidate_inplace()` has been removed.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue presented in the GitHub bug report.
