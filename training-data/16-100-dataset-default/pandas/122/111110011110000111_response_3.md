1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. This method is called when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` function. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with the same columns but in different orders and checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns False, which it should. However, it fails with the error message `assert True is False`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. There seems to be a problem in the way the blocks are being compared, which leads to the method returning True instead of False when it should.

3. The bug's cause is:
   (a). Buggy function: The `equals` method is not correctly comparing the blocks in the two DataFrames.
   (b). Buggy class: The `BlockManager` class contains the `equals` method, which is responsible for comparing blocks within the DataFrames.
   (c). Failing test and error message: The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` tries to compare two DataFrames with the same data but in a different order, and it expects the `equals` method to return False. However, the method returns True, leading to the test failure.
   (d). GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue title and detailed description indicate that the `equals` method is returning True in cases where it should return False, specifically when the blocks have identical data but different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for comparing blocks within the `equals` method.
   - Ensure that the comparison takes into account the order of the blocks and not just their content.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the blocks within the DataFrames and return the expected True or False result. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
