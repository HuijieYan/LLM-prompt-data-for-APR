The buggy function is the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is being called by the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should be expected to return `False`. This points to a potential issue in the logic of the `equals` function.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" provides additional context about the problem, including the expected behavior and the actual behavior, as well as the version information for pandas and other relevant packages.

Upon investigating the buggy `equals` function, it appears that the issue may be in the comparison of blocks. It is important to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are being correctly compared.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be revised so that it correctly handles identical blocks with different locations. This may involve refining the canonicalization process or modifying the comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by canonicalization order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
