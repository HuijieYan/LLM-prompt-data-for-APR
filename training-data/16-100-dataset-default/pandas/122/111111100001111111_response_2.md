Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `equals` function, where it compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue seems to stem from the comparison of blocks with different locations.

Bug's Cause:
The `equals` function is incorrectly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, leading to the failing test case. This issue arises from the comparison of the blocks without considering their locations.

Suggested Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them.
2. Implement a method to canonicalize the block order based on their type name and locations to ensure the correct comparison.

Corrected Code for the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on type name and locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is modified to include the block locations, and the comparison logic is updated to use the canonicalized block order when checking for equality.

The corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
