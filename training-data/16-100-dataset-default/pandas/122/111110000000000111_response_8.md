1. The buggy function "equals" is a method within the "BlockManager" class. This class is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function "equals" is intended to compare two instances of BlockManager. The GitHub issue is reporting that the function returns True for identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks and then checks for equality, but it doesn't handle the case where identical blocks may have different locations.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" attempts to compare two instances of BlockManager by first sorting and then comparing the blocks. However, it doesn't account for the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
   (b). The buggy class "BlockManager" contains the "equals" method, which is where the bug is located. The method is used to compare blocks within two instances of BlockManager.
   (c). The GitHub issue information includes a code sample that demonstrates the issue, along with the expected output and the version information of the libraries used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Introduce a new method to compare blocks within the BlockManager class, which takes into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
   - Modify the existing "equals" method to include additional checks for block locations during the comparison process.
   - Implement a mechanism to normalize block locations before comparing them.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # New function to normalize block locations
    def normalize_block(block):
        return block.values

    # Normalize block locations before comparison
    self_blocks_normalized = [normalize_block(b) for b in self_blocks]
    other_blocks_normalized = [normalize_block(b) for b in other_blocks]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_normalized, other_blocks_normalized)
    )
```
In the corrected code, a new function "normalize_block" is introduced to normalize the block locations before comparison. Then, the comparison is performed using the normalized blocks, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
