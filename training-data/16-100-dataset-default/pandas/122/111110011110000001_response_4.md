The buggy function `equals` is a method inside the `BlockManager` class. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is attempting to compare two dataframes using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. 

The problem lies within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The implementation of the method is incorrect, as it is not properly comparing the two sets of blocks. It is using an incorrect order of block comparison and the comparison itself is flawed.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` for each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting and comparison logic in the `canonicalize` method is also flawed.

The cause of the bug is due to the flawed logic in the `equals` method, which leads to incorrect comparison and sorting of blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be corrected to compare the blocks in a more accurate way based on the dataframes being compared.

The corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.values.shape != other.values.shape:
        return False
    return (self.values == other.values).all()
```

This corrected implementation compares the shape of the values and then compares the values element-wise. This implementation should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
