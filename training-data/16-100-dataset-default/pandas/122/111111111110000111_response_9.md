1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` package. It is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is using the `equals` method to compare two DataFrames and expects it to return `False`, but it actually returns `True`. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, as it evaluated to `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely in the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.

3. Bug cause:
   - The buggy function `equals` is using `sorted` to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs`. This may not accurately reflect the equality of the two `BlockManager` instances, leading to incorrect comparison results.
   - The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is expecting the `equals` method to correctly identify that `df1` and `df2` are not equal, but the comparison logic within the `equals` function is failing to do so.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to accurately identify the equality of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances.
   - Implement a more robust sorting or comparison mechanism for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure that the equality check is accurate.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block_equals = self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i])
        if not block_equals:
            return False

    return True
```

The corrected `equals` function compares the axes of the `BlockManager` instances and then iterates through each block to check for equality. This ensures a more accurate comparison and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
