The issue with the buggy function lies in the comparison of the block order in the `canonicalize` function. The function should take both the type name and the actual block values into consideration for ordering.

The failing test is comparing two DataFrames and expecting them to be not equal. However, the buggy function returns True when it should return False, leading to the assertion error.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of block order in the `canonicalize` function, which results in the `equals` method returning an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should combine the type name and the block values for proper ordering. Additionally, the `equals` method should return False if the block orders are not the same.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` method should now return the correct value and pass the failing test. This should also address the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
