The buggy function is the "equals" function, which compares two DataFrames for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are equal in length, then it iterates through each axis to compare them. Afterwards, it consolidates both DataFrames in place and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it iterates through each block, sorts them, and compares them for equality.

The potential error in the buggy function is that it is trying to call the "_consolidate_inplace" method on both "self" and "other" objects. However, the "_consolidate_inplace" method is not defined anywhere, which is likely causing the error.

The failing test function is "test_dataframe_not_equal", which is testing whether two DataFrames with different values are considered equal or not. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it evaluated to `assert True is False`.

To fix the bug, we should remove the calls to the non-existent method "_consolidate_inplace". Since this method is not defined anywhere, it is unnecessary to call it.

Here's the corrected code for the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the "equals" function should now pass the failing test.
