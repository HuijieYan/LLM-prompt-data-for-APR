The buggy function is the equals() method of a class, with input parameters self and other.

The expected output for the failing test is False, but the actual function returns True when checking for equality between two BlockManager instances. This discrepancy is due to the function incorrectly returning True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The bug's cause is likely the sorting process of self.blocks and other.blocks using the canonicalize function. The sorting might not consider block locations, leading to identical blocks with different locations being mistakenly considered equal.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to include block locations in the sorting process. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are treated as unequal, as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and block data because there might be different blocks with the same data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected False for the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True.
