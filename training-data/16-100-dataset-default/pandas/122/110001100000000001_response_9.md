Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, and the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, which may not return the correct result due to unconsolidated blocks. Additionally, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not effectively distinguish unconsolidated blocks leading to incorrect comparison results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different method for comparing blocks that can handle unconsolidated blocks appropriately.
2. Modify the sorting process using a different criteria that can effectively differentiate unconsolidated blocks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks by labels and put no-consolidated at the end
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: (str(type(b)), b._verify_integrity().mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: (str(type(b)), b._verify_integrity().mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
