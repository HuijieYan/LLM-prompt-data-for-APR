The bug in the provided function is due to the variable `block` being referenced but not defined within the function. It seems that the intention was to use the `self.blocks` variable instead. This is the cause of the discrepancy between the expected and actual values for `block.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs`.

To fix this, we need to update the references to `block` to `self.blocks`, as well as ensuring that the correct attributes of the `IntBlock` are accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.__dict__.values())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and (block.mgr_locs.__dict__.values() == oblock.mgr_locs.__dict__.values()) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the actual values for `block.values.dtype` and `block.mgr_locs` will match the expected values, which will fix the bug.
