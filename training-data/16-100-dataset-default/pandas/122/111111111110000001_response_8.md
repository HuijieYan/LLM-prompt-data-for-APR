1. The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file tests the `equals` function by comparing two DataFrames and expects them to be unequal but it fails.

2. The potential error location is within the comparison logic in the `equals` function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` function is not comparing the DataFrames correctly. The error message indicates that `assert True is False` because the `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic of the comparison within the `equals` function.
   - Ensure that both DataFrames are thoroughly compared, including their individual blocks and axes.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and pass the failing test.
