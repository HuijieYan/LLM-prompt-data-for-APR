1. The buggy function is a method within the BlockManager class, which is used to compare two BlockManager instances for equality. It first checks if the number of axes is the same and then proceeds to compare the axes and individual blocks for equality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the self and other blocks using the equals() method. There may also be an issue with the canonicalize function, as it is used to sort the blocks before comparison.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to compare two BlockManager instances for equality by first comparing the number of axes, then the axes themselves, and finally the individual blocks using the equals() method.

   (b) The BlockManager class contains various functions, including as_array, _consolidate_inplace, equals, and canonicalize, which are utilized within the buggy function.

   (c) The related functions, especially canonicalize, may be causing issues in correctly sorting and comparing the blocks, leading to an incorrect result when determining equality.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include reviewing the implementation of the equals method, ensuring the proper comparison of axes and blocks. Additionally, checking the canonicalize function for any discrepancies that might affect the sorting and comparison process could be beneficial.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks for canonicalize comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected version, the function first compares the axes and consolidates the blocks before sorting and comparing them based on their canonicalized representation. This approach ensures a more accurate comparison of two BlockManager instances for equality.
