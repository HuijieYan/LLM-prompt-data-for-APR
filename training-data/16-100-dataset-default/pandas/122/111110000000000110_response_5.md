The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the pandas library needs to be fixed. The problem arises when comparing two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect result. The issue can be resolved by modifying the `equals` function as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__class__, block.mgr_locs.__class__)

    # Sort blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check if each block is equal
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that identical blocks with different locations are handled properly, and the `equals` function will return the correct result. This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected output when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
