1. The buggy function is a method named "equals" which is used to compare two objects. It relies on other functions like "canonicalize" and "_consolidate_inplace" to perform the comparison.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function appears to be in the "self._consolidate_inplace()" and "other._consolidate_inplace()" lines, as well as in the "canonicalize" function used to sort the blocks.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be that the "self._consolidate_inplace()" and "other._consolidate_inplace()" are being called within a comparison function, which could modify the objects being compared, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the sorting based on "canonicalize" might not be consistent or accurate.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Remove the calls to "_consolidate_inplace" from the "equals" function, as modifying the objects being compared within a comparison function is not advisable.
   b. Ensure that the "canonicalize" function provides a consistent and accurate sorting mechanism.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the calls to "_consolidate_inplace" have been removed from the "equals" function. Additionally, I've corrected the syntax error in "block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()" to "block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()" and then used it in the "canonicalize" function for sorting.
