The buggy function is the equals method, and the issue is related to DataFrame.equals() wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the canonicalize function, which might not consider the block's locations.

The bug's cause is that the equals method for DataFrames is not correctly comparing the blocks when they have different locations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider the block's locations when comparing them.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function modifies the canonicalize function to use the block's mgr_locs directly, which should consider the locations when comparing the blocks.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report by correctly comparing the blocks, taking their locations into account.
