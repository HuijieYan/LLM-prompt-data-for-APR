The buggy function `equals` is intended to check if two DataFrames are equal. However, the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, as indicated by the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue description.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the DataFrame blocks. When comparing the blocks, the code does not take into account that identical blocks might have different locations, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `canonicalize` function to include information about block locations. This will ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not incorrectly marked as unequal.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs and values because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now includes information about block locations and block values. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are properly handled in the comparison, addressing the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
