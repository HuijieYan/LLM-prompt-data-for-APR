The bug is occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function is failing when comparing two DataFrames, as shown in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`. The function is designed to compare two BlockManagers, but in this case, it is being used to compare DataFrames.

The bug is likely occurring in the sorting logic, which depends on the `canonicalize` function for ordering the blocks. The `block` variable inside the `canonicalize` function is incorrectly calling the `mgr_locs` attribute, resulting in a `BlockPlacement` object. This behavior is incorrect, and the incorrect comparison is causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be updated to correctly determine the data type of the block and use it for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using data type for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their data type and values, which is a more accurate comparison for equality. This should address the failing test case and ensure the proper comparison of DataFrames.
