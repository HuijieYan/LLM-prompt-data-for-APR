The buggy function "equals" is a method within the "BlockManager" class. This method is used to check whether two instances of the BlockManager class are equal.

The potential error location within the function is caused by the sorting of the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" using the "canonicalize" function. The "canonicalize" function is not defined within the "equals" method and is supposed to be defined outside the class. This results in a NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Defining the "canonicalize" function outside of the "equals" method and within the "BlockManager" class.
- Removing the "canonicalize" function altogether and finding an alternative method to sort the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks".

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values))
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function has been replaced with lambda functions within the "sorted" method to sort the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks". This eliminates the need for the external "canonicalize" function and resolves the NameError issue.
