Upon analyzing the buggy function and its related test code and error message, it appears that the issue lies in the `equals` function of the DataFrame class. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning True instead of False, which is incorrect. This is the problem reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations."

The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the block where block order is canonicalized and then checked for equality. It seems that the current implementation is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug can be elucidated based on the failing test and error message, which clearly indicates that the `equals` function is not correctly identifying the differences in the block locations, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to modify the block canonicalization process, especially in cases where identical blocks with different locations are encountered. The comparison logic should be updated to properly handle such scenarios. Additionally, the consolidation of blocks should also be revisited to ensure that it does not interfere with the comparison process.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function to address the identified issue:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # comparing blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
With this correction, the `equals` function should now properly handle the comparison of DataFrame objects and pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
