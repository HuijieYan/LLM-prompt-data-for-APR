The buggy function is comparing the 'self' and 'other' BlockManager objects. It first checks if the lengths of their axes are different and then proceeds to consolidate the two objects. After that, it compares the lengths of their blocks and sorts and compares the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs. 

The issue in the code is that it is comparing 'self' and 'other' blocks even if their axes lengths are different. This can result in an error and inconsistent behavior.

To fix this, we can modify the function to first check if the axes lengths are the same. If they are not, we can directly return False. If the lengths are the same, then we can proceed with the comparison and consolidation of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Check if axes are the same, then proceed with comparison
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
