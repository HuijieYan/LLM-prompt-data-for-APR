The bug in the `equals` function is likely being caused by the comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` variables. The function is comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and then attempting to sort their internal blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which is supposed to specify a tuple combining the block's data type and the manager's locations. However, the current implementation of the `canonicalize` function does not account for `BlockPlacement` objects, resulting in the incorrect comparison and subsequent failure of the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle `BlockPlacement` objects and provide a consistent comparison key for the sorting process. 

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function to handle BlockPlacement objects
    def canonicalize(block):
        type_name = str(block.dtype)
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        if hasattr(mgr_locs, 'as_array'):
            return (type_name, mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
        return (type_name, mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle `BlockPlacement` objects correctly in the `canonicalize` function, providing a consistent comparison key for sorting the blocks, which should resolve the issues identified in the failing test.
