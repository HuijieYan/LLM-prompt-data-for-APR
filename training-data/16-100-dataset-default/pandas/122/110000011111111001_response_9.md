The buggy function `equals` is a method of an object, likely from a library such as pandas. The function is used to compare two objects and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison is returning True when it should be False.

From the information provided, it seems that the bug might be related to the comparison of blocks within the objects. The blocks are sorted using the `canonicalize` function, but there may be an issue with the sorting causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we can try updating the `canonicalize` function and/or the sorting process for the blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._consolidate_inplace().blocks
    other_blocks = other._consolidate_inplace().blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version resolves the issue with the block sorting by making use of the `_consolidate_inplace` method to sort the blocks before comparison. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function now includes the type of the block to ensure correct ordering.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
