The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class. This method is called by the test_dataframe_not_equal function in the test_internals.py file. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because `assert True is False`.

The potential error location within the equals method is likely in the comparison logic, where the blocks of self and other are being compared. The logic for comparing the blocks may not be functioning as intended, leading to the incorrect result.

The bug is caused by a flaw in the comparison logic within the equals method. It is failing to properly compare the blocks of the two data frames, which leads to the incorrect assertion in the test.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the equals method needs to be revisited and potentially updated to ensure that the blocks of self and other are being compared correctly.

The corrected code for the equals method within the BlockManager class is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly without sorting them based on type name and mgr_locs. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
