The problem lies in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is currently not being used correctly, which is causing the equality check to fail in certain cases. The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with this assessment.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly process the input block and return a tuple combining the type name and the locations of the block. Additionally, the `equals` function should use the modified `canonicalize` function to compare the blocks and ensure their equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
