The error occurs because the `BlockManager` class does not have a `blocks` attribute, which is being accessed in the `equals` function. This causes the function to throw an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `blocks` attribute should be accessed from the `BlockManager` class itself rather than the instance. Additionally, `block` should be accessed as `self.blocks` and `oblock` should be accessed as `other.blocks` within the for loop.

Corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above changes, the `equals` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
