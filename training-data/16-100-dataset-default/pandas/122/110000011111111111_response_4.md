The issue seems to be related to the DataFrame.equals() method returning True when comparing dataframes with identical blocks but in different locations. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the comparison of two dataframes with different values to return False, but it returns True instead.

The bug is likely located within the equals() method where it checks for the equality of axes and blocks. The discrepancy between the expected and actual output values in the failing test likely stems from the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential cause of the bug is the canonicalization of block order using the dtype name and mgr_locs, which might result in identical blocks being ordered differently and causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to ensure that identical blocks are ordered in a consistent manner, regardless of their locations. This can be achieved by considering only the dtype name for canonicalization, without including mgr_locs.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Fixing the canonicalize function to consider only dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
