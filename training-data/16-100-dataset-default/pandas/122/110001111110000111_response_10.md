1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is the equals() function in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py
   - The function compares two DataFrames by comparing their axes and blocks.
   - The related functions are as_array(), _consolidate_inplace(), dtype(), and canonicalize().
   - The failing test test_dataframe_not_equal() creates two DataFrames with different column order and asserts that df1.equals(df2) is False.
   - The error message indicates that the assertion df1.equals(df2) is False fails and actually returns True.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the comparison of blocks and the canonicalization of block order using the canonicalize() function.

3. Bug's Cause:
   - The buggy function compares DataFrame blocks without considering the order of the columns.
   - The failing test creates two DataFrames with columns in different orders, causing the function to incorrectly return True.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the equals() function to consider the order of the columns when comparing blocks.
   - Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the equals() function takes into account the column order.

5. Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the equals() function now correctly accounts for the column order when comparing DataFrame blocks. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
