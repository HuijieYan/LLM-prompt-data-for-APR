The issue in the `equals` function is that it's comparing blocks with different locations. To fix this, we need to make sure that the block locations are properly handled during the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the data to ensure proper comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks using a canonicalized key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the block locations are handled correctly and the comparison is done after consolidating the data. This should fix the issue and make the `equals` function work as expected.

After making these changes, the failing test should now pass, and the `equals` function should behave correctly when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.
