1. The buggy function is "equals" from the "BlockManager" class in the "pandas/core/internals/managers.py" file. This function is called within the "BlockManager" class and is related to other methods within that class, such as "_consolidate_inplace" and "canonicalize". The function compares two BlockManagers for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the "self_axes" and "other_axes". 

3. The cause of the bug could be that the "self_axes" and "other_axes" are compared for equality without checking if they have the same length. Additionally, the comparison of "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" is done without first consolidating them in place, which may lead to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if the length of "self_axes" and "other_axes" is the same before comparing them for equality.
   b. Consolidate "self.blocks" and "other.blocks" in place before comparing them.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
