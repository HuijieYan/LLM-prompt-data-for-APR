The buggy function seems to be comparing two BlockManager objects, possibly representing dataframes or arrays. The function attempts to check if the axes of the two objects are the same, as well as the blocks within the objects.

The issue appears to be with the comparison of the blocks. The function is attempting to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations and then compare them, but the comparison logic seems to be flawed.

The bug's likely cause is the faulty comparison logic when comparing the blocks of the two BlockManager objects.

To fix the bug, you could modify the comparison logic when comparing the blocks of the two BlockManager objects. Specifically, you could compare each individual block without attempting to sort or canonicalize them.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function directly compares the blocks of the two BlockManager objects without attempting to sort or canonicalize them based on their dtype name and manager locations. This should address the comparison logic issue and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
