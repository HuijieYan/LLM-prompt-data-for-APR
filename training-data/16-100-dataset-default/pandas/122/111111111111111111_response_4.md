Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the sorting of the blocks using the canonicalize function.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function incorrectly identified the dataframes df3 and df4 as equal even though they contain different data. This is due to the way the block order is canonicalized using the canonicalize function, which does not take into account the unique values of the blocks.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the canonicalize function to also consider the unique values of the blocks while sorting.
2. Update the sorting logic for the blocks to properly take into account the values of the blocks to ensure correct comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order considering the block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The above corrected code now takes into account the unique values of the blocks when sorting them to ensure a proper comparison. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and also pass the failing test.
