1. The buggy function is `equals` which is a method of the `BlockManager` class. This function is being called by the users of the DataFrame class to check if two DataFrames are equal. The GitHub issue points out that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames. It uses the `sorted` function to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This can lead to incorrect comparison results, as identical blocks with different locations may still be considered equal.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `equals` function compares the blocks of two DataFrames, but it sorts the blocks using the `sorted` function based on their type name and manager locations, potentially leading to incorrect results.
   (b). The `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` functions are called within the `equals` function, but their implementations are not provided here.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides an example where the `equals` method returns True when it should have returned False, indicating the bug in the code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Instead of sorting the blocks based on type name and manager locations, compare the blocks directly to check for equality.
   - Verify the implementations of the `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` functions to ensure they are functioning correctly and not contributing to the bug.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks))
```
This corrected function directly compares each block of the two DataFrames for equality, eliminating the need for block sorting and addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
