1. The buggy function 'equals' is supposed to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal, otherwise False. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two DataFrames. The comparison of axes checks if the lengths are equal and if all axes are equal. The comparison of blocks sorts and compares the blocks of the two DataFrames.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of axes and the sorting and comparison of blocks.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function compares axes by calling the 'equals' method for each pair of axes. 
   (b). The 'equals' method used for comparing axes is not the correct method, resulting in incorrect comparison.
   (c). The GitHub issue states that the buggy function returns True even when the blocks of the two DataFrames are identical but have different locations, which indicates a problem with sorting and comparing the blocks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Use a different method for comparing axes, such as comparing the axes directly without calling the 'equals' method.
   (b). Implement a custom sorting and comparison method for the blocks, considering the block order and locations for a more accurate comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if self_axes[i] != other_axes[i]:
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort and compare blocks based on their type name and locations
    def sort_and_compare_blocks(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        sorted_self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        sorted_other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks)
        )

    return sort_and_compare_blocks(self.blocks, other.blocks)
```

In the corrected code:
- The comparison of axes directly checks if the axes are equal without calling the 'equals' method.
- A custom sorting and comparison method 'sort_and_compare_blocks' is implemented to ensure accurate comparison of blocks based on type name and locations.

This corrected code resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug by addressing the incorrect comparison of axes and providing a more accurate sorting and comparison method for the blocks.
