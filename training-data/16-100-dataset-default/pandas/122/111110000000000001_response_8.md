The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class, which takes another `BlockManager` object `other` as a parameter and checks for equality between the two objects.

The potential error in the problematic function is at the point of comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. It seems that the blocks are being sorted and then compared for equality, but the comparison logic might not be correct.

The bug likely results from the incorrect comparison logic, which may arise due to the improper handling of the blocks' equality check.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to compare the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` element-wise, rather than directly comparing their blocks in the way currently implemented.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
