1. The buggy function is the `equals` method of a DataFrame object in the pandas library. This method is used to compare two DataFrames and check if they are equal.

2. The potential error location within the function is when comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. The method tries to sort the blocks using a custom key function, but this can lead to incorrect comparisons due to different block locations.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The buggy function `equals` does not handle the case where identical blocks in two DataFrames may have different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results.
   (b) The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` demonstrates this issue by creating two DataFrames with identical data but different column orders and asserting that the `equals` method should return False, which fails.
   (c) The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" further explains the issue and provides a test case, version information, and expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations.
   - Update the sorting mechanism for blocks to ensure correct comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks using a stable sorting mechanism
    self_blocks = sorted(
        [(i, block) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)],
        key=lambda x: (x[1].dtypes.name, x[1].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    other_blocks = sorted(
        [(i, block) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)],
        key=lambda x: (x[1].dtypes.name, x[1].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    )
    
    return all(
        self_blocks[i][1].equals(other_blocks[j][1])
        for i, j in zip(range(len(self_blocks)), range(len(other_blocks)))
    )
```

The corrected code includes a stable sorting mechanism for the blocks of the DataFrames, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared. This updated code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
