1. The buggy function appears to be a method for the DataFrame class in Python's pandas library. The issue posted on GitHub relates to the equals() method of the DataFrame class returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the way it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames, leading to the equals() method returning True when it should return False in the presence of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the code and the GitHub issue, where a simple test case yields an unexpected True result.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Revising the way the function compares the blocks of the two DataFrames to account for differences in locations.
   - Ensuring that the comparison properly handles cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the canonicalize() function now uses block.values instead of block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() to identify the blocks, which should help properly distinguish between identical blocks with different locations. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
