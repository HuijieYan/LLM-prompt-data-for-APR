1. The buggy function compares two objects by iterating over their axes and blocks and then sorting and comparing the blocks. It also calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function for both objects before comparing the blocks, and it uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their type and location.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the sorting and comparison of the blocks, or it could be in the implementation of the `canonicalize` function.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be due to inconsistencies in the sorting and comparison of the blocks. There might also be an issue with the implementation of the `canonicalize` function that could result in incorrect comparison of the blocks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the sorting and comparison of the blocks is done accurately, and revisiting the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to make sure it correctly identifies the distinguishing characteristics of the blocks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `as_array` function has been replaced with `to_list`, as 'as_array' didn't seem to exist in the given code context. The function now compares the lengths and contents of the axes of both objects, ensures consolidation of the blocks, and accurately sorts and compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.
