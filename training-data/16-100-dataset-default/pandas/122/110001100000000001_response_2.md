The buggy function appears to be comparing two objects using their axes and blocks. It then attempts to canonicalize the blocks and compares them.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block comparison using the `equals` method. It also seems there is an unnecessary repetition of the `canonicalize` function.

The potential cause of the bug could be that the comparison of blocks is not being handled correctly, or the canonicalization of blocks is not accurately reflecting their equality.

To fix the bug, one possible approach could be to first check if the axes are equal, then compare the blocks directly without canonicalizing. Additionally, to remove the unnecessary repetition of the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
