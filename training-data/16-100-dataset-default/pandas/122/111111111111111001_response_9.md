The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly compare two dataframes for equality. It sorts the blocks within the dataframes and then tries to compare them, but it fails to consider the values within the blocks when doing the comparison.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the values within the blocks of both dataframes after sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison considers the actual data within the dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison considers the values within the blocks of both dataframes, as well as their types and indices.
