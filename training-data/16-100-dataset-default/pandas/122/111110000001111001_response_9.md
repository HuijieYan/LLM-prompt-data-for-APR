The main issue in the buggy function appears to be with the sorting of self.blocks and other.blocks.

In the buggy function, the code is trying to sort the blocks based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs. However, the 'block' variable inside the 'canonicalize' function is not defined. It seems that 'block' should be an item from the 'self.blocks' list.

To fix this issue, we need to iterate over the blocks in the 'self.blocks' and 'other.blocks', and then sort them based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort self.blocks and other.blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def sort_blocks(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks_sorted = sort_blocks(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks in 'self' and 'other' based on their dtype.name and mgr_locs, and return the expected output for the given input parameters.
