1. The buggy function is a method called `equals` within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to check if two block managers are equal. It seems that the problem lies in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It is clear that the comparison logic is not correctly implemented, leading to the incorrect result.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class contains the logic for comparing two block managers.
   (b). The related functions include various methods within the same `BlockManager` class that are called within the `equals` function.
   (c). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` attempts to compare two dataframes and expects the result to be False, but due to the bug, it fails.
   (d). The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True instead of False for the comparison of two dataframes.
   (e). The GitHub issue provides the expected behavior where the `equals` method should return False for the given test case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Refactor the comparison logic within the `equals` method to ensure correct comparison of blocks.
   (b). Ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks are done in a way that accurately reflects the equality of the block managers.
   (c). Consider using existing pandas methods for comparison where possible to avoid re-implementing comparison logic.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__array_interface__["typestr"], block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a modified `canonicalize` function that now considers the block's type and locations to form a unique identifier for comparison. It then ensures that the blocks are sorted based on this unique identifier before performing the comparison.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
