1. The buggy function is a method for comparing two objects. It checks if the axes, blocks, and blocks' content of two objects are equal.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks' content. The function sorts the blocks using a custom key function but then compares the unsorted blocks.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is sorting the blocks using a custom key function but then comparing the unsorted blocks, rendering the sorting process ineffective.

4. The possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Sorting both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` with the same key function and comparing them afterward.
   (b) Revising the comparison process to consider the sorted order of the blocks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
