The buggy function is a method for comparing two objects of the same class. It is currently part of the pandas library, and the failing test function is a part of the test suite for this library. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrame objects, df1 and df2, and expects them to be not equal. However, the current implementation of the equals method does not correctly identify the inequality between the dataframes.

The potential error location within the equals method is the logic for comparing the blocks of the two objects.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the two dataframes. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which might lead to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to directly compare the values of the two dataframes instead of comparing the blocks. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not self.index.equals(other.index) or not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
        return False

    return self.values.tolist() == other.values.tolist()
```

With this corrected implementation, the failing test should pass.
