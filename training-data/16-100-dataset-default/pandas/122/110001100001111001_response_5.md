The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the `block` variable not being properly defined or accessed within the function. It seems that the `block` variable is intended to refer to the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. However, it is not defined within the function, which can lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `block` variable is properly defined and used to access the blocks within the tuples `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function outside of the main function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Use the sorted() function to sort the blocks using the canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    # Use the zip() function to compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should properly define and use the `block` variable and address the bug in the function. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
