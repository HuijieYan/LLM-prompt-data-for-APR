1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to check if two objects are equal. It compares the axes and blocks of the two objects and returns False if they are not the same.

2. The potential error location is in the if statement that checks for equality of each axis using the equals() method.

3. The bug's cause is that the equals() method is not being called on the axes properly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equals() method is called correctly on the axes.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1 == ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, I replaced `ax1.equals(ax2)` with `ax1 == ax2` which should compare the axes correctly.
