1. The buggy function is the `equals` function which is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should return False.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the comparison of the blocks of the DataFrames. It appears that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

3. (a). The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare the DataFrames' axes and blocks to determine equality.

   (b). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that they are not equal. The error message indicates that the function is returning True instead of False.

   (c). The GitHub issue provides additional context, stating that when running a simple test, the function returned True instead of False, which was unexpected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the block comparison logic in the `equals` function to accurately compare the blocks of the DataFrames.
   - Ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual values within the blocks rather than just their order or locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.values.tostring())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of blocks has been improved to accurately compare the actual values within the blocks, instead of just their order or locations. This will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
