The potential error location within the buggy function is in the canonicalization process of the blocks. It seems that the comparison of the blocks and their order is generating an incorrect result.

The bug's cause is related to the block canonicalization process, which is used to determine if two BlockManager objects are equal. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs, which might lead to incorrect comparisons.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to properly extract the values of dtype and mgr_locs from the block objects. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the correct order and values for equality.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.values)  # Use type(block) as a part of canonicalization

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes changes to the canonicalize function to use type(block) as part of the canonicalization process. Additionally, the comparison of blocks now considers the equality of block objects based on their values.

This change should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the equals function properly compares the BlockManager objects and returns the correct result.
