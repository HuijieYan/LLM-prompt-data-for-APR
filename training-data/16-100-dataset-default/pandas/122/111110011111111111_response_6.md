The problematic function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function is used to check whether two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The issue is that the function incorrectly returns True when the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are identical but located in different positions.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is testing the equality of two `DataFrame` objects, which in turn calls the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The test fails because the `equals` function returns True when it should return False.

The input parameters `self_axes`, `other_axes`, `block.dtype`, `block`, and `block.mgr_locs` are all as expected. However, the issue appears to be with the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function, which causes it to incorrectly return True for identical blocks in different positions.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic within the `equals` function needs to be adjusted. The comparison should not be influenced by the positions of the blocks, as long as the content of the blocks is identical.

Based on the analysis, the corrected code for the `equals` function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code changes the way the blocks are sorted. Instead of using the `canonicalize` function, it uses a lambda function to sort the blocks based on the values they contain. This ensures that the comparison of blocks is not influenced by their positions.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now return False as expected for the failing test case, and also satisfy its input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
