The problematic function is the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to compare two DataFrames for equality.

The potential error in the function is the use of `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()`. These lines attempt to call a method on `self` and `other`, but since `consolidate_inplace` has not been defined within the class, it results in an AttributeError.

The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` from `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. It creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`, where the values in 'a' and 'b' columns are different in the two DataFrames. The assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because the `equals` function does not handle the case where the values in the columns are different.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the lines `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` as they are causing the AttributeError.
2. Modify the logic of the `equals` function to compare the values in the DataFrames to check for equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all((self_blocks[i] == other_blocks[i]).all() for i in range(len(self_blocks)))
```

This corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test.
