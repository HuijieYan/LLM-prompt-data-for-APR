The bug in the function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of block dtype and mgr_locs. The canonicalization function is not correctly handling the mgr_locs comparison, leading to incorrect sorting of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to include a comparison of mgr_locs. Additionally, the sorting should be based on the dtype and mgr_locs tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function ensures that the block comparison is done based on the dtype and mgr_locs, taking into account the input/output variable information provided in the expected cases.
