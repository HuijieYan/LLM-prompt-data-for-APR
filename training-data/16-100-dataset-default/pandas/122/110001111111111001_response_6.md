The bug in the `equals` function stems from the `canonicalize` function, which is being redefined within the `equals` function. This redefinition is unnecessary and causes issues when trying to call `canonicalize` later in the function. It leads to the `block.mgr_locs` value being accessed incorrectly, resulting in the failing test.

To fix this bug, remove the unnecessary redefinition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. This will ensure that the `canonicalize` function is properly accessible when it is called later in the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=_canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=_canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is not redefined within the `equals` function, and the `_canonicalize` function is used to avoid naming conflicts. This will ensure that the `canonicalize` function is properly accessed, resolving the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test.
