1. The buggy function `equals` is inside the class `BlockManager` and is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The function checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, consolidates the instances in place, and then compares the blocks within the instances for equality.

2. The potential error location in the problematic function is the comparison of blocks after sorting them based on their type name and manager locations.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling identical blocks with different locations correctly. This is evident from the GitHub issue where a simple test failed to return the expected result of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is due to the sorting of blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which results in incorrect comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the block comparison logic to handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, such as comparing the actual data within each block instead of sorting them based on type and location.
   - Ensuring that the equality comparison is done using a robust method that considers blocks with the same data but different locations as equal.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare blocks directly
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of blocks is done directly without sorting based on type name and manager locations. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are compared correctly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
