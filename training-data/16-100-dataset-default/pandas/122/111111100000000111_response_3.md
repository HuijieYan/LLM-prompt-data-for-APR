1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. It also utilizes a function `canonicalize` to sort and compare the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the function does not correctly handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations, which leads to incorrect equality checks.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. Additionally, the GitHub issue indicates that when the source code is tested, it fails to return the expected result of `False` for identical blocks with different locations. This suggests that the `equals` function is not handling block comparison accurately.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations in addition to block content.
   b. Modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` function to account for potential block location differences.
   c. Ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include block location in the canonicalization process
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    # Sort blocks using canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes an updated `canonicalize` function that considers block locations in addition to block content, and modifies the comparison logic to account for potential block location differences. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
