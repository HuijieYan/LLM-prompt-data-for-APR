The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is called to check for equality between two different DataFrames.

From the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal`, we can see that when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

The error message from the failing test shows that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should not.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that the `equals` function is not returning the expected `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is where it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames after sorting them. There may be an issue with how the sorting and comparison of the blocks are being performed.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to correctly handle the comparison of blocks in a way that accounts for their content and location.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values.flags, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the sorting of blocks based on their content and location, and then compares the blocks to determine equality. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function return the expected result, passing the failing test and resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.
