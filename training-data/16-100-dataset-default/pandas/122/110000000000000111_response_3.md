1. The buggy function is the `equals` method for a DataFrame in Pandas. It is used to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal. The GitHub issue is reporting that the method is returning True even when the DataFrames have different column orders, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks between the two DataFrames. It seems that the function does not properly handle cases where the blocks have the same data but are located in different positions within the DataFrame.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not take into account the position of the blocks when comparing them. This causes it to return True even when the blocks have different locations within the DataFrames. The issue reported on GitHub confirms this behavior.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - The function should be modified to consider the order of the blocks when comparing them. This can be done by adding logic to handle the comparison of blocks with different locations within the DataFrame.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks with their locations
    for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```
