1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to determine if two `BlockManager` objects are equivalent. It compares the axes and blocks of the two objects to check for equality.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of block equality between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. This comparison does not take into account the order of the blocks, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. Bug cause:
   (a) The buggy function `equals` compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects without taking into account the order of the blocks.
   (b) The `BlockManager` class contains several methods such as `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` that are used within the `equals` function.
   (c) The related functions are used for internal operations within the class and are not directly related to the bug.
   (d) The GitHub issue information states that the `equals` function incorrectly returns True when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Modify the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function to consider the order of the blocks.
   (b) Update the `canonicalize` function to properly handle block ordering for comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()) for block in blocks]

    self_sorted_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_sorted_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    return all(
        block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- The `canonicalize` function has been updated to properly create a sorted representation of the blocks to compare them in the `equals` function.
- The comparison of blocks is now done using the sorted representations to account for the block order.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
