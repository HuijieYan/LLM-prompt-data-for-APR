The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The function checks if two DataFrames are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different values and asserts that the `equals` method returns `False`, but it fails.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. This comparison is not correctly handling the block order, leading to incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` method, which does not handle different block orderings properly. This causes the method to return `True` when it should return `False`. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem and an expected output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Sorting the blocks before comparison to ensure a consistent order.
2. Implementing a more robust comparison method for the blocks to handle different orderings.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected code, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and correctly identify when two DataFrames are not equal. The corrected function addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and provides the expected output.
