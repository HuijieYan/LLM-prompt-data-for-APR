1. The buggy function in the given code is the "equals" method within the BlockManager class. This method is called to check if the content of two dataframes are the same. The relationship between this method and the GitHub issue is that the "equals" method is not returning the expected output when comparing two identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it compares the blocks of the two dataframes. It seems that the comparison does not take into consideration the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" is comparing the blocks of the two dataframes without considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
   (b). The BlockManager class contains the "equals" method, which is called by the dataframes to check for equality.
   (c). The GitHub issue information states that the "equals" method is returning True when comparing two identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic in the "equals" method to consider the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
   - Implement a new approach to compare the blocks of the two dataframes, taking into account the potential difference in block locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.items())))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes a new approach to compare the blocks of the two dataframes, taking into account the potential difference in block locations. The "canonicalize" function now creates a tuple of block type name and sorted block locations, which is used to compare the blocks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
