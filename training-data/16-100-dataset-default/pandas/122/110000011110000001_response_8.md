1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames in pandas. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is attempting to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method and expecting the comparison to return `False`. However, the error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of the `DataFrame` blocks.

3. (a) The buggy function `equals` compares the blocks in the DataFrames using the `equals` method. If the blocks have different data types or if there are unconsolidated blocks, the comparison may not work as expected.
   (b) The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is creating two DataFrames with columns of different data types and expecting the comparison to return `False`. However, the comparison is returning `True` instead, causing the test to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `equals` function to check for the data type of the values in the DataFrames and compare them accordingly. Additionally, we can consolidate the blocks in the DataFrames before performing the comparison to ensure consistent behavior.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.values.dtype == oblock.values.dtype and block.equals(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
