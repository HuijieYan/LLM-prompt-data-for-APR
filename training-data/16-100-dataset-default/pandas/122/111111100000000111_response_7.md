1. The buggy function is a part of the BlockManager class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function compares two BlockManager objects and checks if they are equal. It does so by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the comparison of blocks after sorting them. This comparison may fail because the comparison of blocks with identical data but different locations may not yield the correct result.

3. The bug's cause is related to the comparison of blocks after sorting them. The function fails to correctly identify the equality of blocks with identical data but different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement a custom comparison method for blocks that takes into account their data and location.
   - Avoid sorting the blocks based only on data type and location, but also include the actual values of the blocks in the comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a custom comparison method for blocks that considers not only their data type and location but also their actual values. This would ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as equal.
