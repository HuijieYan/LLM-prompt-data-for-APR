The bug in the function is that the `block` variable being used within the function has not been defined. It appears to be referring to a loop variable, but it is not explicitly defined within the function. This is likely causing the function to raise an error.

To fix this bug, the `block` variable should be defined within the function, and the function should be modified to use it correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this change, the function should now work correctly and produce the expected output for the given input parameters.
