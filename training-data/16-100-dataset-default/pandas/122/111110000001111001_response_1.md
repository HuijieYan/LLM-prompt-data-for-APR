The bug in the provided function is the missing 'self' parameter in the 'canonicalize' function. The 'canonicalize' function is defined within the 'equals' method, and it references 'block' directly without passing it as a parameter. This results in a NameError when 'canonicalize' is called, as 'block' is not defined within its scope.

To fix the bug, the 'canonicalize' function should accept 'block' as a parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the 'equals' function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the 'block' variable is now passed as a parameter to the 'canonicalize' function, resolving the NameError and ensuring the function operates as expected.
