The bug in the function seems to be caused by the use of the 'block' variable without it being defined within the 'equals' function. The variable 'block' seems to be coming from the 'canonicalize' function, but it is not defined within the 'equals' function. This leads to a NameError when the code is run.

To fix the bug, the 'block' variable needs to be defined within the 'equals' function or passed as an argument to the 'equals' function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

With this modification, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing case.
