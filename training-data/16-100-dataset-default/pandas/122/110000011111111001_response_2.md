The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the same type class. However, it fails to properly compare the internal properties of both instances, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` utilizes the `equals` method to compare two dataframes and expects the comparison to return `False`. However, the method returns `True` instead, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the block where it checks the equality of blocks from `self` and `other` using the `equals` method. This comparison is not accounting for the order of blocks, which could lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison correctly takes into account the order of blocks and returns the expected comparison result.

Here's the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = list(sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize))
    other_blocks = list(sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use the `canonicalize` function to ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in a consistent order. This corrects the order discrepancy issue, ensuring that the comparison is performed accurately.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
