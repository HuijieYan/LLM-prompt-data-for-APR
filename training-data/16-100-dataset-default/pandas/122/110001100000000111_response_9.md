1. The buggy function equals() is meant to compare two DataFrame objects for equality. It first compares the axes and if they are not equal, it returns False. Then it checks if the blocks are equal, but the approach it takes to canonicalize block order is flawed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the canonicalize block order part, where the function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and the mgr_locs. However, this might not accurately represent the equality of the blocks.

3. The bug's cause is that the canonicalize function used for sorting the blocks is not accurately representing the equality of the blocks. This leads to cases where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered as equal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Improve the canonicalize function to accurately represent the equality of the blocks.
   b. Use a different approach to compare the blocks for equality.

5. 
```python
# Fix for the buggy function equals()

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        # Use the block values as a canonical representation for sorting
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This solution improves the canonicalize function to use the block values as a canonical representation for sorting the blocks. This ensures that identical blocks with different locations are accurately compared for equality.
