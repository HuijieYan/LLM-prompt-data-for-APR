Based on the error message and the input/output variable information provided, it seems that the issue lies in the `equals` function's comparison of blocks in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The function seems to incorrectly compare the blocks' locations, resulting in a false positive for the equality check in the failing test case.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their type name and then `mgr_locs`. This sorting operation might not be appropriate for determining block equality.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to sort the blocks more accurately based on their content, and the comparison logic should be adjusted to properly check for block equality.

The corrected code for the `equals` function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update the canonicalize function to sort the blocks based on their content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return hash(block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should effectively fix the bug by properly sorting and comparing the blocks for equality, satisfying both the failing test and the expected input/output variable information. This resolution should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
