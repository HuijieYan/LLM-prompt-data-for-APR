Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. This function is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames and checks if they are equal using the `equals` function. The expected result is False, but it is failing.
3. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning True instead of False, leading to the assertion error.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem as "DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations", and it includes a code sample and the expected output.

Bug Cause:
The `equals` function is not correctly comparing the `BlockManager` objects. It may be ignoring the location of identical blocks, leading to incorrect results.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `equals` function to consider the location of blocks while comparing.
2. Ensure that the function sorts and compares the blocks based on their type and locations.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Import required library
import pandas as pd

# Define the corrected equals function inside the BlockManager class
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class code)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Define the key function to sort blocks based on type and location
        def canonicalize_key(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        # Sort the blocks of both objects using the key function
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_key)
        
        # Compare sorted blocks
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using the corrected `equals` function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass.
