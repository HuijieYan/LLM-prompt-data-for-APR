1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of the class and their blocks, but there is a flaw in the comparison logic. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False. However, the actual output is `True is False`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to compare the blocks of the two instances of the `BlockManager` class.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `equals` method in the buggy class compares two instances of the class and their blocks.
   (b). The `test_dataframe_not_equal` test creates two dataframes with different column order and expects the `equals` method to return False, but it fails.
   (c). The error message indicates that the comparison result is unexpectedly True.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides the expected output and the versions of pandas and other relevant libraries.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to correctly compare blocks and return the expected result.
   - Check for inconsistencies in block order and data types within the `equals` method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._type, block._data.as_array().tobytes()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._type, block._data.as_array().tobytes()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code will compare the blocks of the two instances of the `BlockManager` class in a consistent manner, addressing the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
