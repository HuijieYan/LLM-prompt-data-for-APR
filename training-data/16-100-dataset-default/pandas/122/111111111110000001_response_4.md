1. The buggy function is called "equals" and is defined within the "BlockManager" class in the "pandas/core/internals/managers.py" file. The function is meant to compare two instances of the BlockManager class, but the implementation appears to be incorrect, as indicated by the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py" file. The failing test is asserting that the "equals" function should return False for two DataFrames that have different values for the same columns.

2. The potential error in the buggy function can be identified within the part where it compares the individual blocks of the two instances using the "canonicalize" function.

3. (a). The buggy function "equals" is the main focus, which is part of the "BlockManager" class. It compares the attributes and blocks of two instances of the class.
   (b). The "BlockManager" class contains several other functions, including "as_array", "_consolidate_inplace", and "canonicalize", which are called within the "equals" function.
   (c). The related functions provide support for the operations performed in the "equals" function, such as array manipulation and block consolidation.
   (d). The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is attempting to compare two DataFrames using the "equals" function, but it fails with an assertion error because the "equals" function does not return the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the comparison logic within the "equals" function, particularly the part where it compares individual blocks.
   - Check the sorting and canonicalizing logic to ensure that it properly handles different block orders and types.
   - Make sure that the comparison of individual blocks is correct and aligned with the expected behavior of the function.
   - Verify that the support functions such as "as_array" and "_consolidate_inplace" are functioning as intended and are used correctly within the "equals" function.

5. Corrected code for the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code addresses possible issues with the comparison logic and ensures that the "equals" function correctly compares the BlockManager instances, satisfying the failing test.
