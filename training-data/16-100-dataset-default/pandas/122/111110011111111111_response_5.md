The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the BlockManager class and return True if they are equal. However, the function is currently not working as expected and is returning True even when the two BlockManagers are not equal.

It seems that the issue lies in the way the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort and compare the blocks of the two BlockManagers. The current implementation of the `canonicalize` function is likely not producing the expected result, leading to the incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to correctly produce the canonical representation of the blocks. Additionally, the sorting and comparison logic using the canonical representations should be adjusted to properly determine the equality of the two BlockManagers.

Based on the failing test and the detailed description in the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem arises when there are identical blocks with different locations. This indicates a need to review the sorting and comparison logic for the blocks.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to make changes to the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it correctly handles the identification and sorting of blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic in the `equals` function should be revised to accurately determine the equality of the BlockManagers.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes a modified `canonicalize` function, which now produces a canonical representation of the blocks based on their locations and values. Additionally, the sorting and comparison logic has been adjusted to properly determine the equality of the BlockManagers.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly determine the equality of the two BlockManagers, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
