The issue with the buggy function lies in the comparison of the blocks. The function is not properly comparing the blocks with different locations. This leads to the wrong result being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks in the function. We can use the `is` operator to check if the blocks are the same object. This way, we can properly compare the blocks regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code uses the `id` function to retrieve the unique identifier for each block, and it compares the blocks based on this identifier. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly, regardless of the block's location.

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected result based on the input/output variable information provided, and it should also fix the issue posted on the GitHub page.
