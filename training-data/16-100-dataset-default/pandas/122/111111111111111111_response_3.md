The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the sorting of blocks and the comparison logic. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances, checks if their axes are equal, then consolidates and compares their blocks. However, the comparison of the blocks is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function, particularly in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is called incorrectly within the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be reviewed and corrected. The comparison of blocks should compare the actual block values rather than sorting and comparing the list of blocks.

Additionally, the `canonicalize` function is defined twice, and the one defined within the `BlockManager` class seems to be incorrectly defined with a missing `self` parameter. This should be fixed by adding the `self` parameter to the `canonicalize` function.

Corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these changes, the `equals` method will now correctly compare the blocks' values rather than just the order of the blocks. This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to pass.

Additionally, the second definition of `canonicalize` within the class `BlockManager` should be removed, as it's not being used and could cause confusion.
