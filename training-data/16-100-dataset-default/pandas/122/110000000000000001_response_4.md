1. The buggy function is a method to check if two objects are equal. It compares the axes, consolidates the objects, compares the number of blocks, and then compares each block individually. The potential error location is likely within the block comparison part of the function.

2. The bug's cause is that it may fail to compare the blocks correctly due to unconsolidated blocks which cannot be distinguished by the iteration order.

3. The bug's cause is that unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical blocks, cannot be distinguished by the iteration order, leading to incorrect comparison results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Consolidating the blocks before comparison to ensure a consistent order
   - Utilizing a different method for comparing unconsolidated blocks
   - Checking for unconsolidated blocks and handling them separately or sorting them in a different way

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
