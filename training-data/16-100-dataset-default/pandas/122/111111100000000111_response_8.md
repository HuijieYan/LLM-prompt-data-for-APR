1. The buggy function is called "equals" and is part of the BlockManager class in the managers.py file of the pandas library. This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are of the same length and then proceeds to check the equality of individual blocks within the BlockManager objects. The issue reported on GitHub is that the equals function is returning True even when the block locations are different.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the blocks are being compared for equality. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations to canonicalize the block order before comparing them. However, this sorting based on location can cause identical blocks with different locations to be wrongly evaluated as unequal.

3. The bug's cause can be identified using the following:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" compares blocks within BlockManager objects for equality.
   (b). The BlockManager class contains the "equals" function and other related functions like "as_array", "canonicalize", and "_consolidate_inplace".
   (c). The "canonicalize" function is used to sort blocks based on type name and manager locations before comparison.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information reports that the "equals" function returns True even when the block locations are different.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the sorting criterion in the "canonicalize" function to prioritize the type name over manager locations to avoid incorrect comparisons due to different block locations.
   (b). Ensure that the comparison within the "equals" function considers all relevant factors for block equality without being affected by their locations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function "equals":

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the "canonicalize" function to prioritize the type name for sorting blocks, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly evaluated for equality. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
