The issue in the buggy function lies in the canonicalize block order logic. The function is not properly handling the block order comparison, causing it to return incorrect results.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function is not sorting the blocks correctly, which leads to the wrong comparison and ultimately the wrong return value.

The GitHub issue clearly states that the equals() method is returning True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize block order logic to properly handle the comparison of block orders. We can achieve this by modifying the canonicalize function to include the block's location information as well. This will ensure that unconsolidated blocks are handled correctly during comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize block order logic
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the buggy function should now handle block order comparison correctly and return the expected result as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
