Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The function compares the blocks based on their data type and location, but the sorting may not be consistent, leading to incorrect comparisons.

Bug cause:
The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks, leading to the wrong result. This is evident from the failing test, where `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class to ensure consistent sorting and comparison of the blocks.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

We have modified the `canonicalize` function to use the string representation of the block's data type and a byte representation of the block's locations. This ensures consistent sorting and comparison of the blocks.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
