The issue with the original equals function is that it is calling a function `equals` from the wrong class, causing unexpected behavior. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self.axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block._mgr_locs)
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The above code fixes the call to `equals` function as well as the usage of `mgr_locs` attribute and the generation of tuples in the `canonicalize` function. This should resolve the issue and the test should pass.
