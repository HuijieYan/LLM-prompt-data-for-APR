The buggy function is a part of the BlockManager class. The function compares the BlockManager instance with another BlockManager instance to check if they are equal. The potential error location in the function is the comparison of the blocks of the two BlockManager instances.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the blocks of the two BlockManager instances is not accurate. It does not account for unconsolidated blocks, which might result in an incorrect equality check.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to account for unconsolidated blocks, and use a different approach to compare the blocks of the two BlockManager instances.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._is_consolidated(), block.values.tostring()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block._is_consolidated(), block.values.tostring()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
