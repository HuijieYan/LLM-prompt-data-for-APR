The bug in the code seems to be related to the comparison of two dataframes using the `equals` method. The failing test is trying to compare two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and expects the comparison to return False. However, it is currently returning True, leading to the assertion error.

The issue lies in the implementation of the `equals` function. The comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` does not produce the expected result. It seems that the comparison logic is incorrect, and the function is not able to correctly determine whether two dataframes are equal or not.

To fix this bug, you can modify the comparison logic to compare the actual data within the blocks of the dataframes. This can be done by iterating over the blocks and comparing their values directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks directly
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now accurately compare the dataframes and return the expected results. This should resolve the failing test case and the assertion error.
