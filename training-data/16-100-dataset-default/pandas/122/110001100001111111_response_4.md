The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a canonicalization of the blocks. This sorting is causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered as not equal, leading to a false return value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the canonicalization and sorting of the blocks. Instead, we can directly compare the blocks in the same order without modifying their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct result for the provided test case, and it should also address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
