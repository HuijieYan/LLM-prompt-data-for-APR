Potential Error Location:
In the buggy function, the issue might be caused by the sorting of blocks using the 'canonicalize' function. This sorting could lead to incorrect comparison of dataframes and cause the buggy behavior.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function 'equals' compares two DataFrames and is supposed to return True if they have the same shape and elements. The issue arises when the function incorrectly returns True due to the sorting of blocks using the 'canonicalize' function.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the sorting technique used in the 'canonicalize' function to avoid sorting based on dtype.name and mgr_locs. Instead, use a simpler sorting approach.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks in the sorted lists is accurate, considering the elements and dtype.

Code Correction:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the fixed 'equals' function should now accurately compare the DataFrames and return the expected results. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
