The buggy function is a method named `equals` which seems to be a customized method for comparing two instances of a custom `BlockManager` class. The function first compares the axes of the two instances, and if they are equal, it proceeds to compare the blocks within the instances.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should be False. However, the test fails with the error message `assert True is False`.

Based on the input and output variable information provided, it seems that the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks may not be working as expected. This leads to an incorrect comparison of the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances, causing the function to return True when it should be False.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be updated to properly sort the blocks in a consistent way, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to sort blocks by type and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this change, the function will correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and return the expected result, thus passing the failing test.
