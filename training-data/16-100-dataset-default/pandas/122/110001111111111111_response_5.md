The issue in the buggy function is with the canonicalize function, which sorts the blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs. It seems to be using a tuple for sorting, but the tuples are not being created correctly. 

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to create tuples of (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs) for sorting, as well as the unnecessary duplicate function definitions should be removed. Additionally, the return statement should be replaced with correct logic for comparing the sorted blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
