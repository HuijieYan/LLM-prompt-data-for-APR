The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks. The failing test is trying to check if two different DataFrames are equal. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The bug in the function is likely in the comparison of the block contents. It seems that the comparison is not working as expected, resulting in an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to correctly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected version, the function iterates over each block in the `BlockManager` objects and compares them using the `equals` method of the block objects. This approach ensures that the comparison is done correctly and should fix the bug.
