1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The failing test is a test case for the `equals` method, which compares two instances of the `DataFrame` class, and it is expecting the result of `df1.equals(df2)` to be `False`. However, the actual result is `True`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method. The method sorts the blocks and then compares them using the `equals` method, but due to different block locations, the comparison fails.

3. The bug's cause is that the `equals` method does not properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This causes the method to incorrectly return `True` for instances that should be considered unequal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider the actual values of the blocks instead of just their positions.
   - Implement a method to normalize the blocks before comparison to ensure that identical blocks are compared correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # Normalize the blocks before comparison
    def normalize_blocks(blocks):
        normalized = []
        for block in blocks:
            normalized.append(block.values)
        return normalized
    
    self_blocks = normalize_blocks(self_blocks)
    other_blocks = normalize_blocks(other_blocks)
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the actual values of the blocks are compared for equality, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
