Potential Error Location: The bug is likely to be in the `canonicalize` function, which is not defined as a method and is missing the `self` parameter, resulting in it being called as if it were a method of the class.

Bug's Cause:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to compare and sort the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
2. The `canonicalize` function is defined outside the `BlockManager` class and is not a method, so it should not be called as `self.canonicalize`.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Define the `canonicalize` function as a method within the `BlockManager` class to correctly compare and sort the blocks.

Corrected code:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other functions)

    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

The corrected code defines the `canonicalize` function as a method within the `BlockManager` class and uses it as `self.canonicalize` while calling it. It also uses `other.canonicalize` as a method for `other_blocks`.
