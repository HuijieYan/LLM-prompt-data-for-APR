1. The buggy function is a method for comparing two objects. It checks that they have the same number of axes, and if so, it compares the axes and blocks of the two objects. However, there are a few potential issues in the function, such as the use of `self` and `other` without being part of a class, and potential issues with the `equals` method used in the comparison.

2. The potential error location is within the comparison of the axes and blocks, as well as sorting the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs.

3. The cause of the bug may be due to incorrect comparison of axes and blocks, or the sorting of blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly, and that the sorting of blocks does not cause issues with the comparison.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
In the corrected code, the comparison of axes and blocks is done correctly, and the sorting of blocks is also fixed to avoid potential issues with the comparison. Additionally, the use of `self` and `other` is assumed to be done within a class.
