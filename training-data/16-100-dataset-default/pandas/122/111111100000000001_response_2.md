The buggy function "equals" is within the class "BlockManager". This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects. The potential error in the code is when sorting the self_blocks and other_blocks using the "canonicalize" function. The "canonicalize" function is intended to create a canonical representation of a block, but it is not implemented correctly.

The bug occurs because the "canonicalize" function is defined twice in the class, once as a method and once as a standalone function. This causes confusion and may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the "canonicalize" function definition outside of the class should be removed, and the sorting logic should be modified to use the correct canonical representation of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    ...
    """
    
    # other methods...
    
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the standalone "canonicalize" function definition has been removed, and the sorting logic within the "equals" function now correctly utilizes the "canonicalize" method defined within the class. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the comparison between two BlockManager objects is performed correctly.
