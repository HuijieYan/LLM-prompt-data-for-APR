The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the comparison of `mgr_locs` using the `as_array.tolist()` method. This can lead to different locations for identical blocks, causing the comparison to return True incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be based on the actual `mgr_locs` values instead of converting them to a list. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly identified as unequal.

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # canonicalize block order using the type name and mgr_locs
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `equals` function will correctly identify the blocks as unequal in Case 1 and other similar cases, solving the issue reported on GitHub.
