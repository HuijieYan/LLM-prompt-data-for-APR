1. The buggy function "equals" is a method of the class "BlockManager" which is a core internal data structure used to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is called when comparing two instances of BlockManager using the "equals" method. The GitHub issue relates to the fact that the "equals" method wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error within the "equals" function is in the comparison of blocks between two instances. The sorting and comparison of blocks based on block type and locations may lead to incorrect evaluation in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

3. (a) The buggy function "equals" is attempting to compare the blocks of two BlockManager instances.
   (b) The BlockManager class is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc., and it manages labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.
   (c) The GitHub issue information states that the "equals" method wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison of blocks within the "equals" function. We can compare the blocks directly by checking if the number of blocks, their types, and locations match between the two instances.

5. Here's the corrected version of the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        self_block = self.blocks[i]
        other_block = other.blocks[i]
        
        if self_block.dtype != other_block.dtype:
            return False
        
        if not np.array_equal(self_block.mgr_locs.as_array, other_block.mgr_locs.as_array):
            return False
    
    return True
```

In this corrected version, we first consolidate the blocks in both instances using the "_consolidate_inplace" method. Then, we compare the number of blocks and iterate through each block to check if their data types and locations match. If any mismatch is found, we immediately return False. If all blocks match, we return True at the end.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
