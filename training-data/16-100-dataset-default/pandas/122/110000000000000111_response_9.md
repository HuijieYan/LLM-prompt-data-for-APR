1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of a DataFrame class (assuming it is pandas) that is meant to compare two DataFrames for equality. The GitHub issue is reporting that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of blocks. When comparing blocks, the function canonicalizes them based on the block's dtype name and manager locations. This may lead to false positives in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results in the `equals` method. This is evident from the GitHub issue where a simple test case failed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adjust the comparison logic to account for blocks with different locations but are otherwise identical.
   - Modify the canonicalization process to ensure that blocks with identical content are identified as equal, regardless of their location.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # instead of canonicalizing blocks based on dtype name and manager locations,
    # compare blocks directly for equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function directly compares the blocks for equality without canonicalizing them based on their dtype name and manager locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where the `equals` method wrongly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
