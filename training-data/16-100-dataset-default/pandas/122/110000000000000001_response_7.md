1. This buggy function is a method that checks whether two pandas DataFrame objects are equal. It checks if the axes, blocks, and data within the blocks are equal between the two DataFrames.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the sorting of the blocks using the "canonicalize" function. The sorting may not correctly handle all cases of different block orders.

3. The bug's cause is that the sorting of blocks using the "canonicalize" function may not correctly order the blocks in all cases, leading to false negatives when comparing DataFrames for equality.

4. To fix the bug, we can use a more comprehensive method for comparing the blocks and their data within the DataFrames, without solely relying on sorting.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks and their data
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```
