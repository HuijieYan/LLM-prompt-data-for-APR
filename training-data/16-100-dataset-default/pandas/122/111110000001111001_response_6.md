The issue with the buggy function is that the `canonicalize` function is defined within the function but is intended to be an instance method of the class. This causes an error when calling `mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function, as it is not properly bound to an instance of the class.

To fix this, the `canonicalize` function should be defined as an instance method within the class. Additionally, the `block` and `other_block` attributes should be accessed using the `self` and `other` instances, respectively.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # define canonicalize as an instance method
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
