Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is that the function is comparing the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" using the "equals" method, which might not be implemented correctly in the related functions. 

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function attempts to compare the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" using the "equals" method. If the "equals" method is not implemented correctly in the related functions, it will lead to inaccurate comparison results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the "equals" method is implemented correctly in the related functions.
2. Instead of relying on the "equals" method, consider using a different approach to compare the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" to ensure accurate results.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks directly instead of using the "equals" method
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```
