The problem seems to be with the sorting of the blocks in the `equals` function. It seems that when comparing the blocks, the function is not considering the actual values of the blocks, causing the comparison to fail even when the content of the blocks is the same.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the values of the blocks, not just their types and positions. This can be done by including the actual block values in the tuple used for sorting.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
