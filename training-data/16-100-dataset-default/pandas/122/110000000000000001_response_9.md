1. The buggy function is a comparison method that is supposed to check if two objects are equal by comparing their attributes. It appears to be part of a class, as it uses `self` and `other` as parameters.

2. The potential error lies in the comparison of the blocks of the two objects. It does not take into account the possibility that the blocks might have different order or are not consolidated.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly compare the blocks of the two objects, leading to potential incorrect equality checks.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   - Ensure that both objects have their blocks consolidated before performing the comparison.
   - Compare the blocks using a method appropriate for the type of objects being compared.

5. Here is the corrected code with the identified bug fixed:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare the blocks
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code:
- Both objects have their blocks consolidated before the comparison.
- The blocks are compared iteratively using a for loop to ensure proper comparison.
- The function will return True if all checks pass, indicating that the objects are equal.
