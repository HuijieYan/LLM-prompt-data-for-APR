Potential error location: The issue lies in the comparison of the locations of the blocks within the `equals` function. It seems that the comparison is not properly handling the case where the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.

Bug cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the comparison of block locations within the `equals` function. When comparing the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the comparison does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of directly comparing the block locations, compare the actual content of the blocks to determine equality.
2. Some form of normalization or comparison that can account for different block locations but same block content should be implemented.

To address the bug and the GitHub issue, a corrected version of the function could be implemented as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version attempts to address the issue by sorting the blocks based on their locations and then comparing the sorted blocks for equality, which should handle cases where the blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
