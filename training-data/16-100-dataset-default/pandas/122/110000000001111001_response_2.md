The issue with the buggy function is that it is not comparing the block dtype and mgr_locs for equality, which might lead to false negatives even when the data is the same. This is evident from the fact that block.dtype and block.mgr_locs are not being used in the return condition.

To fix this issue, we need to compare the block dtype and mgr_locs for equality in addition to comparing the blocks. We can do this by modifying the canonicalize function to include block dtype and mgr_locs as part of the tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the block dtype and mgr_locs for equality in addition to comparing the blocks, thereby fixing the bug and satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
