The buggy function is a method in the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It does this by comparing the axes, consolidating in place, sorting and comparing the blocks within them.

The potential error in the function is with the comparison of the axes and blocks. There is a chance that the comparison is not done correctly, leading to incorrect equality results.

The bug's cause could be due to the incorrect comparison of the axes and blocks. Additionally, there might be a problem with the sorting of the blocks and the use of the `equals` method for comparison.

To fix the bug, the function should first ensure that both `self` and `other` objects are BlockManager instances. Then, it should compare the axes and blocks more accurately, and use the appropriate method for comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False

    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check to ensure that `other` is an instance of `BlockManager`. Then we've made modifications to the comparison of axes and blocks, and used the `type(block).__name__` to get the type name for comparison. Additionally, we are using the `equals` method for comparing the blocks.
