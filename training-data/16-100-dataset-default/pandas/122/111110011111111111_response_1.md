The issue lies in the equals() function of the BlockManager class. The function is meant to compare two instances of BlockManager for equality, but it fails to do so due to a bug in sorting the block elements before comparison.

The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" creates two dataframes (df1 and df2) with identical blocks but in different order. The test expects df1.equals(df2) to return False, but it fails due to the bug in the equals() function.

The bug within the equals() function occurs when it compares the blocks of two BlockManager instances. The function incorrectly sorts the blocks before comparison, leading to wrong results when comparing identical blocks with different ordering.

To fix this bug, the equals() function should directly compare the blocks without modifying their order. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate and the expected result is returned for the failing test.

Here is the corrected code for the equals() function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the equals() function will directly compare the blocks and return the expected result, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
