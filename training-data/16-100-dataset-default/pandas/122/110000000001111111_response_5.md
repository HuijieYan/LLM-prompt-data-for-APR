The problem with the provided function seems to be that it is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two BlockManager objects. This leads to the function returning True in cases where the blocks are identical but have different locations, which is incorrect.

The issue in the function lies in the comparison of block locations. The function does not handle the case where identical blocks are located at different positions within the BlockManager objects.

The expected input/output variable information indicates that the function should correctly compare the block locations and return False if the blocks are at different locations.

The GitHub issue further confirms this issue, as the user expects the equals() function to return False when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the actual content of the blocks, rather than only their locations. This can be achieved by iterating through the blocks and comparing their contents.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes = self.axes
    other_axes = other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version of the function iterates through the axes and blocks of the two BlockManager objects, comparing their contents to ensure that identical blocks at different locations are correctly identified as unequal. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
