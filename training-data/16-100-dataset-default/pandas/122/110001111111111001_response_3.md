The issue in the `equals` function lies in the comparison of the block order. The function tries to sort the blocks based on their type and the location, but the comparison of `block.equals(oblock)` is likely to fail due to the different order of the blocks.

To fix this issue, the comparison needs to be performed in a way that doesn't rely on the order of the blocks. One way to approach this is to use a set to compare the blocks instead of relying on the specific order.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a set to compare the blocks
    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return {b.values for b in blocks}

    self_block_set = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_block_set = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    return self_block_set == other_block_set
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function now compares the sets of blocks from `self` and `other`. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
