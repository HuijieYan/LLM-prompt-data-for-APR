The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The function is used to compare two dataframes and check if they are equal. However, the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False` in cases where the dataframes have identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting could lead to identical blocks being compared in different order if they have different locations, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True`.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` checks if the `equals` function returns `False` for two dataframes `df1` and `df2` which have identical blocks but different locations. The error message indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`.

The GitHub issue provides additional context and states that the issue is related to the `equals` function incorrectly returning `True` in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to be modified to consider the block's values in addition to `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not sorted in a way that would cause the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to consider block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now correctly return `False` for cases where identical blocks with different locations are compared, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
