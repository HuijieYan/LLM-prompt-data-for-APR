The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The issue seems to be that it mistakenly returns True when comparing two DataFrame objects that contain identical blocks with different locations.

The problem occurs when the function checks if the blocks are equal. It first sorts the blocks and then compares them. However, when sorting the blocks, it uses a `canonicalize` function that is defined outside the class, resulting in a different order than the blocks' original order.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to be a method within the class. This will ensure that the comparison of blocks preserves their original order. We will also need to update the function to use the correct method for retrieving the locations of the blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    ...
    """

    # other class methods here ...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # define a new canonicalize method within the class
        def canonicalize_block(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison of blocks will use their original order, which should resolve the issue. This will also ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes and the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is addressed.

This should also resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and the failing test, ensuring that the `equals` method behaves as expected.
