1. The buggy function is intended to compare two instances of a class. However, the function contains several issues that result in incorrect comparison between the two instances. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` uses this function to compare two dataframes and expects the comparison to return `False`, but it instead returns `True` and hence the assertion fails.

2. The potential error in the problematic function seems to be in the `equals` method, where it attempts to compare two instances by comparing their attributes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed and does not produce the expected result.

3. The error is caused by the flawed comparison logic within the `equals` method. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because the comparison result is `True` instead of `False`. This indicates that the comparison method is not working as intended.

4. To fix the bug, we need to revisit the comparison logic within the `equals` method and make sure that it correctly compares the attributes and blocks of the two instances. Additionally, we need to handle the comparison of dataframe contents in a way that satisfies the failing test.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare contents of dataframes
    for self_col, other_col in zip(self.columns, other.columns):
        if not self[self_col].equals(other[other_col]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected code for the `equals` method, the comparison logic has been updated to compare the axes and blocks of the instances, as well as the contents of the dataframes, which should now satisfy the failing test.
