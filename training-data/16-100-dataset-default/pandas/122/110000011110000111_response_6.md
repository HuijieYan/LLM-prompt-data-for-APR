Upon analyzing the provided information, the buggy function appears to be the `equals` method for 'DataFrame' objects in the pandas library. The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values in the same columns and then checks if `df1.equals(df2)` returns False. However, the actual output is `True`.

The error message from the failing test clearly indicates that the equality check is returning True when it should be False. This behavior is not as expected.

The GitHub issue title and the detailed description also confirm that the `equals` method is wrongly returning True in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the `equals` method seems to be in the block of code where it is comparing the DataFrame blocks using the `canonicalize` function and the `zip` function. There might be an issue with how the blocks are being compared based on their type name and locations.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to ensure that it correctly identifies the differences if any. This might involve revisiting the logic of the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison of blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks.to_list()
    other_blocks = other.blocks.to_list()
    if self_blocks != other_blocks:
        return False

    return True
```

The corrected method simplifies the comparison of DataFrame axes and blocks. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, it directly compares the blocks as lists. The logic for axis comparison remains the same.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
