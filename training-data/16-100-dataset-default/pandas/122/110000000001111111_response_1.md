The buggy function is a method called equals, which is a part of the DataFrame class in Pandas. The function is intended to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal, False otherwise. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function is returning True even when the DataFrames have identical blocks but with different locations.

Based on the input and output variable information provided, it seems that the bug occurs when comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, and then compares them. However, it does not consider the actual values of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparisons.

The bug seems to arise from the comparison of the blocks within the DataFrames. The function erroneously returns True when comparing the sorted blocks of two DataFrames, even when their values are different.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the values of the blocks in addition to their type name and manager locations. By modifying the comparison process to include the actual block values, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies differences between the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(block, block.values) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(block, block.values) for block in other.blocks]

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block[0].dtype.name, block[1], block[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block[0].equals(oblock[0]) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we create a list of tuples for each block, where the first element is the block itself, and the second element is the block's values. Then, we modify the canonicalize function to consider both the type name and values of the block. The comparison process is then updated to correctly compare the block values in addition to their type and manager locations.

With these modifications, the equals method should now correctly identify differences between two DataFrames, as per the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
