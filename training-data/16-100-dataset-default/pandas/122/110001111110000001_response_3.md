The buggy function `equals` is a method of the DataFrame class in pandas, and it is used to compare two DataFrames for equality. 

From the error message, we can see that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing. The error message shows that `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is returning True when it should return False, meaning that it is incorrectly identifying the two DataFrames as equal.

The issue in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. This function sorts the blocks of the DataFrame based on their type name and manager locations. This sorting method is causing the bug, as it is incorrectly identifying the two DataFrames as equal.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to use a different method for sorting the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the two DataFrames and pass the failing test.
