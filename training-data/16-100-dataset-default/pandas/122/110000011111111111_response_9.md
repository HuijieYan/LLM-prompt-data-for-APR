The potential error location within the problematic function is the canonicalization of block order using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs. This can lead to issues when the blocks have different locations.

The bug's cause is that the equals function does not return the correct result when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the canonicalize function to take into account the block's data values as well as their type, and directly comparing the block data values to check for equality.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this correction, the equals function will directly compare the blocks of the two DataFrames for equality, taking into account both their data values and their types. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct result when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
