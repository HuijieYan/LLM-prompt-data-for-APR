The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two BlockManager objects and returns True if they are equal and False if they are not. 

The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking the equality of two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method, and expecting it to return False. However, the function returns True instead, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code that compares the blocks of the two BlockManager objects. The comparison of blocks is done in a way that results in True even when the blocks are not at the same locations.

The bug's cause is that the function does not consider the location of the blocks when comparing them, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the function should consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block's position information as well, so that blocks with the same values but different positions are not considered equal.

Below is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now consider the location of the blocks when comparing them, and will return the correct result, fixing the bug and addressing the failing test.
