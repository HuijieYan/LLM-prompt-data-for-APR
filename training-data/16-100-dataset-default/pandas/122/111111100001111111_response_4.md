The issue with the buggy function `equals` seems to be related to the comparison of blocks. It appears that the comparison does not take into account the location of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

One potential error location within the function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the sorting does not consider the block locations, which might result in a mismatch when comparing the blocks.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function `equals` is comparing blocks in a way that does not consider their locations, leading to incorrect results.
(b). The `BlockManager` class seems to store the block locations, but the comparison does not take this into account.
(c). The `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider block locations.
(d). The expected and actual input/output variable values show that the comparison is incorrect due to the blocks not being properly sorted by their locations.
(e). The GitHub issue information also confirms that the `equals` function is returning incorrect results when comparing blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should take into account the block locations when sorting the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function should consider their locations to ensure accurate results.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by type name and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By considering the block locations in the sorting process and the comparison, the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
