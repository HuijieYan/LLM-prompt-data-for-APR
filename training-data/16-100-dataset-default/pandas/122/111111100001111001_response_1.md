The issue with the buggy function is that it is defining the 'canonicalize' function twice, once outside the class and once inside the class. This is causing the 'block' variable inside the 'canonicalize' function to refer to the function instead of the input parameter.

To fix this, we need to remove the 'canonicalize' function that is defined outside the class and use the 'canonicalize' function defined inside the class.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    (...)
    """


    # this is the buggy function that has been corrected
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Use the 'canonicalize' function defined inside the class
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this correction, the 'canonicalize' function defined inside the class will correctly refer to the input parameter, and the function should now return the expected output based on the provided test cases.
