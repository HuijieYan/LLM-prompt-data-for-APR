The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the date_range method, and potentially other issues. The main concern seems to be around timezones and ambiguity that is being raised when the code reaches this point - `date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")`. It might be better to adjust the time indices to be more timezone-aware.


Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function considering potential timezone issues:

```python
# Corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.tz_localize('UTC').min(), ax.tz_localize('UTC').max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function takes the original time index `ax` and preprocesses it to ensure it is localized in UTC for consistency. Then, it calculates the date range considering timezones and potential ambiguity. This should help to prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was raised before.

It should be noted that in a real-world situation, it would be important to review and test these changes thoroughly as they have the potential to impact other functionality. Also, the corrections provided are specific to the issue described and might not cover all potential problems in the original code.
