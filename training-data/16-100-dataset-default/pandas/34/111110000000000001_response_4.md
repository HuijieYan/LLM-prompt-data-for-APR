The buggy function is _get_time_bins, which is part of the TimeGrouper class. The function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input axis (ax) and some other parameters. The potential error location within the function is at the line `ax_values = ax.asi8` where it attempts to access the asi8 attribute of the ax parameter without checking if it exists or if ax is not null.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the ax parameter is always valid and has the asi8 attribute, which may not always be the case. This can lead to AttributeError or TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the ax parameter is valid and has the asi8 attribute before attempting to access it. Additionally, a check for the length of ax should be added before performing any calculations to ensure it has valid data.

The corrected code for the _get_time_bins function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        ax_values = getattr(ax, 'asi8', None)
        if ax_values is None:
            # Handle the case when asi8 attribute is not available
            raise AttributeError("asi8 attribute not found in the axis")
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for the existence of the asi8 attribute using getattr, and if it is not found, an AttributeError is raised. This ensures that the function handles cases where the attribute is not available in the input axis.
