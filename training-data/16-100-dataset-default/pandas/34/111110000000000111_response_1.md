1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class and the GitHub issue:
The buggy function is called `_get_time_bins` and it is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with the `pd.Grouper` for daily frequency on clock change day in Cuba, causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the `_get_time_bins` function could be related to the calculation of labels and bins for time intervals, especially when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.

3. Elucidating the bug's cause using the provided information:
(a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins and labels for grouping time-series data.
(b). The `TimeGrouper` class is used for custom time-interval grouping.
(c). The GitHub issue describes how the current implementation of `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba.

4. Suggesting possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the handling of ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function, possibly by incorporating logic to properly account for ambiguous time transitions.

5. Presenting the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code attempts to address the bug related to handling ambiguous timestamps by incorporating additional logic for handling time transitions. However, further testing and validation may be required to ensure that the bug is completely resolved.
