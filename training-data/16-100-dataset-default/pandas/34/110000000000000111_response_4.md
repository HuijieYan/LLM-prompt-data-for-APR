1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue as it is a part of the code that is causing the AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency, particularly on clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of ambiguous timestamps and the generation of bins and labels.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the function's inability to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resulting in errors when creating bins and labels for grouping the data. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem, specifically mentioning the issue with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba. This aligns with the ambiguity handling in the function, which is resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include updating the function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, ensuring that bins and labels are generated without causing errors related to ambiguous time.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels 
```

The corrected code addresses the handling of ambiguous timestamps and the generation of bins and labels, resolving the issues described in the GitHub problem. This revised implementation aims to handle ambiguous timestamps and generate bins and labels without causing AmbiguousTimeError.
