The bug in the code is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba. The failing test is triggered by the `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")` method, which is used to group the data by 1 day. The error received is an "AmbiguousTimeError", indicating that the timestamp is ambiguous due to the clock change.

The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly. This results in the error when trying to group the data by 1 day.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle the ambiguous timestamp and create the time bins with the correct labels.

Based on the provided information and the failing test case, the potential error location within the problematic function is the construction of the `binner` and `labels` variables before checking for ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times correctly. We need to ensure that the labels for the time bins are created in a way that doesn't result in ambiguous timestamps. This may involve adjusting the time range or using appropriate methods to handle ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the above change, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps correctly and generate the time bins and labels without triggering the "AmbiguousTimeError" in the failing test.
