1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is being called within the context of the GitHub issue posted. The issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a clock-change day in Cuba. The function is a part of the code that is failing to handle this situation, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of timestamps and binning of time intervals. This is evident from the GitHub issue's description of the problem with handling ambiguous timestamps, especially on the day of a clock change.

3. The bug's cause is related to the inability of the function `_get_time_bins` to handle ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a clock-change day in Cuba. This results in the `pd.Grouper` function failing to handle the situation as expected, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. The problematic function fails to appropriately adjust the labels and bins for the time intervals, especially on a day when the local time is ambiguous due to a clock change.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Implementing a mechanism to identify and handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on days when a clock change occurs.
   - Adjusting the binning and labeling of time intervals to account for ambiguous local times.

5.  Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code attempts to handle ambiguous timestamps by using the 'infer' argument for the `ambiguous` parameter when creating the date range. It also adjusts the labels and bins based on the specified frequency and closed/open intervals. This should help resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue, as observed in the GitHub problem description.
