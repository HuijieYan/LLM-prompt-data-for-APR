The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` which is part of the `pandas.core.resample` module. The function is called by the `groupby` operation on a DataFrame with a `DatetimeIndex` which is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of time bins and labels, which is leading to the ambiguous time error.

The bug's cause is due to the handling of time bin generation when there are ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a clock change day in Cuba.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the time bins and labels are generated in a way that handles ambiguous times, such as by using the `infer` option for ambiguous times. This can help ensure that the time bins and labels are accurately representing the data without causing ambiguous time errors.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Generate time bins and labels with handling for ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle ambiguous times when generating time bins and labels, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
