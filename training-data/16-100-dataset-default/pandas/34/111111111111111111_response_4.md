The issue is caused by the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The bug leads to a wrong result due to the `AmbiguousTimeError` error, causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps occurring on the clock change day in Cuba, specifically at midnight local time. This is due to an incorrect use of the `date_range` function and the way binning is handled, resulting in the error and wrong output.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class needs to be updated to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and binning, ensuring that the desired result is achieved without errors.

One possible approach to fix the bug would be to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to use the `Index.shift` method to handle the ambiguous time issue and correctly adjust the bins. This can be done by explicitly checking for ambiguous timestamps and adjusting the bins accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    bin_edges = binner.shift(1, freq=-self.freq).union([binner[-1]])
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges.asi8, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the `_get_time_bins` function should work correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
