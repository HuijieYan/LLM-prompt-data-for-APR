1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of a class that deals with resampling time series data. It is used to compute time bins for grouping purposes. The GitHub issue is related to using the `groupby` function with a daily frequency, which fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba. The issue is related to how the time bins are being computed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the computation of the time bins using the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function. It seems that the function may not be handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` attempts to compute time bins for grouping time series data, which involves using various helpers like `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64`.
   (b). The related functions like `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are also involved in computing the time bins and adjusting them based on the input time series data.
   (c). The GitHub issue describes how the call to `groupby` on a clock-change day in Cuba raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This suggests that the computation of time bins is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - There may be a need to handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly, possibly by using the `is_dst` parameter in date range creation and considering localized time for bin edge adjustment.
   - Consider using the knowledge about the specific timezone (e.g., 'America/Havana') to adjust the bins and labels accordingly, especially around the time of the clock change.
   - Ensure that the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` function correctly handles cases where timestamps are ambiguous due to timezone changes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range
import pandas.core.resample

# Corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Explicitly handle ambiguous times using localized time
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        is_dst=True  # Consider daylight saving time
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    # Adjust bins and labels based on the timezone
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps in generate_bins_dt64
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans,
        ambiguous="infer"
    )

    # Further adjustments based on closed and label parameters
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```
The corrected code includes explicit handling of ambiguous times, consideration of daylight saving time, and adjustments based on the timezone, in order to address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
