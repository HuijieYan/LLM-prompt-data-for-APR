Potential error location:
The bug is likely to be located in the calculation of the bin_edges variable, as it is used to generate the bins and labels, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function _get_time_bins is responsible for creating the bins and labels for grouping the data.
(b). The TimeGrouper class represents a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, and the _get_time_bins is a method in this class responsible for creating the bins and labels for grouping the TimeGrouper data.
(c). The related functions _adjust_bin_edges and _get_timestamp_range_edges are called within the _get_time_bins method to calculate the bin_edges and timestamps based on the input parameters.
(d). The discrepancy lies in the generation of bin_edges, which is not accounting for the ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba.
(e). The GitHub issue also describes a similar nature of the problem where the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock-change day in Cuba. The expected output is to have three groups for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November, with the group for the 4th of November correctly labeled and containing the hourly data points for that day.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, especially in regions such as Cuba, when calculating the bin_edges.
2. Ensure that the generated bins and labels accurately represent the time intervals without causing AmbiguousTimeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = np.concatenate([ax_values, [ax_values[-1] + self.freq.value]])
    bin_edges = bin_edges - (bin_edges % self.freq.value)  # Adjust bin_edges for ambiguous timestamps

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code will handle the generation of bin_edges to account for the ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, preventing the AmbiguousTimeError as described in the GitHub issue.
