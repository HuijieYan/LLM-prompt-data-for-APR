1. The buggy function is a part of a wider codebase that seems to be working with time series data and generating time bins for the data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where the `ax_values` and `bin_edges` are being used to generate `bins`. There could be a discrepancy in the length of `ax_values` and `bin_edges` leading to an error.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the discrepancy in the length of `ax_values` and `bin_edges` resulting in an error when trying to generate the bins.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve ensuring that the length of `ax_values` and `bin_edges` matches before using them to generate the bins. Additionally, checking for any other potential discrepancies in the code that could lead to errors in generating the time bins would be beneficial.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd


def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = self._get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- `pd` has been imported to ensure the correct usage of pandas functions and data types.
- The method `_get_timestamp_range_edges` has been replaced with `self._get_timestamp_range_edges` assuming it's a method within the same class.
- `pd.NaT` has been used instead of `NaT` to ensure correct usage of the `NaT` value.
