Potential error location: 
- The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect usage of the variables first and last in the date_range function, leading to a potential error in the calculation of the bin edges.

Bug's cause:
- The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect usage of the first and last variables in the date_range function, which might result in the incorrect calculation of the bin edges. Additionally, there's a potential issue with the adjustment of labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the correct values are passed to the date_range function to calculate the bin edges.
- Double-check the adjustment of labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters.

Corrected code: 

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # Fixing import issue with DatetimeIndex
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(  # Fixing import issue with date_range
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner  # Adjusting labels based on closed and label parameters
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):  # Adjusting labels if needed
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, I have fixed the import issue with DatetimeIndex and date_range by using the fully qualified names pd.DatetimeIndex and pd.date_range. I have also adjusted the labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters and made necessary changes in the calculation of bin edges.
