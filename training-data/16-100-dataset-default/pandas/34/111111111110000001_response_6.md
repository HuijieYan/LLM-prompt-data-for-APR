The buggy function is a method called `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This method is being called as part of the process of performing a groupby operation on a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex using the `pd.Grouper` class.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is attempting to test the behavior of downsampling a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex containing ambiguous time entries due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. This DST transition results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` while executing the `groupby` operation.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` method is in the creation of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. The `ambiguous` argument of the `date_range` call is set to "infer" which causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` during DST transition.

To fix the bug, the `ambiguous` argument of the `date_range` function needs to be set explicitly to `True` in order to handle ambiguous times during DST transition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (existing code)

    # use explicit ambiguous=True to handle DST transition
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=True,  # Set explicit ambiguous argument to handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # ... (existing code)
```

By setting the `ambiguous` argument to `True`, the corrected code handles ambiguous times during the DST transition and should pass the failing test.
