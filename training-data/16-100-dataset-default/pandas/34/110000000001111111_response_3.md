The issue here is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in Cuba, which causes an AmbiguousTimeError. The bug occurs when calling the groupby function, and it is related to how the time bins are being generated in the _get_time_bins method.

The bug likely occurs when the function attempts to generate the bins for the given frequency, and it does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _get_time_bins function to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This may involve adjusting the logic for generating bins and labels in the presence of ambiguous timestamps.

The corrected code for the problematic function should handle ambiguous timestamps and generate the time bins and labels correctly.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor("D")
    last = ax[-1].ceil("D")

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we use the first and last timestamps from the input axis to generate the binner and labels, ensuring that they correctly handle ambiguous timestamps. We also adjust the logic for handling labels in the presence of NaNs. This update should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report and handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in Cuba.
