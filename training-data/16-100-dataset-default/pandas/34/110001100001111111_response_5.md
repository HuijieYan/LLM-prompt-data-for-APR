The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the handling of the timestamp range on a clock change day in Cuba. The bug may be causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, and the subsequent generation of `binner` and `labels`.

The cause of the bug may be that the timestamp range edges are not correctly handled, especially on the day of the clock change in Cuba, leading to incorrect binning and labeling.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to ensure that the timestamp range edges are properly adjusted to handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day. This may require checking for ambiguous times and adjusting the binning and labeling accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, NaT
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import Day
from pandas import date_range
from pandas import lib
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ts = ax.min().tz_convert(self.freq.tz)
    ts_rounded = ts.ceil(self.freq)
    ts_diff = (ts_rounded - ts) / to_offset('1H')

    bins = np.arange(0, len(ax) + ts_diff, ts_diff, dtype=np.int)
    labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ts_rounded,
        periods=len(bins),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, 0)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba and correctly generate the bins and labels for grouping the data. It should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
