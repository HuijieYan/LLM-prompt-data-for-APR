The bug is likely caused by a discrepancy between the time zones in the test data and the internal representation of time zones within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class.

The `_get_time_bins` function generates labels for the time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`. It then attempts to apply time zone information to these labels. However, due to the way that time zones are handled, an ambiguous time error is raised due to the discrepancy between the specified time zone and the internal representation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the time zone information is handled consistently and appropriately within the `_get_time_bins` function.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle time zone information explicitly and consistently throughout. This includes ensuring that the time zone is correctly associated with the `binner` and `labels` generated in the function.

Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the labels are causing an ambiguous time error due to the inconsistent handling of time zone information in the `_get_time_bins` function. Ensuring that the time zone information is correctly applied to the labels should resolve this issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure time zone information is propagated
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the time zone information is consistently applied to the `binner` and `labels` by passing the `tz` parameter when creating these objects. This should address the ambiguous time error that was observed in the failing test.
