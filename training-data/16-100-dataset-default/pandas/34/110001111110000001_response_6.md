The error is occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to infer daylight saving time (dst) from a specific time. This suggests that the `date_range` function is not handling ambiguous times properly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous times correctly by using the `ambiguous` parameter when calling the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by setting them to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the `ambiguous` parameter to "NaT" when calling the `date_range` function, ambiguous times will be handled by being replaced with NaT (Not a Time), which should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
