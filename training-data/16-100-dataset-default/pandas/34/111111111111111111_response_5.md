The bug is likely located within the `_adjust_bin_edges` function or the `_get_time_bins` function. The failing test is encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError` which means that the code is not handling the ambiguous timestamps that arise due to the clock change in Cuba on November 4th, 2018.

It seems like the problematic code is not handling the Daylight Saving Time (DST) changes properly. The code is generating bins for each day, but it's failing to account for the fact that on the day of the clock change, there are ambiguous times due to the extra hour. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To address this bug, the code needs to handle the ambiguous times during the clock change.

The updated code for the `_get_time_bins` function is shown below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        binner = labels = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='infer')
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated code includes the `ambiguous='infer'` parameter when creating the bins. This parameter allows the code to detect and handle ambiguous times during the clock change, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The corrected code should now address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
