The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in the context of resampling time bins for a Pandas DataFrame. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` tries to downsample a DataFrame by grouping it by a frequency of 1 day. However, when the test is run, it raises a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` which suggests that there is a problem with time zone conversion or handling of ambiguous time.

Looking at the `_get_time_bins` implementation and the error message, it seems that there might be an issue with time zone handling during the resampling process. The error message specifically mentions an ambiguous time error, which is related to time zone conversions.

To fix the bug, it's worth checking the time zone handling code within the `_get_time_bins` function. Additionally, the time zone localization and conversion functions used in the test code should also be reviewed to ensure that the time zone information is handled correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle ambiguous times by providing a strategy for handling ambiguous or non-existent times during time zone conversions within the `_get_time_bins` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the time zone handling for ambiguous and non-existent times during time zone conversion has been explicitly set using the `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` parameters when creating the `date_range`. This way, the function provides a valid strategy for handling ambiguous times, which should address the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` that was raised during the failing test.
