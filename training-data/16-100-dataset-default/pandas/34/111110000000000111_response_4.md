1. The function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper` which indicates it is intended to calculate time bins for grouping time series data.

2. The potential error location within the function `_get_time_bins` is likely to be within the calculation of time bins using the `date_range` function, specifically when handling ambiguous time instances.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to encounter issues when handling AmbiguousTimeError due to ambiguous timestamps, particularly on days with clock changes.
   (b). The buggy class `TimeGrouper` is intended to provide custom groupby functionality for time-interval grouping using pandas.
   (c). The GitHub Issue information indicates that the call to groupby fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba, specifically on long clock-change days.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include improving the handling of ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the time bins calculation takes into account the potential for ambiguous time instances, and addressing how the time bins are labeled and created.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous="NaT")
    start = binner[0]
    end = binner[-1] + self.freq
    labels = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the handling of ambiguous timestamps is improved by utilizing the `floor` method to handle ambiguous times as 'NaT' (Not a Time). Additionally, the start and end points for creating time bins are adjusted to ensure proper handling of ambiguous time instances.
