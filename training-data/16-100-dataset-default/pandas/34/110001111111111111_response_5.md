The issue here is that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, e.g. 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp due to daylight savings time. This causes an AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency on a DataFrame.

The problem arises due to the incorrect handling of timezones and the start and end times for the grouped time bins.

To fix the bug, the code needs to ensure that the start and end times for the time bins are handled correctly, including accounting for daylight savings time changes. Additionally, the labels for the time bins also need to be adjusted to accurately represent the time points.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()  # Normalize start time to account for local time changes
    last = ax[-1] + Timedelta(self.freq.value - 1, unit=self.freq.unit)  # Adjust end time based on frequency

    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, closed=self.closed)  # Use date_range to handle time bins
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the issue should be resolved. It handles the start and end times for the time bins more accurately and adjusts the labels accordingly, taking into account daylight savings time changes.

This should successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, and the failing test should now pass without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
