The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The failing test is related to the `groupby` operation using a `Grouper` with a frequency of "1D".

The potential error location is likely in the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` method. This is based on the error message which mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer daylight saving time from a specific date and time.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function is not handling the ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is triggered by the attempt to infer the daylight saving time from a specific time that has no repeated times, causing ambiguity.

To fix the bug, one approach is to use the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times appropriately by setting it to "NaT". This will ensure that any ambiguous times are represented as "Not a Time" and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous times to NaT
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function is set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times appropriately. This should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring and pass the failing test.
