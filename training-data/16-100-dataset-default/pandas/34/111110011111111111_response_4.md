### Bug Location
The bug is likely located within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. This function is responsible for creating bins for time intervals, but it seems to mishandle timezone transitions, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing a groupby operation.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug appears to be the mishandling of timezone transitions within the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically around ambiguous time periods due to daylight saving time changes. This causes the groupby operation to raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` when it encounters ambiguous timestamps.

The failing test attempts to use the `groupby` operation with a daily frequency on a DateTimeIndex that includes a transition for daylight saving time (DST) in Cuba, resulting in an ambiguous time error.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Incorporating proper handling of transitions due to daylight saving time changes in the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Ensuring that the bins and labels are generated taking into account the timezone and handling ambiguous time periods properly.
3. Validating the intervals during time binning to avoid ambiguous time errors in the groupby operation.
4. Refactoring the logic to explicitly handle ambiguous time periods and ensure the correct generation of bins and labels.

### Corrected Code
```python
# Import required libraries
from pandas import DateOffset, Timestamp, NaT, DatetimeIndex, Series

# The corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().floor('D')  # Adjust to start of day
    last = ax.max().ceil('D')  # Adjust to end of day

    binner = date_range(
        start=first - DateOffset(nanoseconds=1),  # Adjust for DST transition
        end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )
    bin_edges = Series(binner).astype('int64').values

    # Handle ambiguous times and transitions due to timezones
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins taking into account the timezone and ambiguous times
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed and label parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Handle missing, ambiguous, or additional labels
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the handling of timezone transitions and ambiguous times is improved to ensure that the bins and labels are generated correctly. This should resolve the issue with the failing test and the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered during the groupby operation.
