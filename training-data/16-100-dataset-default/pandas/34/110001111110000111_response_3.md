1. Analysis:
The bug is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. The failing test is due to the AmbiguousTimeError that occurs when using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency. The GitHub issue describes the expected behavior and the problem with handling the ambiguous timestamp.

2. Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the _get_time_bins function. This function seems to be responsible for creating bins based on time intervals, and it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

3. Bug's cause:
a. The buggy function (_get_time_bins) is responsible for creating bins and labels for the time intervals.
b. The related functions contain utility methods and do not seem to be directly related to the bug.
c. The failing test is testing the behavior of the problematic function and provides the error message related to the AmbiguousTimeError.
d. The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the expected behavior, the problem with handling ambiguous timestamps, and the versions of the libraries being used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the handling of ambiguous timestamps within the _get_time_bins function. This might involve checking for ambiguous timestamps and handling them appropriately to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code includes the use of the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter when creating the date range to handle ambiguous timestamps. This should address the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the bins and labels are created appropriately.
