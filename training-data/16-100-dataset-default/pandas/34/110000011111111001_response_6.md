The bug seems to be caused by the handling of timestamps in time zones with ambiguous times, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. 

The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, which does not handle ambiguous times caused by Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions properly.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function should be replaced with a more appropriate method, or the code should be modified to handle ambiguous times correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use the `.resample()` method on the DataFrame object, which is specifically designed for time-based resampling and avoids the pitfalls of the current implementation. 

After analyzing the failing test, it seems that the resampling is intended to work with the `mean` function on the grouped data. Therefore, the correct approach would be to use the `.resample()` method followed by the `mean` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function using the `.resample()` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    resampled = ax.to_frame().resample(self.freq)
    binner = resampled.first()
    labels = resampled.mean()

    return binner, [], labels
```

With the above correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should be able to handle time-based resampling more effectively and should pass the failing test.
