1. The function `_get_time_bins` is intended to process time series data and generate time bins and labels based on the frequency of the data. However, there are several potential issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. Potential error location: 
   - The use of `date_range` to generate `binner` and `labels` may result in incorrect calculation of time bins and labels.
   - Incorrect handling of labels and bins length mismatch.
   - Incorrect handling of `hasnans` in the data.

3. Elucidate the bug's cause:
   (a) The bug may be caused by the incorrect generation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, leading to mismatched time bins and labels.
   (b) The function does not handle the case when the length of the bins and labels is different, and it does not handle the `hasnans` attribute properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a different approach to generate `binner` and `labels` based on the frequency and range of the data.
   - Properly handle the case when the length of bins and labels is different, and handle the `hasnans` attribute to ensure accurate binning of the data.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, NaT, date_range
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bins, bin_edges = np.histogram(ax_values, bins='auto')
    bins = bins.astype(np.int64)

    binner = np.unique(bin_edges)
    labels = binner[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = np.insert(binner, 0, NaT)
        labels = np.insert(labels, 0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `np.histogram` to generate `bins` and `bin_edges` based on the data.
- Then, we obtain unique values from `bin_edges` as `binner` and use the unique values for `labels`.
- We handle the `hasnans` attribute by inserting `NaT` at the beginning of `binner` and `labels` if necessary.
- Finally, we ensure that the length of `labels` matches the length of `bins` before returning the results.
