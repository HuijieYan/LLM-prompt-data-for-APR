The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is likely caused by the `date_range` function being used to generate `binner` and `labels`. The date_range function is incorrectly being used to generate the date bins. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError during the test, as the generated bins are not correctly handling Daylight Saving Time changes, leading to repeated or ambiguous times.

To fix this issue, the `date_range` function should not be used to generate the bins, instead, the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function should be used to get the start and end timestamps, and then the bins should be generated based on these timestamps. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the labels and handling missing or extra labels should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate bins based on start and end timestamps
    binner = np.arange(first.value, last.value, self.freq.value, dtype='datetime64[ns]')
    
    if self.closed == 'right':
        bins = binner.searchsorted(ax.asi8, side='right')
    else:
        bins = binner.searchsorted(ax.asi8, side= 'left') - 1

    labels = binner.copy()
        
    if self.label == 'right':
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, -1)
        labels = np.insert(labels, 0, NaT)
    
    # adjusting the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the bins are generated correctly based on the start and end timestamps and that the labels are adjusted as necessary. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError during the test and make the function work as expected.
