The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the pandas library and is used in resampling datetime indexes. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` involves creating a DataFrame with hourly frequency and then grouping it by daily frequency, which triggers the `_get_time_bins` function. This ultimately leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a long clock change day in Cuba.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely the handling of ambiguous times during the grouping process, specifically when creating the time bins and labels.

Using the failing test and error message, it is clear that the `_get_time_bins` function is not handling ambiguous time properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test. The GitHub issue further explains that the specific timestamp causing the error is 2018-11-04 00:00:00, which is ambiguous due to the clock change in Cuba.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle ambiguous times correctly, especially in cases of daylight saving time transitions. This could involve adjusting the time bin creation process to account for ambiguous times and ensuring that time labels are assigned correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "right" else labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function includes adjustments to the time bin labeling process and properly handles ambiguous times. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and make the failing test pass.
