The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time in time zones with daylight savings time. This issue is consistent with the GitHub issue description, where a long clock-change day in Cuba leads to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of the time bins and labels, especially when dealing with Daylight Saving Time transitions. This can lead to incorrect labeling of the bins and ultimately result in the AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect generation of time bins and labels, especially around the transition points for daylight saving time. This causes the groupby operation to fail when handling ambiguous times, leading to the error reported in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Handling the ambiguous times explicitly by adjusting the time bins and labels according to the timezone transitions.
2. Updating the frequency handling and bin generation to account for daylight saving time transitions and ambiguous times.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = ax.round(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT')
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code resolves the issue by explicitly rounding the time bins to handle ambiguous times using the `round` method and setting `ambiguous='NaT'` to ensure that ambiguous times are represented as 'NaT'. This approach addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue and should handle the long clock-change day in Cuba without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
