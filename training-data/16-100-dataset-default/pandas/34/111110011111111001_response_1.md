The issue is originating from the `_get_time_bins` function, where the `last` value is being calculated as one day later than it should be. This is causing a mismatch in the expected vs actual time values, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input, and it uses the `first` and `last` variables to define the range. However, the calculation for `last` is incorrect, leading to the discrepancy.

To fix this issue, the calculation for `last` should be adjusted to be one day less than it currently is, in order to provide the correct time range for the bins.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max() - self.freq, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adjusting the calculation for `last` to be one interval less than the current max value of `ax`, it ensures that the time range for the bins is correctly aligned with the input data. With this correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should now produce the expected time bins and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
