The issue here seems to be related to the handling of the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the daylight saving time change. The error message indicates that the time at which the transition occurs is not properly handled by the function, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

Looking at the code and the input/output variable information, it seems that the function is not properly handling the transition time during the daylight saving time change. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised and the test failing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_time_bins` method. The function is not properly handling the daylight saving time transition, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the transition time during the daylight saving time change. This can be achieved by using the `infer` argument in the `date_range` function to handle ambiguous times during the daylight saving time transition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # handle ambiguous times during DST transition
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # existing code

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this modification, the `_get_time_bins` method should now handle the daylight saving time transition correctly, and the test should pass without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
