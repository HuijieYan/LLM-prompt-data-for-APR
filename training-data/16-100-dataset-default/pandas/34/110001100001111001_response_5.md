The bug in the code is likely located in the calculation of the bin_edges and bins. The line `binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)` should be adjusted. Additionally, the computation of bins should be revisited, as the actual output does not match with the expected output.

It seems that the bug may be caused due to incorrect handling of timezone information and calculation errors in the creation of the bin_edges and bins.

To fix the bug, we can consider revising the logic for computing `bin_edges` and `bins`, especially in relation to timezone information. Additionally, we may need to ensure that the `freq` parameter is being used correctly during the computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT, Day, TimeGrouper
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first = ax.min().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    last = ax.max().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)
    last += pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.values.astype(np.int64)
    bin_edges = binner.values.astype(np.int64)
    
    bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed == "right")
    
    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        bins = bins - 1
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, 0)  # assuming 0 represents NaN
    
    if len(bins) < len(binner):
        binner = binner[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, binner
```

This corrected code tries to address the issues with timezone, calculation of bin_edges and bins, and handling of missing values.
