1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is located within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is called by the `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` test in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` file. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError related to the clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the calculation of the time bins, particularly when handling the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, causing the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for calculating the time bins for grouping data based on a specified frequency. It performs various operations on the input timestamp index and frequency to generate the time bins.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class inherits from the `Grouper` class and contains multiple related functions for handling bin edges and adjusting bins.
   (c). The related `ax` function and `_adjust_bin_edges` function within the `TimeGrouper` class are called within the `_get_time_bins` function to perform additional operations on the time index.
   (d). The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` calls the `groupby` method with a daily frequency on a DataFrame, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba.
   (e). The GitHub issue provides context on the problem, indicating that the `groupby` should return three groups for each day, but fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible Fixes:
   - Handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time appropriately when calculating time bins.
   - Ensure that the `groupby` operation properly handles ambiguous timestamps during clock change days.

5. Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the transition from standard time to daylight saving time appropriately, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps on clock change days are handled correctly. This correction should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the `groupby` operation on the DataFrame returns the expected groups.
