The buggy function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group data with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The function is failing to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to the error.

The issue seems to be the handling of the timestamps around the clock change day. The function is not considering the ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamps properly by adjusting the bin edges and labels to account for the ambiguous time. Additionally, it should handle the timestamps with nanosecond precision correctly to avoid any errors related to the nanosecond part.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # existing code

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous time to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the existing code remains the same

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By setting the ambiguous time to NaT and adjusting the bin edges and labels accordingly, the corrected function should handle ambiguous timestamps properly and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
