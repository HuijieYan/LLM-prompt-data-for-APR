The issue seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time in the `pd.Grouper` function, particularly on a day with a clock change, as described in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the time bins and labels, especially around the ambiguous time due to the clock change.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of the time bins and labels, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the ambiguous time explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function by considering the time zone information during the creation of time bins and labels.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles the ambiguous time by using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter during the creation of time bins and labels, ensuring that the AmbiguousTimeError is not raised.

This should resolve the issue as described in the GitHub problem description, allowing the call to groupby to return the expected groups without errors.
