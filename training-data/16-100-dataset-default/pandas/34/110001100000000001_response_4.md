Potential error location: 

The potential error in the buggy function can be related to the calculation of the bins and labels. It seems that the calculation of the labels might be impacted by the conditionals for "right" and "hasnans" and the comparison between the length of bins and labels.

Bug's Cause:

The bug's cause can be due to incorrect label calculation and manipulation based on the conditions for "right" and "hasnans" and comparison of the lengths of bins and labels.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the conditions for "right" and "hasnans" are properly handled in calculating the labels.
2. Check and adjust the lengths of bins and labels to ensure they match.
3. Use appropriate data structures and methods to manipulate the labels and bins based on the given conditions.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]  # adjust the length of labels based on the length of bins

    return binner, bins, labels
