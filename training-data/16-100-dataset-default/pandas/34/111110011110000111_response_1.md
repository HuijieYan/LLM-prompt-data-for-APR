1. The buggy function is part of the TimeGrouper class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The failing test is testing the functionality of this class when trying to group by daily frequency, but it is raising an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the date range for grouping.

3. The buggy function is responsible for creating time bins for grouping. The class should be able to handle the ambiguous timestamps due to daylight saving time changes, but it is failing to do so, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError. The failing test code is the one that triggers the AmbiguousTimeError, and the GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, including the expected output and the environment in which the issue occurs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous times explicitly within the _get_time_bins function.
   - Using a different approach to create the bins that can handle ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles ambiguous times by using the "ambiguous" parameter in the date_range function. It also adjusts the labels based on the closed and label parameters, and inserts NaT if the axis has NaN values. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
