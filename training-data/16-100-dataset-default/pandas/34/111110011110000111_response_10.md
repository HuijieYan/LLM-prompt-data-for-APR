1. The buggy function is a method called _get_time_bins within the class TimeGrouper. The failing test function is test_downsample_dst_at_midnight, which is trying to group data using the pd.Grouper, and this causes an AmbiguousTimeError. This issue was reported on GitHub with the title "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba".

2. The potential error location within the _get_time_bins function is likely related to the handling of ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function _get_time_bins is failing to handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). The buggy class TimeGrouper is supposed to provide custom groupby functionality for time-interval grouping, but it seems to have a problem with handling ambiguous time.
   (c). The failing test test_downsample_dst_at_midnight is using pd.Grouper to group data, which triggers the AmbiguousTimeError due to the buggy behavior in the _get_time_bins function.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides details about the expected behavior, the problem description, and the version of pandas where the issue was observed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba within the _get_time_bins function.
   - Ensure that the custom groupby functionality provided by the TimeGrouper class can handle ambiguous time correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="shift_forward",  # Handle ambiguous time by shifting forward
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
With the above correction, the _get_time_bins function now handles ambiguous time by shifting it forward, which should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
