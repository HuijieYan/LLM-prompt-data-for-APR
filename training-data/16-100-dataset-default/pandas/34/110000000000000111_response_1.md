1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue as it is a part of the codebase that handles time binning and may be responsible for the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. This function is used to generate time bins for grouping time series data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially on the day of the clock change in the given time zone.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to create time bins for grouping time series data. It operates based on the frequency of the data and the timestamps in the index.
   (b). The GitHub issue indicates that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, the midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp which is not handled properly by the function.
   (c). This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when using the `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Handle ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change in the time zone.
   (b). Use appropriate logic to account for ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins.
   (c). Ensure that the time bins are generated correctly without leading to AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Generate time bins with handling for ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_froward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins with proper handling for ambiguous timestamps and closed intervals
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on closed intervals
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # Insert NaT for timestamps with NaN values
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code includes handling for ambiguous timestamps by using "NaT" and ensures that the time bins are generated without leading to the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days.
