    def __init__(self, freq, closed, label):
        self.freq = freq

            )

        if len(ax) == 0:

            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max() + timedelta(hours=1)  # Add 1 hour to account for the time change

        binner = pd.date_range(

        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed != "left")

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

The bug was fixed by adding 1 hour to the `last` timestamp to account for the time change during the ambiguous time. Additionally, the bins were recalculated using `np.digitize` to ensure the correct binning of the data.
