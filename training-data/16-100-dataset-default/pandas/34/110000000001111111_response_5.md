The buggy function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to execute the groupby operation due to a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in unexpected groups.

The potential error location within the function is likely related to the handling of timestamps around the clock change day in Cuba, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug's cause is related to the behavior of the function when dealing with timestamps near the clock change day, resulting in unexpected grouping and the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps around the clock change day in Cuba more effectively and ensure that the grouping operation does not encounter an AmbiguousTimeError.

The corrected code for the problematic function should include proper handling of timestamps around the clock change day in Cuba to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError and provide the expected groupings. The correction should ensure that the group labels and data points are correctly assigned for each day, even on the clock change day.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code handles the timestamp around the clock change day in Cuba effectively, ensuring that the grouping operation does not encounter an AmbiguousTimeError and provides the expected groupings.
