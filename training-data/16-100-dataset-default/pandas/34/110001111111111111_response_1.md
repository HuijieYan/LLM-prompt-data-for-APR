The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the ambiguous time at the beginning of the day during a clock change. This causes an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data.

To fix the bug, adjust the time bins labels for 'right' closed bins to properly handle the ambiguous time at the beginning of the day during a clock change.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    if self.closed == "right":
        # Adjust the  labels for 'right' closed bins to resolve the ambiguous time at the beginning of the day during a clock change
        labels -= self.freq

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix, the updated function should handle the ambiguous time correctly for 'right' closed bins and ensure that the tests pass without errors.

This correction should resolve the issue and satisfy the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
