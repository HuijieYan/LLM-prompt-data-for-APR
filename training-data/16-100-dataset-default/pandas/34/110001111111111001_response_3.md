The bug in the _get_time_bins function seems to be related to the timezone conversion and handling of daylight saving time (DST). The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised from the tz_localize_to_utc function in the date_range function. This suggests that there is an ambiguous time conversion happening, which is likely due to daylight saving time changes.

The issue seems to be with the timezone handling and label assignment in the _get_time_bins function. The function should consider the presence of ambiguous times, especially when transitioning to or from DST.

To fix the bug, the timezone handling and label assignment in the _get_time_bins function should be carefully adjusted to handle the presence of ambiguous times, especially when transitioning to or from DST. Additionally, the conversion from localized time to UTC should be handled properly to avoid ambiguous time errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + Timedelta(days=1),  # add 1 day to include the last day's data
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the date_range for 'binner' includes an additional day specified by `last + Timedelta(days=1)` to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError. This ensures that the last day's data is included in the range, preventing issues related to ambiguous time conversion.

With these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle timezone and ambiguous time issues properly, and should pass the failing test.
