The error message "pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times" indicates that the bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the time binning and labeling logic is implemented. The error occurs when the logic for handling ambiguous times within the `tz_localize_to_utc` function does not successfully account for repeated times.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the `binner = labels = date_range(...)` part of the code that constructs the bins and labels for time range. It seems that the issue is related to handling ambiguous times when creating the bins and labels.

To fix the bug, we can consider adjusting the handling of ambiguous times during the creation of bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. Additionally, we may need to ensure that the logic for handling repeated times in the time range is robust.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, adjustments have been made to ensure proper handling of ambiguous times during the creation of bins and labels. The handling of repeated times within the time range has been improved to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the failing test.
