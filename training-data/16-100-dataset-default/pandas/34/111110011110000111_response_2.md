1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom class for time-interval grouping. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to use the `TimeGrouper` class to group time data, but it is encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is coming from the `date_range` function inside the `_get_time_bins` method, which is being used to create the time bins for grouping.

2. The potential error location is within the `date_range` function call inside the `_get_time_bins` method, which seems to be causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. The cause of the bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on a clock change day, specifically in the timezone of America/Havana. This was reported as a bug on GitHub and the failing test is trying to demonstrate this issue. The failing test is essentially trying to group data using the `TimeGrouper` class with a daily frequency (`freq='1D'`), and encountering an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in a more robust manner within the `_get_time_bins` method.
   - Use a different approach for creating time bins that handles ambiguous timestamps more effectively.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class that resolves the issue:

```python
from pandas import DateOffset

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other methods and class members)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = ax.min().normalize(), ax.max().normalize() + DateOffset(days=1)
        binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` method should now handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in a more robust manner, and the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass successfully, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
