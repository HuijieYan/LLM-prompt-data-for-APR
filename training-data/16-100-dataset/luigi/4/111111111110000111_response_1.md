The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line. The error message indicates that the code is trying to call `len()` on a NoneType object, which is not allowed.

The bug's cause is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is not being properly handled when it is set to None. This causes the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line to throw a TypeError.

To fix the bug, you can add a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when the `columns` attribute is set to None.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This change should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test case. It also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
