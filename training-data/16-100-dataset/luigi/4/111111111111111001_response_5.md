The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None properly, resulting in a TypeError.

The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not checking whether `self.columns` is None before trying to determine its length with `len(self.columns)`.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before trying to determine its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this fix, the buggy function should now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is None, and the failing test should pass.
