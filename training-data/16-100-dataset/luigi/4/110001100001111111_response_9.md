The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which throws a TypeError when self.columns is None. This is inline with the GitHub issue description which identifies this line as the root cause.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if self.columns exists and is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code includes the fix to the condition that was causing the TypeError. It checks if self.columns exists and is not None before attempting to get its length.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug by handling the case where self.columns is None.
