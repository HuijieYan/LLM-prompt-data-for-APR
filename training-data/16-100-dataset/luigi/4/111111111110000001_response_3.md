1. The buggy function is `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. It is related to the functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` within the same file. The failing test is in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` and it's corresponding error message is a `TypeError` which occurs when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is a `NoneType` object causing the error.

3. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine if there are any columns. However, if `self.columns` is `None` (which it is in the failing test), it will raise a `TypeError` because `NoneType` objects do not have a length.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `if` condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then check for the length of the columns.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. Additionally, in the `cursor.execute` call, we added parentheses to `self.copy_options` to call the function and obtain the options.
