Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. Since `self.columns` can be None, this will result in a TypeError.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is None or not.
(b). The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly related to the bug since the issue lies in the `copy` function.
(c). The discrepancy lies in the fact that when columns are not provided, the buggy function throws a TypeError, which is not the expected behavior.
(d). The GitHub issue mentioned that when `columns` are set to None to prohibit table creation, the Redshift COPY job fails. The root cause is identified as a condition that checks the length of `self.columns` without considering the case where `self.columns` is None.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not None before checking its length.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is None separately to avoid the TypeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` ensures that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement and resolves the TypeError that occurs when `self.columns` is None.
