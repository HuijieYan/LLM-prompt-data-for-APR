1. The buggy function is a part of a Redshift class in the luigi package. It is a function that defines copying from S3 into Redshift. The function is expecting a 'columns' attribute to determine whether to include column names in the SQL query it constructs. The related functions '_credentials' and 'copy_options' are not directly related to the bug, but they are called within the buggy function to obtain credentials and options for the copy operation. 

The GitHub issue indicates that when the 'columns' attribute is set to None to prohibit table creation, the Redshift COPY operation fails with a TypeError because it tries to call 'len' on a None type. The cause of the bug is identified as a specific line within the buggy function that checks the length of the 'self.columns' attribute without first checking if it exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line attempts to check the length of 'self.columns' without first checking if it exists, leading to a TypeError when 'self.columns' is set to None.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function tries to construct a SQL query for the Redshift COPY operation, but it wrongly assumes the existence of the 'self.columns' attribute without checking if it exists or has a valid value (such as None).
   (b). The related functions '_credentials' and 'copy_options' do not directly contribute to the bug's cause.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides details about the bug, indicating that it occurs when 'columns' is set to None, and suggests a possible solution to check for the existence of 'self.columns'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if 'self.columns' exists before attempting to access its length.
   - If 'self.columns' exists, then check its length to determine if column names need to be included in the SQL query.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if 'self.columns' exists before attempting to access its length. If it exists, then we proceed to check its length to determine if column names need to be included in the SQL query. This change addresses the underlying cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue and resolves the TypeError issue when 'columns' is set to None.
