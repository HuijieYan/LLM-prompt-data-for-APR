1. The buggy function is a Python function that is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. It uses string formatting to dynamically generate the SQL query for the COPY command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of string formatting to generate the SQL query for the COPY command. There is a missing closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() method.

3. The bug's cause is that the cursor.execute() method is missing a closing parenthesis, causing a syntax error.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a closing parenthesis to the cursor.execute() method and ensure that the string formatting placeholders are correctly filled in.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
     )
```
