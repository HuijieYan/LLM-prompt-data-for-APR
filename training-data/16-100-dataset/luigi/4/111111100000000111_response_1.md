1. The buggy function is the copy function within the S3CopyToTable class. This class inherits from rdbms.CopyToTable and _CredentialsMixin. The copy function performs a Redshift COPY command but has an issue when the self.columns attribute is empty. The related functions _credentials and copy_options are also within the same file, and the issue is mentioned in a GitHub issue related to luigi 2.7.1, where Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided.

2. The potential error location within the copy function is the line where it checks the length of self.columns. If self.columns is empty, it will raise a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function (copy) tries to construct a Redshift COPY command based on the self.columns attribute, but it does not handle the case where self.columns is empty.
   (b). The buggy class (S3CopyToTable) does not provide a default behavior for handling the case where self.columns is not provided.
   (c). The related function _credentials and copy_options do not directly contribute to the bug but are part of the same class and file.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information mentions that the bug occurs when columns = None is used to prohibit table creation, and suggests a possible solution by checking if self.columns exists before checking its length.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if self.columns exists before checking its length in the copy function.
   - Provide a default behavior for handling the case where self.columns is not provided in the S3CopyToTable class.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function (copy) to address the bug and satisfy the GitHub issue:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for self.columns before accessing its length. This ensures that the code does not raise a TypeError when self.columns is not provided. This change addresses the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue and should resolve the issue for Redshift COPY jobs in luigi 2.7.1.
