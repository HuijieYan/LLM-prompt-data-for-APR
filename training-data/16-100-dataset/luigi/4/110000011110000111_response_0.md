The buggy function `copy` in the given code is failing because it's checking the length of `self.columns`, which is None in the failing test case. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType`.

In the failing test, `columns` is set to `None` when creating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which is then passed to the `copy` function. This triggers the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition in the `copy` function and leads to the `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue also provides insight into the root cause of the bug and suggests a potential solution by changing the `if` condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `if` condition first checks if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length. This change will fix the `TypeError` issue observed in the failing test case.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
