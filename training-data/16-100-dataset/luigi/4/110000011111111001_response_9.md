Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the if statement checking the length of self.columns. Since self.columns is None when the columns parameter is not provided, the function is encountering a TypeError when trying to check the length of the NoneType object.

Bug's Cause: The function is assuming that self.columns will always be a list, and it is not handling the case when it is None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if self.columns is None before trying to access its length.
2. If self.columns is None, handle the case appropriately by setting colnames to an empty string.

Corrected Code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should handle the case where self.columns is None and prevent the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
