The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the length of self.columns. The error is occurring because the buggy code does not handle the case when the self.columns attribute is None.

The cause of the bug is that when the self.columns attribute is None, the buggy code is still trying to access its length, resulting in a TypeError. This is in line with the information provided in the GitHub issue, which states that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns=None to prohibit table creation fails.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adding a check for None before trying to access the length of self.columns.
2. Setting a default value for self.columns if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Adding a check for None before accessing the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code will now handle the case when self.columns is None, and will not result in a TypeError.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
