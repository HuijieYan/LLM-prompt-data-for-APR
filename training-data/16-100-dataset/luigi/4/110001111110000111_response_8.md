### Analysis
The bug is caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` because you cannot call `len()` on a `NoneType` object. The failing test is trying to call the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, which then calls the `copy` method with `columns=None`. This causes the bug to manifest and the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when the length of `self.columns` is checked.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle that case appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With the above corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass. This fix also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by ensuring that the `copy` method handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
