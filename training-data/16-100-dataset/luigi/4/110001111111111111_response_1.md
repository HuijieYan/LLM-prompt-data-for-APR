The bug is in the portion of code that checks the length of self.columns. When columns is None, the if statement `if len(self.columns) > 0` raises a TypeError because None does not have a length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the if statement to check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the code will check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, avoiding the TypeError that was raised previously.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
