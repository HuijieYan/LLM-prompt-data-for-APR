The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement that checks the length of self.columns.

The bug's cause is due to the check for the length of self.columns without first confirming that self.columns is not None. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None.

To fix the bug, we can update the if statement to first check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the code will first check if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length, preventing the TypeError. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue.
