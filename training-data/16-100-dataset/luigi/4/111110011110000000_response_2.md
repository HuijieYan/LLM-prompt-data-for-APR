The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has several issues that need to be fixed. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Changes made:
1. Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
2. Changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` as it is a function call instead of a simple attribute.

With these changes, the `TypeError` due to the `NoneType` columns should be resolved.
