The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes an error when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the buggy function. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. We can do this by using an `if` statement to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and only then proceed with checking its length and formatting `colnames`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code:
1. We first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length and format `colnames` accordingly.
2. The `self.copy_options` method is also properly invoked.

With these changes, the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and should pass the failing test.
