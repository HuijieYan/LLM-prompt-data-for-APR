The bug in the function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The issue is that it doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the problem occurs when `columns = None` to prohibit table creation.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. We also need to modify the GitHub issue description to include the proposed fix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
