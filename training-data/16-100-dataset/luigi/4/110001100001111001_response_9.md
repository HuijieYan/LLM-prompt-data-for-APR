The bug in the provided function is with the line `creds=self._credentials()`. The `_credentials` function is being called as a method of the class, but it is a standalone function. The same issue is also present with `options=self.copy_options`, as `copy_options` is also a standalone function.

To fix the bug, the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions should be called directly, without using `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=_credentials(),
        options=copy_options())
    )
```

With this fix, the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are called directly, and the bug in the original code should be resolved.
