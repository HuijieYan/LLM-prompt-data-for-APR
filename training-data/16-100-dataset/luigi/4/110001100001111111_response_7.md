The issue seems to be with the check for the length of the columns. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to get the length of `None`, which causes the TypeError. The GitHub issue also suggests the same problem.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Use an empty list if `self.columns` is None, to avoid any issues with `join` later in the code.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should resolve the TypeError when `self.columns` is None and also address the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
