1. The buggy function is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine whether to specify column names in the COPY statement. There is a related function `copy_options` and another function `_credentials` in the same file.

The GitHub issue mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails in luigi 2.7.1 with a TypeError due to an object of type 'NoneType' having no length.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in this line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```

3. (a). The buggy function uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine whether to include column names in the copy statement.
   (b). The `S3CopyToTable` class contains the buggy function and is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
   (c). The related functions are `_credentials` and `copy_options` which are called by the buggy function.
   (d). The GitHub issue information explains that the issue arises when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation. The root cause seems to be related to the condition checking the length of `self.columns`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
   - Use a more robust approach to handle cases where `self.columns` is None.

5. Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
