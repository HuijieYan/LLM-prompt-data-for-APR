1. The buggy function is a method called `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class. This class is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3. It has a method called `copy_options` which is called by the `copy` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `cursor.execute` statement. There is a missing `()` after `self.copy_options`.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to execute a COPY command using the `cursor.execute()` method. It constructs the SQL command as a string using string formatting and then attempts to execute it.
   (b). The `S3CopyToTable` class is designed to insert a data set into Redshift from s3 using the `COPY` command, and it includes a method for specifying copy options.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.copy_options` method is called and its return value is included in the SQL command being executed. This can be achieved by adding `()` after `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses after self.copy_options
    )
```
