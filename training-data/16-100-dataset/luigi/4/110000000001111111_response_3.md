The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement checking the length of the columns. The error is likely occurring because the 'columns' attribute is set to None, which causes an error when trying to check its length.

The bug's cause is that the code does not handle the case when columns are not provided. This causes a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length.
2. If self.columns is None, set colnames to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function based on the suggestion:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code checks if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length, and sets colnames to an empty string if self.columns is None. This should resolve the TypeError when columns are not provided and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should also address the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
