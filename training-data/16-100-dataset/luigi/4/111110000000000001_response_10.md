The potential error in the buggy function is in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `options` parameter is calling the `self.copy_options` method, but it needs to be called as `self.copy_options()` instead.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `self.copy_options` method. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method with `()` at the end to properly execute the method and get its result.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The bug has been fixed by changing `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()`. Now the `copy_options` method will be properly executed and the bug should be resolved.
