The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional check for the length of self.columns.

The bug's cause is that when self.columns is None, the buggy function tries to use len(self.columns), resulting in a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
