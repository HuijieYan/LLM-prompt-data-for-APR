Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `cursor.execute` statement in the `copy` function. The `self.copy_options` is being passed as a method without calling it, which is causing the bug.

Bug's cause:
- The `copy` function is not correctly using the `copy_options` method to get the options for the copy query. Instead, it is directly using the method reference, which leads to incorrect SQL query generation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Call the `copy_options` method to get the options for the copy query before passing it to the `cursor.execute` statement.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the method to get the options
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Use the obtained options
    )
```
