The issue with the buggy function is that the SQL query inside the `cursor.execute` block is not properly formatted. The `colnames` variable is used within the SQL query, but it is not properly handled when it is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is being used inside the SQL query without checking if it is empty, which leads to syntax errors in the generated SQL query.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to dynamically add the `colnames` portion to the SQL query only if it is not empty.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:  # only add colnames if it's not empty
        colnames = ' ' + colnames

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `colnames` portion is only added to the SQL query if it is not empty. This should resolve the syntax errors when `colnames` is empty and provide the correct SQL query structure based on the input parameters.
