1. The buggy function is located within the class S3CopyToTable in the redshift.py file, specifically the copy method. The related functions are _credentials and copy_options, which are called within the copy method. The failing test is testing the functionality of S3CopyToTable with nonetype columns, and the error message indicates a TypeError due to the attempt to get the length of a NoneType object.

2. The potential error location is within the if statement in the copy method, specifically in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to access the length of self.columns without checking if it is None.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is being set to None, and the copy method is not handling this correctly, leading to a TypeError when it attempts to get the length of None.

4. To fix the bug, the copy method should be modified to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This can be done by adding a check for None before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, a check for `self.columns` being not None is added before attempting to get the length, preventing the TypeError. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` call is corrected to include parentheses to call the function.
