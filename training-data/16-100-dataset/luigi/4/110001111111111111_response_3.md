Potential error location: The error occurs when trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is set to None when not provided.

Bug cause:
The function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but when it's not provided, it's set to None, and hence, it raises a TypeError when it tries to check the length of None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Provide a default value for `self.columns` to avoid setting it to None.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will pass the failing test and also satisfy the input/output variable information provided. It resolves the issue raised in the GitHub post.
