The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect handling of the columns attribute when it is set to None. The buggy function is trying to check the length of self.columns without first checking if it is not None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the buggy function to first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to check its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if self.columns is not None before proceeding to check its length. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring when self.columns was set to None.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also pass the failing test provided.
