1. In the provided code, the buggy function is `copy` inside the class `S3CopyToTable` which is a subclass of `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`. The failing test attempts to test the case where `columns` are set to `None`, and the error message shows a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
   (b) The failing test is trying to test the case where `columns` are set to `None`, causing the `TypeError`.
   (c) The error message clearly indicates that the code is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
   (d) The GitHub issue highlights that the bug is causing Redshift COPY jobs to fail when `columns` are set to `None`, and it suggests a possible solution.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

   - Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length within the `copy` function.
   - Update the conditional statement to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
   - Make sure the code gracefully handles the scenario when `columns` are set to `None` in the `copy` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` are set to `None`. This will ensure that the failing test passes and that the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
