Potential error location:
The issue lies in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Bug's Cause:
The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the scenario when `columns` is None. This triggers the TypeError due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function. The GitHub issue further confirms that this is a known issue in luigi 2.7.1.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible solution is to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. Another approach is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code includes the suggested fix to handle the scenario when `self.columns` is None. This modification ensures that the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
