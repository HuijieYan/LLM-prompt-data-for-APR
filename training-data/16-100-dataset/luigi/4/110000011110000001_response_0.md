The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This line is trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None.

The bug is caused by the `self.columns` being None, and then attempting to retrieve the length of None, which results in a TypeError. This is identified in the failing test message, where it says "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()".

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can do this by adding a check for None before trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and should pass the failing test.
