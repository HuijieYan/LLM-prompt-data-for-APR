The issue in the provided code is that the `self.columns` attribute is being set to `None` and is not being handled properly before checking its length in the `copy` function. To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for self.columns not being None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Changes made:
- Added a check for `self.columns` to be not `None` before checking its length.
- In the `.format()` method, called `self.copy_options` as a function `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options` to correctly get the options.
