The problem in the given code is that it is trying to check the length of a NoneType object, which is causing a TypeError. This is happening because the `self.columns` variable is set to `None` in the test case, and the code is checking if its length is greater than 0.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This will prevent the TypeError and the function will work as expected.
