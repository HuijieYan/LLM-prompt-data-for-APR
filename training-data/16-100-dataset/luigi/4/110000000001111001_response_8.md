The bug in the provided function is that there is a missing closing parenthesis in the call to cursor.execute(). This is causing a syntax error in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, the missing closing parenthesis should be added at the end of the cursor.execute() call.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly execute the SQL query without any syntax errors.
