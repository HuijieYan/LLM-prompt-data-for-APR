1. The buggy function is `copy` which is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test this `copy` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to access the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is causing the `TypeError`.

3. The bug is caused because the `columns` attribute is being set as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. The `if` condition in the `copy` method tries to access the length of `None`, resulting in the `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, thereby avoiding the `TypeError`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` method will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and won't try to access its length, thereby fixing the `TypeError` issue. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
