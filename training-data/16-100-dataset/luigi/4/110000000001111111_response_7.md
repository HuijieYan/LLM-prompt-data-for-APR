The issue in the buggy function is that it doesn't check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get the length of it. This causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`. 

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem arises when `self.columns` is `None` and the function is attempting to get the length of it. The proposed solution is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get the length of it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before it attempts to get the length, avoiding the TypeError that was reported in the GitHub issue. This fix addresses the problem highlighted in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function works as expected.
