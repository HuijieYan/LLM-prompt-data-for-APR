The potential error in the function is that the COPY SQL statement is not being executed properly due to incorrect formatting of the query string.

The bug's cause is the incorrect formatting of the query string that is being passed to the cursor.execute() method. The colnames variable is being set to an empty string, which is causing the formatting of the COPY SQL statement to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to properly format the query string that is being passed to the cursor.execute() method. We also need to ensure that the colnames variable is properly set with the column names if they exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ','.join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected code, we are properly checking if columns exist and setting the colnames variable accordingly. This will ensure that the COPY SQL statement is formatted correctly and executed as expected.
