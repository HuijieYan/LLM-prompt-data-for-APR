The buggy function is attempting to call the len() function on a NoneType object, which is causing the TypeError. To fix this, we can check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring and resolve the issue.
