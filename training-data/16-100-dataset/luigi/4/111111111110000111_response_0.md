The bug is caused by the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is due to the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` which throws a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly related to the bug, but the `_CredentialsMixin` class is inherited by the `S3CopyToTable` class and could have an impact on the bug.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` method with `columns=None`, and it's expecting the `COPY` statement to execute without any issues. However, the `TypeError` is raised because of `len(self.columns)` when `columns` is `None`.

The GitHub issue title and description provide insights into the root cause of the bug and suggest a possible solution to fix it by changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition in the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue. It satisfies the failing test and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
