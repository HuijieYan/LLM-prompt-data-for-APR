The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. Here, the code is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list and trying to check its length, which can result in a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.

The bug's cause is that when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation, it fails with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This way, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, we are checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, which will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
