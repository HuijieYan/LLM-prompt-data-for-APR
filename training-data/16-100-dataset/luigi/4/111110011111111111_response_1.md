The potential error location within the problematic function is within the if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' has no len() when trying to check the length of self.columns, which means self.columns is equal to None.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy code is not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is None. The failing test confirms this as it passes `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, causing `self.columns` to be None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, resolving the TypeError issue. This code will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, effectively resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
