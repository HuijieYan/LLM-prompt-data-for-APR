The potential error within the buggy function is that the `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. This is causing the `copy_options` function to not be executed, and the options for the COPY command are not being set.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and retrieve the options as a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    # ... (other class code)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        # Call copy_options and retrieve the options as a string
        options = self.copy_options()
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```
