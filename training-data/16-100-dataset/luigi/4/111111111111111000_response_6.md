The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can fix this by adding a condition to check for this case and set `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate the `colnames`. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will be set to an empty string as required.

After applying this fix, the test case should pass without any errors.
