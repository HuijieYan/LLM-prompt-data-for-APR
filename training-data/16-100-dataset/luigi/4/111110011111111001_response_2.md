The bug is caused by the buggy function attempting to use the `len` function on the `self.columns` attribute, which is `None` in this case. This triggers a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len` property.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to perform any operation on it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, the `if` condition will evaluate to `False` and the code inside the block will not be executed, thus preventing the `TypeError`.
