The potential error in the code is the missing closing parenthesis for the cursor.execute() method. This is causing a syntax error and the function is not executing properly.

To fix the bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() method call.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )  # added closing parenthesis here
```

With this correction, the function should behave as expected and execute the SQL COPY command properly.
