The bug is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue is that the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

The bug is being triggered by a test case where `self.columns` is set to `None`. In this case, when the `len(self.columns) > 0` line is executed, it causes a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None` and does not support the `len()` operation.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" accurately describes the problem by indicating that the bug occurs when `columns` is set to `None`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code includes the suggested fix and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread. It will ensure that the `copy` function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
