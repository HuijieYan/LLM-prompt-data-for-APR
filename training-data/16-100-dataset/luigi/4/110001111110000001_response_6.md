1. The buggy function is `copy` in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file. It is a method that defines copying from S3 into Redshift. The `copy` function utilizes the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods, but they are not defined within the scope of the `copy` function. The failing test is checking for a situation when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the `NoneType` not having a length.

2. The potential error location is when checking the length of `self.columns`.

3. The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line within the `copy` function. The test creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns=None`, which causes the `TypeError` when attempting to check the length of `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This can be achieved by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `copy` function to handle the `None` case:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
