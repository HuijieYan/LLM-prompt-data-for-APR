The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides columns as None to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object and calls the `run` method. The run method then calls the `copy` method which eventually results in a TypeError due to the length check on `self.columns`.

The GitHub issue details the problem as occurring when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None in luigi 2.7.1 and proposes a possible solution of changing the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix the bug, we need to include a check for `self.columns` being not None before checking for its length. Therefore, the corrected code for the `copy` function should include this check.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` line will check whether `self.columns` is not None before attempting to check its length, effectively resolving the bug.

This fix should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
