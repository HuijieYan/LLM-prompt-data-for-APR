The issue in the buggy function is caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it throws a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This is in line with the failing test which passes `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` constructor, and the GitHub issue also points out that this is the root cause of the problem.

To address this issue, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calling `len()` on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will now handle the `NoneType` input for columns and prevent the `TypeError` from being raised. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
