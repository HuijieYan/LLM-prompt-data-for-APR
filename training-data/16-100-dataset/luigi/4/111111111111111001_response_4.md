The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. The code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not None, leading to a TypeError when it's None.

To fix this issue, the buggy function needs to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it's None, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check that self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. We added a check for `self.columns and` before checking its length to avoid a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
2. In the `cursor.execute` call, we added parenthesis `()` for the `self.copy_options` function call.

This amended code should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
