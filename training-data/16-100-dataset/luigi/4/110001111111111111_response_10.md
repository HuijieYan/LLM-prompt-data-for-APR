The buggy function is the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is failing with a TypeError because when `self.columns` is None, the function is trying to check the length of None, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the buggy function is identified to be the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This is where the function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None.

The bug's cause is as follows:
(a). The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not None.
(b). The failing test is providing the input parameter `columns` as None, causing the bug to surface.
(c). The error message is a TypeError stating that 'NoneType' has no len().
(d). The expected input/output variable value and type indicate that `self.columns` is None, which causes the error.

The GitHub issue details a similar bug where Redshift COPY fails when columns are not provided. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected code for the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code will fix the bug and satisfy the failing test, as well as address the issue reported on GitHub.
