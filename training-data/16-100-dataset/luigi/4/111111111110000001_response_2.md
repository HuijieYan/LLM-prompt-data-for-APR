1. The problematic function is `copy` which is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift using a COPY query. The function seems to be failing due to an attempted comparison of the `columns` attribute with `None` in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, resulting in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` has no length.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

3. The bug's cause is due to the comparison of `NoneType` with an integer in the `copy` function. The `columns` attribute of the class `S3CopyToTable` is expected to be a list that holds information about the columns to be copied, but in the failing test, it is set to `None`, resulting in the TypeError when the function tries to check the length of the attribute. The failing test also confirms that the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function to check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to perform the comparison. We will also handle the case when the `columns` attribute is `None` and set the `colnames` variable accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when `columns` is `None`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
