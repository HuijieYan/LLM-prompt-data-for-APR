The issue is related to the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, resulting in a TypeError because the code tries to find the length of a `NoneType` object.

The code in the `copy` function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying that `self.columns` is not `None`. This causes the error when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition in the `copy` function to also check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.

The corrected code for the `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and the code will no longer raise a TypeError. This fix satisfies the requirements of passing the failing test and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
