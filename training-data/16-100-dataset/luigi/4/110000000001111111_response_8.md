The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The issue is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function will throw a TypeError, as shown in the GitHub issue.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. The code assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This can be done by checking if `self.columns` exists first, and then checking its length.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns exists and has a length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This code will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue. The check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` ensures that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it actually exists.
