The bug in the provided code is that the `self.columns` attribute is not properly handled when it is not provided (i.e., when it is `None`). This leads to a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

The GitHub issue explains that the problem arises when `self.columns` is set to `None` in order to prohibit table creation but this causes the COPY command to fail due to the incorrect handling of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be updated to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. Instead of directly checking the length of `self.columns`, we should first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not None, preventing the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

With this fix, the code should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None, as reported in the GitHub issue, and the TypeError should no longer occur.
