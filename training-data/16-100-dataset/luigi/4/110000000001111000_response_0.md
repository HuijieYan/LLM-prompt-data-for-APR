To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the SQL query is properly formatted and executed. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
import logging

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The changes made in the corrected version of the function include:
1. Importing the logging module and creating a logger object to use for logging.
2. Checking if `self.columns` is not an empty list using `if self.columns` instead of `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
3. Properly formatting the `COPY` SQL query with placeholders for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
4. Replacing `logger.info` with `logger.info` to use the logger object.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly execute the `COPY` command in Redshift.
