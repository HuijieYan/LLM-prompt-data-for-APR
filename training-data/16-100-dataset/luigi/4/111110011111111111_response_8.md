The issue is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test provides `columns=None` as input, which causes the function to throw a `TypeError` when attempting to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We will also update the GitHub issue to reflect the suggested solution.

Here are the potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Update the `copy` function to only check the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and will not attempt to check the length of `self.columns` if it is `None`. This change should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
