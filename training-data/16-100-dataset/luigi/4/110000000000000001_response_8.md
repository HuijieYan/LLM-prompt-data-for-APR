1. The buggy function is a method for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It uses string formatting to build a SQL query for the COPY command. 

2. The potential error location is within the cursor.execute() block where the SQL query is being built.

3. The bug is caused by improper string formatting and missing quotation marks around the credentials.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that all placeholders in the SQL query are properly formatted and that the credentials are enclosed in single quotes.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=your_access_key,
        secret_key=your_secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
