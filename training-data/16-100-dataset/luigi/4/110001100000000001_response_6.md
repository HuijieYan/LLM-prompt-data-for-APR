Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function is in the line where the SQL query is executed using cursor.execute. The function call to self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not used correctly, and they should be called as methods of the class.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the _credentials and copy_options methods correctly. The functions are defined as instance methods, but they are being called as if they were standalone functions. This results in a syntax error when trying to execute the SQL query.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the _credentials and copy_options methods using self.
2. Pass the cursor and f parameters to the related methods if necessary.

Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
