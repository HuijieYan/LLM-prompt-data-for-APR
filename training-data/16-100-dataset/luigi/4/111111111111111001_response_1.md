The root cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the `self` object (which is an instance of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class), but it is `None`, and the function does not handle this case properly, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by performing a check for this condition before accessing the length of the `self.columns` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The changes made in this corrected code involve adding a check for `self.columns` before accessing its length in the `if` statement, and also calling the `self.copy_options` method instead of just accessing it as an attribute.

With these changes, the `copy` function should now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and it should pass the failing test mentioned.
