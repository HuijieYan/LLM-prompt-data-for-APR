1. The buggy function is supposed to copy data from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift. It uses SQL COPY command with dynamic table and column names.

2. The potential error in the code is in the cursor.execute() call where the SQL query is being executed. There is a syntax error in the SQL query.

3. The bug is caused by the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() call. The last closing parenthesis is missing, leading to a syntax error in the SQL query.

4. To fix the bug, we can add the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() call. We also need to ensure that the SQL query is properly formatted with the correct table and column names, as well as the credentials and options.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
        ))
```
