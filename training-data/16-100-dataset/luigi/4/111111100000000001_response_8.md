The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the `self.copy_options` property without calling it as a function. Additionally, the `COPY` query in the `cursor.execute` statement is missing the `FROM` keyword.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function should be called as a method, and the `FROM` keyword should be added to the `COPY` query.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    # ... (other class code)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `copy_options` method is now called using `self.copy_options()`, and the `FROM` keyword has been added to the `COPY` query inside the `cursor.execute` statement.
