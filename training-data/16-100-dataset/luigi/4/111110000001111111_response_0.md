The potential error in the buggy function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns. This is causing a TypeError when self.columns is None.

The cause of the bug is that the if statement is not checking if self.columns is None before trying to get the length of it. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to see if self.columns is not None before trying to get the length of it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the bug should be fixed, and the function should no longer throw a TypeError when self.columns is None. This will also address the issue reported on GitHub.
