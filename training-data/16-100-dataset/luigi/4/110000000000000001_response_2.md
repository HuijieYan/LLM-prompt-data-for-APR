1. The buggy function is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift using the COPY command. However, there is a syntax error in the cursor.execute() function call, as it is missing a closing parenthesis at the end.

2. The potential error location is within the cursor.execute() function call, specifically in the string formatting and the missing closing parenthesis at the end.

3. The bug's cause is that the string formatting in the cursor.execute() function call is incomplete and missing a closing parenthesis, causing a syntax error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to complete the string formatting and add the missing closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() call.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''  
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options))
```
