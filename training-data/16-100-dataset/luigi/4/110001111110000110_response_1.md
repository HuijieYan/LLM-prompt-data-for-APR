# The fixed version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The main issue in the provided code is that it does not check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. When `self.columns` is None, it causes a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

The conditions inside the `copy` function have been updated to check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to get its length. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` function was missing parentheses to call the function, so it has been fixed as well.

These changes should address the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are not provided.
