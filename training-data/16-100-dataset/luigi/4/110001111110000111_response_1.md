The potential error in the buggy function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type 'NoneType' and hence it cannot have a length.

The cause of the bug is that when `columns` is None, the code doesn't handle this case properly and tries to perform operations on it assuming it's a non-empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None by checking for this condition before attempting to get its length.

We can update the code in the `copy` function as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we are checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

With this fix, the code should pass the failing test and should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

If the GitHub issue is still open, the corrected code can be submitted there as a proposed solution.
