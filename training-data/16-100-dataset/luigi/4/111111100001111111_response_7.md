The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This leads to a TypeError when trying to get the length of self.columns, which is of type NoneType.

The potential error location is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which doesn't check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes `self.columns` will always have a value, but it doesn't handle the case when it is None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected code handles the case when `self.columns` is None by checking if it is not None before trying to get its length. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
