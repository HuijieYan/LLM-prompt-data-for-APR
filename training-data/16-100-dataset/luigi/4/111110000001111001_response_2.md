The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function. Also, the `colnames` variable is being defined but not used in the `cursor.execute` statement.

The bug's cause is that the `copy_options` function is not being called and the `colnames` variable is not being used in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and use the `colnames` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly call the `copy_options` function and use the `colnames` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement. This will resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
