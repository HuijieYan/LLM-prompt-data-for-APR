The potential error location within the problematic function is the `cursor.execute` block. The `self.copy_options` variable is not being called as a function, and it appears to be missing the parentheses, which is likely causing the bug.

The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function should be called as a method and its return value should be included in the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options as a method
    )
```

With this change, the `copy_options` function is called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` command, resolving the bug.
