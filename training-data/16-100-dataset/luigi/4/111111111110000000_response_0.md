The issue in the copy function is that it's trying to get the length of the self.columns, but it's not handling the case where self.columns is None. We can fix this by checking if self.columns is None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected version of the copy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Changes made:
- Added a check for self.columns before getting its length to avoid TypeError when it's None
- Changed `self.copy_options` to call `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the copy_options method

With these changes, the TypeError should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
