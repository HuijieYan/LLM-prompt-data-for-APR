Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to build a query using the `self.columns` attribute without checking if it is None, which leads to a TypeError when attempting to access its length.

Bug cause:
(a). The buggy function is attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None, leading to a TypeError.
(b). There is an issue with the logic in the buggy function that does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
(c). The GitHub issue indicates that providing columns as None to prohibit table creation is causing the Redshift COPY job to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.
2. Update the logic to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The updated code checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length and builds the query accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
