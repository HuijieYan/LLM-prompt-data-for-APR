The issue seems to be with the `copy` function inside the `S3CopyToTable` class. The failing test is due to the `self.columns` variable being `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length using `len(self.columns)`. 

To fix this issue, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ', '.join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) if self.columns else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we use a conditional statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we join the column names using a comma and a space. Otherwise, `colnames` remains an empty string.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and handle scenarios where `self.columns` is `None`.
