Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to call _credentials() and copy_options() functions without instantiating them as methods of the current class.

Bug's cause: The buggy function is attempting to call _credentials() and copy_options() as methods of the current class, but they are defined as separate functions. This results in a AttributeError because they are not defined within the scope of the current class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define _credentials() and copy_options() as methods of the current class.
2. Update the references to _credentials() and copy_options() to use self._credentials() and self.copy_options() respectively.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # calling as a class method
        options=self.copy_options())  # calling as a class method
    )
```

By making the changes above, the _credentials() and copy_options() functions are now being called as methods of the current class, resolving the AttributeError issue.
