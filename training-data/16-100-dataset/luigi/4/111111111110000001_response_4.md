1. The problematic function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It is failing because it is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute, which is currently set to `None`, causing a `TypeError`. This function is called by the `run` method in the test file `redshift_test.py`.

2. The potential error location is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` function.

3. The bug is caused by the `columns` attribute being `None` and the function attempting to check its length. This is evident from the failing test message, which shows that `columns` is being set to `null` and then the `len` function is being called on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. One approach to fixing the bug would be to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get the length of it. Additionally, the `colnames` variable can be assigned as an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, `colnames` will be assigned as an empty string. This corrected code satisfies the failing test and should fix the bug.
