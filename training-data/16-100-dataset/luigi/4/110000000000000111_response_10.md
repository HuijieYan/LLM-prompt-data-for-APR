1. The buggy function is a method for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The issue on GitHub indicates that when the 'columns' parameter is set to None, the Redshift COPY job fails in luigi 2.7.1. The potential cause of the bug may be related to the handling of the 'columns' parameter in the 'copy' function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line is trying to check the length of the 'columns' parameter, but if 'columns' is set to None, then this line will raise a TypeError.

3. (a). The buggy function is trying to construct a COPY command for Redshift, but it doesn't handle the case where 'columns' is None.
   (b). The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when 'columns' is set to None, which results in a TypeError due to the attempt to find the length of None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if 'self.columns' is not None before trying to find its length.
   - Use a default value for 'colnames' if 'self.columns' is None.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if 'self.columns' is not None before finding its length. This will prevent the TypeError when 'columns' is set to None.
