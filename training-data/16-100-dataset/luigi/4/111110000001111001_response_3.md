The potential error location within the problematic function is the formatting of the SQL query in the cursor.execute() method. The options attribute is being passed as a function reference (self.copy_options) instead of calling the function to get its return value.

The bug's cause is the incorrect handling of the copy_options method, which should be called to get its return value and then included in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to call the copy_options method to get its return value and include it in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now properly call the copy_options method and include its return value in the SQL query, resolving the bug and producing the expected output for the given input parameters.
