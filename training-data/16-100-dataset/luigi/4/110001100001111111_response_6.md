Potential error location: The potential error is occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` because it is assuming that `self.columns` always has a value, leading to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Bug's cause:
The `copy` function is assuming that `self.columns` is always provided, and it is constructing `colnames` using it without checking for None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length.
2. If self.columns is None, set colnames to an empty string.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code checks if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`, and sets `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is None. This approach resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by handling the case when `self.columns` is None.
