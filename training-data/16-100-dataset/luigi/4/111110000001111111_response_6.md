The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement that checks the length of self.columns. 

The bug's cause is that the buggy function does not handle the case where self.columns is None, leading to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if statement to also check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code handles the case where self.columns is None by first checking if it's not None before attempting to get its length. This should fix the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
