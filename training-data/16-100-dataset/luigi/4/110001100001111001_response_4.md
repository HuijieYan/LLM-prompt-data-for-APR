Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function is the call to self._credentials() and self.copy_options without invoking them as methods.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the _credentials and copy_options functions as methods of the class. As a result, they are not returning the expected values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the _credentials and copy_options functions as methods of the class by using self._credentials() and self.copy_options().

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function will call _credentials and copy_options as methods of the class, and the bug should be fixed.
