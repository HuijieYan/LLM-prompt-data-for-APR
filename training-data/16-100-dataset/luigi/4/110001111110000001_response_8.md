1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to use the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is actually defined. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `NoneType`.

2. The potential error is located in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the class `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is None, and the function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to determine the length of `NoneType`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to use its length.
   - Providing a default value for `self.columns` if it is None.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before using its length
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before using its length, we ensure that the code won't attempt to use the length of a `NoneType` and will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.
