Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is in the line where the `COPY` command is being executed using the `cursor.execute` method. There are some issues with the string formatting and passing the `copy_options` correctly.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect usage of string formatting and passing of the `copy_options` variable. Also, the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` methods are not being called properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` method to correctly use the values of `colnames`, `table`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
2. Call the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` methods to get their actual values.

Corrected Code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With the corrected code, the `COPY` command will be executed with the correct formatting, and the methods `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()` will be called to get their actual values. This will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected.
