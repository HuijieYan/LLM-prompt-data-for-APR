There are a couple of issues in the buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable`.

1. The `copy` function is missing the `self` parameter in the argument list, which is necessary for accessing the class attributes.
2. In the `cursor.execute` call, `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()` since `copy_options` is a method that needs to be called.

The bug causes the `copy` function to not execute the `COPY` command properly, leading to potential errors when trying to copy data from s3 into Redshift.

To fix the bug, the `self` parameter needs to be added to the `copy` function's argument list, and the `copy_options` method needs to be invoked with `()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
