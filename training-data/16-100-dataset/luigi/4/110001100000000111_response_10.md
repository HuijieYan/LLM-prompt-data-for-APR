The potential error location within the problematic function is this line:
if len(self.columns) > 0:

The bug's cause is due to the use of len(self.columns) without checking if self.columns is not None. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before checking its length. We can also update the line to use a more Pythonic way to check if the list is not empty.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With these updates, the bug should be fixed and the Redshift COPY operation should work as expected, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub ticket.
