Potential error location:
The potential error is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` as it appears that `self.columns` might be None causing a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

Bug's cause:
The bug occurs due to the check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This results in a TypeError when `self.columns` is None, as seen in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Use Python's truthiness to check if `self.columns` is not empty.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected code modifies the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This change ensures that the function does not attempt to get the length of a NoneType object, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
