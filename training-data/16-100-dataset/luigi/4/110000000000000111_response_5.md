1. The buggy function is a method for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug appears to be related to the handling of column names when they are not provided. The GitHub issue suggests that when columns are set to None to prohibit table creation, the function fails with a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition check for the length of self.columns. 

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to construct a query for copying data to Redshift, including the column names if they are provided.
   (b). The GitHub issue points out that when self.columns is set to None, it leads to a TypeError because the length of None cannot be checked using len().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the condition check for the length of self.columns to handle the case when it is set to None.
   (b). Use a conditional check to ensure that when self.columns is None, it does not attempt to construct the colnames variable.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the condition check for the length of self.columns has been updated to handle the case when it is set to None. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
