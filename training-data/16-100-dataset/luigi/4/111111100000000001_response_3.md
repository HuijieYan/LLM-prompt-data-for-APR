Potential error location: 
The potential error in the buggy function is in the cursor.execute() method where it is trying to call self.copy_options as a function without parentheses, which would result in an error.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of self.copy_options as a function call without parentheses in the cursor.execute() method. This results in a syntax error and the function call does not execute properly. 

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the self.copy_options function with parentheses in the cursor.execute() method.

Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    # other functions and attributes

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials is provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
