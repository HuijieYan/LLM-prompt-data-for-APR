Potential error location: The error is occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` function.

Bug Cause:
(a). The `copy` function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.
(b). The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class appears to be a subclass of `S3CopyToTable` and does not provide any columns, which results in `self.columns` being None.
(c). The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None.
(d). The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is verifying the behavior of the function when `self.columns` is None and is expecting it to run without error.

Suggested Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length in the `copy` function.
2. Update the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where it is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code:
(a). Handles the case where `self.columns` is None by explicitly checking if it is not None before checking its length.
(b). Will pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
(c). Resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
