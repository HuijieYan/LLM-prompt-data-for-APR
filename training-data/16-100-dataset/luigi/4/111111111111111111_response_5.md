The bug is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error is caused by the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a `TypeError`. 

The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are not directly related to the bug. The failing test is checking the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`, and the error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 338 in the `copy` function.

The GitHub issue suggests changing the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` by first checking if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.

To fix the bug, the conditional check in the `copy` function needs to be updated as per the suggestion in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated conditional check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `TypeError` should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test. This also aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue, resolving the reported bug.
