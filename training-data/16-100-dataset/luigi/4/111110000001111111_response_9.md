The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `copy` function, specifically in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The bug cause is that the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" describes a similar issue, where running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to `None` results in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Provide a default empty list for `self.columns` if it is not already set.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
