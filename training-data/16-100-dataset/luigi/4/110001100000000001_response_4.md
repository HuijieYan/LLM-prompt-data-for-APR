The potential error in the buggy function is in the formatting of the SQL query inside the cursor.execute() method. The problem lies in how the _credentials() and copy_options() functions are called within the string formatting, and also missing parenthesis for the copy_options() function.

The bug's cause is that the self._credentials() and self.copy_options are not being called as methods, and the copy_options function is missing the parenthesis.

To fix the bug, the _credentials and copy_options functions should be called as methods by adding parentheses after their names, and the copy_options function call should be corrected by adding parentheses after its name.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
By modifying the function to call the _credentials and copy_options functions as methods and adding parentheses to the copy_options function call, the bug is fixed.
