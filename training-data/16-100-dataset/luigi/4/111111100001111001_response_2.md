The potential error in the buggy function is the way the `copy_options` function is being called. Instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`, it is being referenced without the parentheses as `self.copy_options`. This will not result in the execution of the function and will instead return the function object itself, leading to a TypeError when trying to format it in the query.

To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function should be called with parentheses.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` with parentheses, we ensure that the function is executed and its return value is used in the query, which should fix the TypeError that was occurring.
