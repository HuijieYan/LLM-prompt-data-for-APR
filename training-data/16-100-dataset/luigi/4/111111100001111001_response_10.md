The potential error in the buggy function is with the `copy_options` attribute. It is being called as a function without parentheses, causing the code to fail.

The bug's cause is the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` attribute, which should be called as a function with parentheses to return the actual options, but is currently being used without parentheses causing a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` attribute as a function with parentheses to return the options.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed the call to copy_options
    )
```
