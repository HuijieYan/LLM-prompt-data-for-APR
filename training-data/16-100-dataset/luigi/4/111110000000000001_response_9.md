The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `self.copy_options` without the parentheses to actually call the `copy_options` function. This means that the `options` parameter is not being correctly populated with the result of the `copy_options` function.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and use its result to populate the `options` parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # (Previous class contents remain the same)
    
    # the buggy function with the bug fixed
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # corrected the usage of copy_options
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `copy_options` function is properly called with `self.copy_options()`, and its result is used to populate the `options` parameter.
