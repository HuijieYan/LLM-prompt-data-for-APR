The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to check the length of a NoneType object, which is why it's causing a TypeError.

The buggy function is `def copy(self, cursor, f)`. It is part of the class `S3CopyToTable`, which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`. The function uses the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions from the same file but different classes.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `copy` function with `columns` as `None`, and it's expecting a particular `execute` call on the `cursor` object.

To fix the bug, we can update the if statement in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length. If it's None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the function will now handle the case where `columns` is `None`, and the test should pass successfully.
