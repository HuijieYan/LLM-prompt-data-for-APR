The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This condition assumes that `self.columns` is always a list with at least one item, leading to the error when `self.columns` is None.

The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` always has a length greater than 0. This assumption leads to an error when `self.columns` is None because `NoneType` does not have a length. The GitHub issue also suggests that the bug is related to the behavior of `self.columns` when it is None.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This will first check if `self.columns` is not None, and then check its length if it exists. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, thus resolving the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.
