Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
if len(self.columns) > 0:

Bug's cause:
The bug's cause is that when no columns are provided (i.e., self.columns is None), the code attempts to call len() on a NoneType, which results in the TypeError.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length.
2. If self.columns is None, skip the processing related to columns.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The corrected code checks if self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length, and processes colnames only if self.columns is not None. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
