The bug in the provided code is due to the way the `copy` function is checking for the length of the `self.columns` attribute. The error message indicates that the `self.columns` is of type None and a TypeError is raised when trying to check its length.

The failing test is specifically testing the case when `columns` is None, and it confirms that in this case, the function is raising a TypeError due to the `len(self.columns)` check.

The GitHub issue also mentions the same problem, and it suggests a potential solution by changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, thereby resolving the TypeError issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue by properly handling the case when `columns` is None.
