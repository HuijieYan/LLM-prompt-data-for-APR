1. The buggy function is a part of the luigi library and is used for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The GitHub issue is related to a bug in luigi 2.7.1 where Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   This line is trying to check the length of self.columns, which is causing the TypeError when self.columns is None.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is trying to compute the length of self.columns without checking if it's None or not.
   (b). The GitHub issue further explains that the issue arises when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None to prohibit table creation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check if self.columns is not None before computing its length.
   (b). Update the code to handle the case where columns are not provided.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected code, we have added a check for self.columns to ensure it's not None before computing its length. This fixes the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
