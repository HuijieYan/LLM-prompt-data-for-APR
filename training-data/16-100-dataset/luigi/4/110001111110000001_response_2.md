1. The buggy function is `copy` in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. This function is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The related functions mentioned in the code are `_credentials` and `copy_options`, which are not shown in the given code snippet but are mentioned as being called by the `copy` function. The failing test is in the `test/contrib/redshift_test` module and is testing the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is when it checks the length of `self.columns`. Since the `columns` parameter is passing as `None`, trying to check the length of `None` causes the `TypeError` that is mentioned in the error message.

3. (a). The buggy function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` could be `None`.
   (b). The related functions are not specifically mentioned, but based on the content of the code, they seem to be providing credentials and copy options for the Redshift target.
   (c). The failing test attempts to run the S3 copy with nonetype columns, and the error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurs when trying to get the length of `NoneType`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `copy` function to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`, possibly by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
   - Add a default value for `self.columns` if it is not provided to avoid the `TypeError`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. Additionally, the call to `self.copy_options` has been updated to `self.copy_options()` to indicate that it's a function call. This should address the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `NoneType`.
