The bug in the given function is that the `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` are being called as methods, but they are actually defined as functions in the same file. Also, the `COPY` command is missing the `FROM` keyword.

To fix the bug, we need to call the functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` and include the `FROM` keyword in the `COPY` command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=_credentials(self),
        options=copy_options(self))
    )
```

With this fix, the function will correctly call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions and include the `FROM` keyword in the `COPY` command.

This should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
