# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if columns is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={key};aws_secret_access_key={secret}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        key=self._credentials().access_key,  # Accessing the access_key from the credentials
        secret=self._credentials().secret_key,  # Accessing the secret_key from the credentials
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- I modified the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition to `if self.columns`, which is a more pythonic way to check if a list is not empty.
- I added `self.columns` as a condition in the `if` statement to ensure that the `colnames` variable is only populated when there are columns.
- I changed `creds=self._credentials()` to `key=self._credentials().access_key` and `secret=self._credentials().secret_key` to correctly access the `access_key` and `secret_key` from the credentials.
- I also changed `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function.

These changes should address the buggy behavior and ensure that the function operates as intended.
