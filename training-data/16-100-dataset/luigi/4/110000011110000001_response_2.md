1. The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `Redshift` luigi module. The function is responsible for defining the copying from S3 into Redshift. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior of the `copy` method when the `columns` argument is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` method is the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. It tries to check the length of the `columns` attribute, and it is assumed that `self.columns` is supposed to be a list or another iterable, but in the failing test, `columns` is explicitly set to `None`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `copy` method is assuming `self.columns` is always an iterable, but it is not handling the case when it is `None`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
   - Handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With the corrected code, the `copy` method will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and will no longer throw a `TypeError`. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
