The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The issue from the GitHub report suggests that this might be causing an error when `self.columns` is None.

The bug's cause appears to be that the code does not properly handle cases when `self.columns` is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, the code can be modified to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. If it is None, then `colnames` should be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `if` statement now checks if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding with getting its length. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided.
