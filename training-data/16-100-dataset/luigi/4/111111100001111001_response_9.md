The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. However, there are a few issues with the function:

1. The `colnames` variable is being constructed incorrectly. It should be wrapped in parentheses, but the code is not handling this correctly.

2. The `creds` and `options` variables are not being called correctly. They are methods, but they should be called using `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options()`.

3. The `options` variable is not being used correctly. It should be called as a method, but it's being treated as a property.

To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable should be properly constructed with parentheses, the `creds` and `options` variables should be called as methods, and the `options` variable should be used as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With these changes, the function should now properly construct the SQL `COPY` command and execute it with the correct variables.
