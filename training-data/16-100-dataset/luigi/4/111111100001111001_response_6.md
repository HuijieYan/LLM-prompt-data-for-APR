The potential error location within the problematic function is the `creds=self._credentials()` line. The bug's cause is that the `_credentials` function is not being called correctly and it is missing parentheses to indicate a method call.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `_credentials` function in the correct way and also ensure that the `copy_options` function is also being called correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),  # fixed line
        options=self.copy_options())  # fixed line
    )
```

By calling the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions using parentheses, we ensure that they are being executed as methods and their returned values are being correctly passed into the `cursor.execute` statement. These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the provided input/output variable information.
