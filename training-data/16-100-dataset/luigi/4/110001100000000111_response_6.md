1. The buggy function `copy` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is a method of a class that is responsible for defining the copying from S3 into Redshift. It utilizes the `_credentials` and `copy_options` methods from the same file and has a dependency on the `columns` attribute of the class as referenced by `self.columns`.

The related GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes the Redshift COPY job to fail when the `columns` attribute is set as None.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the following condition:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```

3.  The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:

(a). The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of the `columns` attribute, which leads to the TypeError when the `columns` attribute is set as None.
(b). The related function `_credentials` and `copy_options` are used within the `copy` function, but they do not directly contribute to the bug.
(c). The GitHub issue information confirms that the bug causes the Redshift COPY job to fail when `columns` is set as None, and proposes a solution to check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists and then if it has a length greater than 0.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` is updated to first check if `self.columns` exists before proceeding with the length check. This change ensures that the Redshift COPY job does not fail when the `columns` attribute is set as None.
