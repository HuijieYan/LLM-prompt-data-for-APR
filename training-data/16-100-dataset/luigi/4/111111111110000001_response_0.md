1. The problematic function is `copy()` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This function is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift, but it is causing a `TypeError` due to a comparison with the `NoneType` object. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`, and it's failing with a `TypeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is not being properly handled when it's `None`. The function is trying to compare the length of `None` using `len()` which is causing the `TypeError`. The failing test is testing this scenario and the error message indicates the location of the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before comparing its length, and providing a fallback behavior if it is `None`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The corrected code includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compare its length. Additionally, the call to `self.copy_options` is corrected by adding parentheses to call the function. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
