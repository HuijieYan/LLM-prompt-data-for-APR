The buggy function needs to be fixed by adding a condition to check if the `self.columns` attribute is not None before trying to access its length. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # .... Other parts of the class ....

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The correction includes adding a check for `self.columns` to avoid trying to access its length when it's None. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` method needs to be called with parentheses at the end to execute the method and get its return value.
