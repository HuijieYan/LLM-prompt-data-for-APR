1. The buggy function is a method named copy within a class, and it is used for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue on GitHub indicates that when the columns parameter is set to None to prohibit table creation, the Redshift COPY job fails in Luigi 2.7.1.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checking for the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, then the code will result in a TypeError when trying to obtain the length of None.

3. The bug's cause is that when the columns parameter is set to None, the buggy function does not handle the case properly, leading to a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking if self.columns is not None before trying to obtain its length, and providing a default value for colnames if self.columns is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    if self.columns is None:  # handle the case when columns is None
        colnames = ''  # provide a default value if columns is None

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By adding the conditional check for self.columns and providing a default value for colnames if self.columns is None, the corrected function should now handle the case when columns is set to None, and it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
