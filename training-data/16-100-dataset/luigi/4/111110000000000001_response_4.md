1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the class `S3CopyToTable`, which is a subclass of `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the `cursor.execute` block, where it's trying to execute a query to copy data from S3 to Redshift.

3. The bug's cause is due to the following reasons:
   (a) In the `cursor.execute` block, the `options` parameter is not being called as a function.
   (b) The `options` parameter should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.

4. To fix the bug, the `options` parameter needs to be called as a function by appending parentheses to `self.copy_options`.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `self.copy_options()` function will be called appropriately, and the bug should be resolved.
