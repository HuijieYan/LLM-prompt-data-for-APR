The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` because it does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length, which leads to the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This is reflected in the GitHub issue where the user mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails with a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change will first check if `self.columns` is not None before evaluating its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
