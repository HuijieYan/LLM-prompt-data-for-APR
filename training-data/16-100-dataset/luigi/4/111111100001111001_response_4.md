Potential error location: The bug is likely in the line `options=self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement. 

Bug's cause: The `copy_options` method is being called incorrectly. It should be called using `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to execute the method and retrieve its return value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` method using `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the return value and provide it as an argument in the `cursor.execute` statement.
2. Ensure that the `colnames` and other variables are correctly formatted and contain the expected values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` method is correctly called using `self.copy_options()` to provide its return value as an argument in the `cursor.execute` statement.
