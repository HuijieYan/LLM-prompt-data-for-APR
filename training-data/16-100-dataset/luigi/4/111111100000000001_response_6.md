The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `self.copy_options` without calling the method `copy_options(self)`.

The bug's cause is that the `copy` function is trying to use `copy_options` as an attribute of the class rather than calling it as a method.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options(self)` method and also ensure that it returns the correct value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `copy_options(self)` method has been properly called within the `cursor.execute()` function to retrieve the correct value.
