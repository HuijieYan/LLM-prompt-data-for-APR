The bug was fixed by adding a check for the existence of self.columns before trying to get its length in the `copy` function. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The fixed version ensures that the `if` condition is true only when `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than 0, addressing the issue where the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` was being raised.
