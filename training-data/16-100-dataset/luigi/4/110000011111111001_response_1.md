The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is occurring because the `self.columns` parameter is `None` and the function does not handle this case.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`. When the `run` method is called, it invokes the `copy` method with the `cursor` and `f` parameters. Inside the `copy` method, it tries to get the length of `self.columns`, which causes a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` method will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, and the `TypeError` should be resolved. This corrected code should pass the failing test and work as expected.
