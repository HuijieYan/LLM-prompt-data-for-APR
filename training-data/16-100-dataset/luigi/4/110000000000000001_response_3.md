1. The buggy function is a method called "copy" with three parameters (self, cursor, f). It is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The function uses string formatting to construct the SQL query for the COPY command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the cursor.execute() block. There is a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() statement.

3. The bug's cause is the missing closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() statement, which leads to a syntax error.

4. To fix the bug, the missing closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() statement needs to be added.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
        )
    )
```
