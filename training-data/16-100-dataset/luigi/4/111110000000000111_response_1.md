1. The buggy function `copy` is a method within the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a subclass of both `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`. The GitHub issue indicates that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 due to a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to execute a Redshift COPY command, but it's failing due to a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's not None.
   (b). The `S3CopyToTable` class is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3. It contains the buggy function `copy` which defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
   (c). The GitHub issue information states that the root cause of the issue is a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). The issue arises when `columns = None` is used to prohibit table creation, and the proposed solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length.
   - Update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the TypeError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, an additional check `if self.columns:` is added before attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. This ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it's not None, thereby avoiding the TypeError.
