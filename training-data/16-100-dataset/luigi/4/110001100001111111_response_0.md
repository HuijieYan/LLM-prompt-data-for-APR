The bug is located in the if statement where it checks for the length of self.columns. The issue arises when self.columns is None, which leads to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

The GitHub issue suggests that the problem occurs when columns are not provided. The suggested solution is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we will modify the if statement to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when columns are not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will not attempt to get the length of None when columns are not provided, thus resolving the TypeError. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report.
