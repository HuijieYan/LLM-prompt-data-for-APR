It seems that the issue lies in the way the partition is being handled in the `table_exists` function. It is trying to use the `partition_spec` function and construct the query string, but it is not doing so correctly, which leads to incorrect stdout.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to construct the query string for the partition properly and handle it in the else part of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = '/'.join(['{}={}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        query = """use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string})""".format(
            database=database, table=table, partition_string=partition_string)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct output for the given input parameters and satisfy the expected input/output variable information for all the test cases.
