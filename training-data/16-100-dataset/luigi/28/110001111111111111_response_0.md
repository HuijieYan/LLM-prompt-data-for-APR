The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, leading to failing tests when the table name is provided in a different case than it is stored in Hive.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the function not considering the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for their existence in the Hive database.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the Hive database.
2. Update the related test functions to include cases with different table name cases to ensure the function handles case sensitivity appropriately.
3. Consider updating the other related functions mentioned in the GitHub issue to handle case insensitivity consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()  # Compare in lowercase
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)  # No need for separate checks, return the boolean value directly
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post regarding the case insensitivity of table names in the Hive database.
