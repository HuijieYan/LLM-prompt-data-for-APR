The bug is due to the fact that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called directly in the `table_exists` method, instead of being called as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This is likely causing the function to fail, as it may not have the necessary context to execute properly.

To fix the bug, we should call the `run_hive_cmd` function as a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By calling `run_hive_cmd` as `self.run_hive_cmd` within the `HiveCommandClient` class, we ensure that it is being called in the correct context, allowing it to execute properly and fixing the bug.
