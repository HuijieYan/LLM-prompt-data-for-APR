The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition for checking the existence of a table with a partition. In the else block, it is expected to return True when stdout is not empty, and False when stdout is empty. However, the if condition is inverted, which is causing the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to reverse the conditions inside the else block so that it returns True when stdout is not empty, and False when stdout is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if not stdout:
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
