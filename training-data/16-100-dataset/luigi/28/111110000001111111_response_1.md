Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function lies in the comparison between the table name and the stdout. The comparison is case sensitive, causing the function to fail when the table name and the stdout have different cases.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison between the table name and the stdout. Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison should also be case insensitive. As a result, the function fails to identify the table's existence, leading to incorrect return values.

GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the problem and suggests a solution by making the table_exists function case insensitive. The proposed fix is to check the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking the presence of the table in the stdout. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The updated code makes use of lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout to perform a case-insensitive comparison, ensuring that the function behaves correctly for all input cases. This fix satisfies the expected input/output variable information and addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report.
