The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with different parameters based on whether the `partition` parameter is provided or not. Additionally, the `table_exists` function does not correctly handle the case insensitivity of table names.

The bug appears to be in the way the `stdout` variable is being checked for table existence. In the first part of the if-else statement, the `stdout` is checked directly for the table name, while in the second part, the `stdout` is checked for truthiness. This inconsistency might lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, update the `table_exists` function to handle the case insensitivity of table names by converting the table name to lowercase before checking for existence. Additionally, modify the logic to check for table existence based on whether the `partition` parameter is provided or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in tables]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return any(partition.items() <= dict(p.split('=')) for p in stdout.split('\n'))
```

With this updated logic, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check for table existence considering the case insensitivity of table names and the presence of the `partition` parameter. This should address the failing tests and error messages provided.
