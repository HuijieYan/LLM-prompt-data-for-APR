The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case when a partition is specified properly. When a partition is specified, it is using the `run_hive_cmd` function incorrectly and not returning the correct result. This leads to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the case when a partition is specified. We can use an if-else statement to execute different code depending on whether a partition is specified or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k} = '{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})"
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function properly handles the case when a partition is specified and should pass all the failing test cases.
