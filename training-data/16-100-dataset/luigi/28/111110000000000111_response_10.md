1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database, and it also handles the case where a partition is specified. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, the comparison should be case insensitive to avoid issues related to case sensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists.

   (a). The buggy function `table_exists` uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to retrieve table information from Hive.
   
   (b). The `HiveCommandClient` class is a subclass of `HiveClient` and it contains the `table_exists` function.
   
   (c). The GitHub issue provides information about the case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence, and suggests that this could be fixed by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive.
   - Implement a case insensitive comparison using the Python `lower()` function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_value = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});""".format(database, table, partition_value))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code uses the `lower()` function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase for a case insensitive comparison. This change addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive.
