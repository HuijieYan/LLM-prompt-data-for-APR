The issue with the buggy function is that the 'table_exists' function does not correctly handle the case when a partition is not None. The function incorrectly constructs the hive command in this case, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the 'table_exists' function to handle the case when a partition is not None properly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = " and ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

With this fix, the 'table_exists' function will construct the hive command for partitions correctly and check the output to determine if the table exists.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
