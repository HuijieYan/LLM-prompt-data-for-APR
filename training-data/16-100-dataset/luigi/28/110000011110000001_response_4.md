The buggy function is `table_exists` which is being tested by the `test_table_exists` test function. The error message indicates that the test is failing because it expects `self.assertTrue(returned)` but is receiving `False is not true`. This discrepancy suggests that the `table_exists` function is returning incorrect values.

The potential error location in the `table_exists` function is the conditional statements where it checks the value of `stdout`. The logic seems to be faulty in determining whether the table exists or not, especially when handling partitions.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not correctly processing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and determining whether the table or partition exists.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from `run_hive_cmd` and then checks whether the table or partition exists. Additionally, the function should be modified to return `True` when the table/partition exists and `False` when it does not, rather than relying on the content of the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the table and partition existence checks and pass the failing test.
