1. The buggy function table_exists in the class HiveCommandClient is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a given database, with an option to specify a partition. The bug relates to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The related functions are run_hive_cmd and partition_spec, which are called within the buggy function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the stdout returned by the run_hive_cmd function when partition is None.

3. The bug is caused by the lack of case insensitivity in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. The issue on GitHub suggests that tables defined as capitalized names are returned in lowercase by Hive, causing the comparison to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the lower() method on both the table name and the stdout to make both strings lowercase before comparison.
   - Modify the comparison logic to use case-insensitive comparison methods.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison logic has been updated to use the lower() method to make both the table name and the stdout lowercase before comparison. This change makes the comparison case insensitive and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
