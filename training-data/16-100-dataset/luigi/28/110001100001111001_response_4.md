The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to the incorrect condition for checking the presence of the table in the Hive. The function should return `True` if the table is found in the Hive and `False` if it is not found. However, the current implementation returns the output of `run_hive_cmd` directly, which does not accurately represent the existence of the table.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
