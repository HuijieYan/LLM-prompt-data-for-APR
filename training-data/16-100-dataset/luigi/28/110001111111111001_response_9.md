The potential error in the code is within the `table_exists` function. The issue lies in the `if partition is None` condition, as it does not call the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. Additionally, the second part of the function that deals with partitions seems to be partially correct, but the `stdout` check is incorrect.

The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function is not correctly utilizing the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for table existence and partition existence. This is leading to incorrect return values and failing tests.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Correctly calling the `run_hive_cmd` function for both cases (with and without partition) in the `table_exists` function.
2. Adding the correct condition to check the existence of partitions and return the correct Boolean value.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
