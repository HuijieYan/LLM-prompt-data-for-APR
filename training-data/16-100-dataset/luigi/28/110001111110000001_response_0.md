1. Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check whether a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition.

The failing test indicates that the function is not returning the expected result, leading to an assertion error. The failing test provides examples where the function should return `True` but it returns `False`.

2. Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statement that checks for the existence of a partition. It seems that the logic inside the conditional statement might not be functioning as expected.

3. Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function `table_exists` is not properly handling the logic for checking the existence of a table with a partition.
(b) The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are being called within the buggy function, but it seems the interaction with these functions in the conditional statements is not providing the correct results.
(c) The failing test and error message clearly indicate that the function is not returning the expected results for certain test cases and partitions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the conditional statement for checking the existence of a partition is correctly implemented. This might involve reviewing the logic for calling the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition_string = ', '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_string))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional statement for handling the partition has been updated to properly construct the partition specification.
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct parameters based on whether the partition is a dictionary or a string.
- The `bool` function is used to explicitly convert the output of `run_hive_cmd` to a boolean value, ensuring that `True` or `False` is returned as expected.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
