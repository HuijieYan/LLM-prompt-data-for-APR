The issue with the buggy function lies in the if-else condition. In the first branch, the function checks if the stdout is not empty and if the table exists in the stdout, which is correctly implemented. However, in the else branch, the function checks if stdout exists, and if not, it returns False, which is incorrect.

The bug's cause is:
(a). The buggy function has an if-else condition that incorrectly handles the stdout variable.
(b). The failing test and error message show that the expected output is not being met due to the incorrect logic in the else branch.
(c). Discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are due to the incorrect implementation of the else branch.

To fix the bug, the else branch needs to be modified to return False only if the table does not exist in the specified partition.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if partition in stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
