1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient`. It contains a conditional statement to handle the case where the `partition` parameter is not None. In this case, it calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with a formatted string, but the `partition_spec` function is called incorrectly.

2. The potential error location is in the `else` block of the conditional statement, where `run_hive_cmd` is called with a formatted string that includes a call to `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

3. (a) The buggy function incorrectly calls the `self.partition_spec` function. 
   (b) The class `HiveCommandClient` contains the buggy function and other related functions like `partition_spec` and `run_hive_cmd`.
   (c) The `partition_spec` function exists in the same file but is not the same class, and the `run_hive_cmd` function is also defined in the same file.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the  `partition_spec` function is called correctly within the `table_exists` function, and that its result is properly passed to `run_hive_cmd`. We also need to handle any potential errors in the `run_hive_cmd` function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of the partition_spec function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we properly format the `partition_str` that is then used in the `run_hive_cmd` call. We also handle the `stdout` result before returning a boolean value. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is not called within the `table_exists` function.
