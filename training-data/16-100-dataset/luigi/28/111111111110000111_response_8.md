The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This causes the test to fail when checking for the existence of a table with a different case.

The issue is related to the `table_exists` function and how it compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The failing test indicates that when checking for the existence of a table with a different case, the function does not return the expected result.

The GitHub issue posted about this bug suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post about case insensitivity.
