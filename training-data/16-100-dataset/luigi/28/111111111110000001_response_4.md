The bug is likely within the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The error message asserts that `False is not true` when the function is called with the table name "MyTable" which should return true. This suggests that the condition for case insensitivity is not working properly.

The bug's cause could be that the condition for case insensitivity is not being handled correctly within the `table_exists` function. The function seems to be checking the table name without considering the case of the characters.

To fix the bug, the condition for case insensitivity should be handled properly in the `table_exists` function. Additionally, the function should properly handle the check for the presence of a table in stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code handles the case insensitivity for the table name comparison and properly checks if the table exists in the stdout. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
