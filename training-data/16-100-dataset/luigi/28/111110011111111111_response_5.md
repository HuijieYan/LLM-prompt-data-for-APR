The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail, as they expect the function to be case-insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the result from the Hive command, without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, as expected by the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the function will now check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, satisfying the expectations of the failing test cases. Additionally, this fix also resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
