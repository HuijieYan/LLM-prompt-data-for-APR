The bug is originating from the `table_exists` function, specifically from how it checks the table name case-insensitively. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout but doesn't account for the case difference between the input table name and the table name in stdout.

The actual input/output variable information shows that the function is not accounting for the case sensitivity, leading to failed tests when the table name case does not match exactly with the stdout.

The GitHub issue mentions the discrepancy between table names being capitalized in the code but returned as lowercase by hive. The suggested fix is to check the stdout against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by comparing the lowercase table name with the lowercase stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function will now compare the lowercase table name with the lowercase stdout, making it case insensitive. This corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output scenarios provided and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
