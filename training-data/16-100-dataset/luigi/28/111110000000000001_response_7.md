1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the class `HiveCommandClient`. It is used to check if a table exists in a specified database. It takes parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`, where `partition` is an optional parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block, where the `run_hive_cmd` command seems to be incorrect.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function attempts to run a Hive command to check for the existence of a table in a database. It first checks if the `partition` parameter is provided, and if so, it runs a Hive command using `run_hive_cmd` to show the partitions for the specified table and partition. However, the command is constructed using incorrect syntax and parameters.

   (b) The buggy class does not provide the implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function, and it also calls a separate function `partition_spec` within the `table_exists` function, which seems to be incomplete.

4. To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` command needs to be constructed correctly, and the `partition_spec` function should be completed to return the partition specification in the expected format.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Correct implementation of the partition_spec function - returning the partition specification
        return partition
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            # Fixed the Hive command to show tables in the specified database
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Constructing the Hive command to show partitions for the specified table and partition
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Returning the boolean value directly, no need for if-else
```

In the corrected code, the syntax of the Hive commands has been fixed, and the `partition_spec` function has been completed to return the partition specification. Additionally, the return statements have been simplified.
