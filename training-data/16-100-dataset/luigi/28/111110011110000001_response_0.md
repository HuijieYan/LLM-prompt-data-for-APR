Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the buggy function is in the conditional statement where the stdout is being checked. It seems that the condition for checking the existence of the table is not being handled correctly when a partition is specified.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the way the function table_exists is handling the partition parameter. When a partition is specified, the function is not constructing the Hive command correctly, leading to incorrect results in the tests.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional statement for checking table existence with a specified partition.
2. Ensure that the Hive command is constructed correctly when a partition is specified.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = ', '.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the conditional statement for checking table existence with a specified partition has been modified to construct the Hive command correctly. This should ensure that the function works as expected and passes the failing test.
