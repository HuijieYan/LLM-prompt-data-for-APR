The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be with the formatting of the `stdout` variable when a partition is provided. The function is not properly formatting the Hive command when a partition is given, which leads to incorrect output.

The failing test is showing that the function is not returning the correct value when checking if a table exists.

To fix the bug, we need to properly format the Hive command when a partition is given. Additionally, we need to modify the code to handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_string = '/'.join([f"{key}={value}" for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_string))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the updated code, we have modified the Hive command to properly check for the existence of tables and partitions. We also added case insensitivity by converting both the table and the output to lowercase before comparing.

With the updated code, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output for all the given cases.
