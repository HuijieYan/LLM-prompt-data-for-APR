The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive. It does not account for the possibility that the table names in the Hive database might be stored in a different case than the one provided. This creates discrepancies between the expected and actual output values, causing the tests to fail.

The GitHub issue also confirms this, suggesting that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to make it case insensitive by comparing the table name in lower case. This can be done by converting the table name to lower case before comparing it with `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function ensures that the table name is converted to lower case before comparing it with `stdout`, making it case insensitive.

By implementing this change, the function now satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
