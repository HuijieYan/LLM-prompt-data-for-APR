The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the table name. This causes the tests to fail when checking for table existence due to case discrepancies.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

The corrected `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function will now compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, which will resolve the failing tests.

With this fix, the function will pass all failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will address the issue posted in GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
