Potential error location: 
The buggy code is the else branch in the table_exists function. The stdout variable is assigned the result of a command to run_hive_cmd, but the command string is not properly formatted, and it is missing the 'partitions' keyword.

Bug's cause:
The buggy code is not properly formatted, and it is missing the 'partitions' keyword in the else branch of the table_exists function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly format the command string in the else branch of the table_exists function.
2. Add the 'partitions' keyword to the command string in the else branch of the table_exists function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```
