Analysis:

The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, and it has an optional `partition` parameter. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` function from the same file. The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are checking the behavior of this function and encountering assertion errors.

The failing test is reporting that for tables with different cases, the function is not behaving as expected. This issue has been reported in the GitHub issue, which suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function is not handling case sensitivity while comparing the table name and the output from the Hive command.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the function to return incorrect results when tables with different case names are checked.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparison to make the comparison case-insensitive.
2. Update the function to use a case-insensitive comparison method to compare the table name and the output from the Hive command.

Corrected Code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code converts both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive. This modification should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
