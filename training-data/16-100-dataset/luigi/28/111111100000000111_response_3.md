1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a part of the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file luigi/contrib/hive.py. It checks if a table exists in a given database and handles cases where a partition is provided. The related function `run_hive_cmd` is used to run hive commands, while the function `partition_spec` is used to define the partition specifications.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" identifies the problem that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive when checking for existing tables in Hive. This means that if the table name is provided in a different case than what is stored in Hive, the function will return incorrect results. The suggested fix is to check the stdout against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is where it checks if the table exists in the stdout returned by the Hive command.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does not perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the returned stdout. This causes incorrect results when the table name is provided in a different case than what is stored in Hive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons.
   - Using the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code performs a case-insensitive comparison for both the table name and the stdout, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread. The `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, using `bool(stdout)` simplifies the return statement.
