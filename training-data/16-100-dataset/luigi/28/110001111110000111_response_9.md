The buggy function is `table_exists` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. It takes in the parameters `table`, `database` and `partition`. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The failing test `test_table_exists` from the file `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is trying to test the `table_exists` function. It uses mock patching to mock the `run_hive_cmd` function and then checks the output of the `table_exists` function. The error message indicates that there are issues with case sensitivity in the function, causing the tests to fail.

The GitHub issue suggests that there are issues with case sensitivity when checking for table existence. It proposes to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name.

The potential error in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. It appears that the comparison is case sensitive, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issues seen in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive, resolving the issues with failing tests and the GitHub issue.
