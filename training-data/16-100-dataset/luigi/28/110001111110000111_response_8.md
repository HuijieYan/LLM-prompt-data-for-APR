After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases. The issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, which is causing the test to fail due to case sensitivity.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the fact that the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering the case. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function returns the correct results.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub ticket.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and ensure that table existence checks in Hive are case-insensitive.
