The buggy function in the HiveCommandClient class is the table_exists function. This function is meant to check if a table exists in a given database, with the option to specify a partition. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not handling case insensitivity properly, causing the assertions to fail.

The root cause of the bug is that the table_exists function is not using case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to use case-insensitive comparison when checking the stdout for the table name.

Here is the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the table_exists function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.

The corrected code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the case insensitivity issue.
