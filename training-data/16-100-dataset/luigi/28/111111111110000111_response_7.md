The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is causing the failing test.

The issue arises from the fact that the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking for table existence. The failing test specifically shows that the function is returning false when it should actually return true due to case insensitivity. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue, which suggests that the function should check `stdout` against a lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

The potential error location is within the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function, where it compares the table name to the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it to the `stdout` and to modify the conditional checks to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout`, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
