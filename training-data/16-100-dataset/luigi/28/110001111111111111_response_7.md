The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table name should be converted to lowercase for comparison with the output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values provided.

Additionally, this fix will also address the issue raised in the GitHub post, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

The updated code should resolve the bug and fulfill the requirements specified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
