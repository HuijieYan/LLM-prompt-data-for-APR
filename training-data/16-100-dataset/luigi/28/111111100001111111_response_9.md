The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name in Hive.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement where stdout is checked for the existence of the table name.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will now compare the table name and the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive manner, thus fixing the bug.

This corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
