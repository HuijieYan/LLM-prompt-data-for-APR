The problematic function is `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. The error message indicates that the function is returning the wrong result for the test case `self.client.table_exists("MyTable")`, where it is expected to return `True` but is returning `False`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `else` branch, where it is using the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `partition_spec` method to construct a command and check if the table exists.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the construction of the command in the `else` branch of the `table_exists` function. It seems like the command being constructed is not correctly checking for the existence of the table in the specified partition.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `else` branch of the `table_exists` function to construct the command properly and check if the table exists in the specified partition.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = ' and '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        cmd = """use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});""".format(database, table, partition_clause)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test.
