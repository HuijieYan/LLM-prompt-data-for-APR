The issue seems to be with the `table_exists` function. It is not handling the case when the table name is provided with different cases (uppercase/lowercase). This is evident from the failing test cases where the function returns False when it should return True due to case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before checking for a match, which makes the comparison case insensitive.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
