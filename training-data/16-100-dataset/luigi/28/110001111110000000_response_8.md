The issue with the table_exists function is that it isn't calling the run_hive_cmd function correctly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the extra semi-colon and formatted the query string properly. Additionally, the return logic has been simplified to directly return the stdout result after checking for its existence. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing tests.
