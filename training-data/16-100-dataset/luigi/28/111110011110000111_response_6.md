The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a given database. The function has two branches, one for when the table has no partition and one for when it has a partition. In the failing test, the issue is that the function is case sensitive, while Hive is case insensitive. This causes the test to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. The comparison is case sensitive, which causes the test to fail when the case of the table name and the output from Hive don't match.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, or utilize Python's `in` operator for case-insensitive searching.

The corrected code for the problematic function can be as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before the comparison. With this correction, the failing test should pass, and it will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
