The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The failing test `test_table_exists` is attempting to verify the functionality of this function. The error message indicates that the test is failing because it expects a table to exist, but the function is returning `False` instead of `True`.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the conditional statements. It seems that the function always returns `False` regardless of whether the table exists or not.

The bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function does not properly handle the conditions that determine if a table exists.
(b). The failing test is not properly verifying the behavior of the `table_exists` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function to correctly determine if a table exists.
2. Update the failing test to properly validate the `table_exists` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine if a table exists in the given database, with or without a specific partition. The provided test should also pass with this corrected code.
