1. The buggy function `table_exists` takes three parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function in different scenarios and is expecting certain outcomes, but the function is not producing the expected results.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional checks and the use of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists.

3. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly determine whether a table exists in the database. The failing test is expecting the correct behavior, but the function is not returning the expected results. This is evident from the error message showing that the assertion of `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing, indicating that the function is not correctly detecting the table.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to ensure they are correctly determining the existence of a table.
   - Ensure that the results from the `run_hive_cmd` function are being processed correctly to determine if the table exists.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- For the case when `partition` is `None`, the function now retrieves all the tables in the database and checks if the specified table is among them to determine if it exists.
- For the case when `partition` is not `None`, the function now directly returns the existence of partitions without any conditional checks.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases provided.
