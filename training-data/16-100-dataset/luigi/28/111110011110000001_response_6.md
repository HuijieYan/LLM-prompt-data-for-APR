Potential error location: The bug may be caused by the incorrect formatting of the string in the else part of the `table_exists` function.

Bug's cause:
(a). Buggy function: The `table_exists` function is not properly handling the partition parameter and constructing the command to check for table existence. The else part is trying to format the string incorrectly to use the `partition_spec` function.

(b). Buggy class: The `table_exists` function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.

(c). Failing test and error message: The failing test is testing the `table_exists` function with different scenarios and asserting the expected results. The error message shows that the test is failing because the function is not returning the expected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly format the else part of the `table_exists` function to construct the command to check for table existence with a partition.

2. Use the `partition_spec` function to correctly build the partition part of the command.

3. Ensure that the function returns the correct results based on the conditions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        return bool(stdout)
```
