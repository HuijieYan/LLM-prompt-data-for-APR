The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way the `stdout` variable is checked for truthiness. The function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which will return False if `stdout` is an empty string, even if `table` is present in it. Similarly, in the case where a partition is provided, the function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise, which is contrary to the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can directly check if the table is in the stdout without relying on the truthiness of the string. We can also simplify the check when a partition is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return stdout != ''
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information for all the provided test cases.
