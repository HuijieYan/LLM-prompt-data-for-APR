The issue seems to be with the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. The buggy function `table_exists` currently does a direct comparison between the table name and the result from the Hive command, which can fail when the case of the table name does not match the case of the result.

To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the result from the Hive command should be made case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the result from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, as expected. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test cases.
