Upon analyzing the buggy function and the provided input/output variable information, along with the GitHub issue, it's evident that the issue arises from the case sensitivity of the table name comparison in the "table_exists" function. The function is not considering the case of the table name when comparing it to the output from the Hive command, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual values of the "stdout" variable.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, where case sensitivity is not being considered.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The "table_exists" function in the buggy code does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual values of the "stdout" variable.
(b) The discrepancies between the expected and actual values of the "stdout" variable stem from the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of the table.

The GitHub issue "hive table_exists should be case insensitive" highlights the problem of case sensitivity in table name comparison and suggests a solution to check the "stdout" against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues. The proposed solution aligns with the identified bug's cause.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.
2. Implementing a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function converts both the table name and the "stdout" to lowercase before comparison, thus making the "table_exists" function case insensitive. This solution aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue.

By implementing the above correction, the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided, successfully resolves the case sensitivity issue, and aligns with the solution proposed in the GitHub issue.
