The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The function should be updated to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This aligns with the reported GitHub issue about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This updated code should resolve the case sensitivity issue and align with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
