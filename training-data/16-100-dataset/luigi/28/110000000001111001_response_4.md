The bug in the function is related to the conditionals. In the first conditional, the function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which means it only returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied. In the second conditional, the function returns `True` if `stdout` exists and `False` otherwise. This means that the function is not consistent in its return values.

The bug is caused because the two conditionals have inconsistent return conditions, leading to unexpected behavior. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both conditionals return values consistently and as expected based on the input parameters.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # returns True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2}""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)  # returns True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

With this correction, the function now returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, and `False` otherwise, consistent with the expected input/output variable information provided.
