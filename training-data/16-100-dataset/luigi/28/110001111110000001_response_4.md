The potential error in the `table_exists` function is in the condition where it checks for the existence of a table in the database. 

The cause of the bug is that when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name in uppercase, it fails to recognize the table and returns `False` instead of `True`. This is evident from the failing test where `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails when the table name is in uppercase.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is case-insensitive when checking for its existence in the database. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the table list from the database to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the table name and the tables listed in the database are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the check for table existence is case-insensitive. This should make the function pass the failing test.
