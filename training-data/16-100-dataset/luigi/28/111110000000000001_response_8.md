1. The buggy function is `table_exists` which is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This function is used to check if a table exists in a specific database and partition.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `else` block where the `stdout` is being assigned a value after running a command.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the else block does not correctly handle the case where the `stdout` is empty. It should return False when `stdout` is empty, but instead it is returning True.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `else` block to check if `stdout` is empty and return False if it is. Additionally, we can combine the two return statements from the `if` and `else` blocks into a single return statement.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```
