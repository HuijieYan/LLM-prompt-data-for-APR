The problematic function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not case-insensitive when comparing the table names. The error message specifically mentions that "False is not true", indicating that the function is returning incorrect results when handling case sensitivity.

The root cause of this bug is that the function is not converting the table names to lowercase before comparison, which is leading to incorrect results in the test cases. This discrepancy is causing the test cases to fail as the actual output does not match the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table names to lowercase before comparing them with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This modification will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and will resolve the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Additionally, the fix will also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue #896, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database.
