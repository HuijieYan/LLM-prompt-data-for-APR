1. The buggy function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which inherits from `HiveClient`. The function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition. The GitHub issue indicates that the function needs to be case insensitive when checking for table existence due to Hive being case insensitive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. This comparison is not accounting for case insensitivity.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This causes issues when the table names are in different cases. The GitHub issue also confirms that the issue is related to case sensitivity and provides a suggested fix for the problem.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition).lower()
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected code modifies the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. Both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison. This change addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
