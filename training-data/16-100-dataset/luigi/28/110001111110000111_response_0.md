The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. This resulted in failing tests and a GitHub issue discussing the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name without considering the case of the table. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of tables.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        lowercase_table = table.lower()
        return stdout and lowercase_table in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        lowercase_table = table.lower()
        if stdout:
            return lowercase_table in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code includes converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, making the comparison case insensitive. This change should make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
