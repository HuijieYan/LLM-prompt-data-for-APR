1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the comparison of table names. The function is not case insensitive, causing issues when checking for table existence with different casing.

3. The cause of the bug is the lack of case insensitivity in the comparison of the table name. The function does not account for the fact that Hive is case insensitive, and therefore, the comparison of table names is not accurate.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison of table names to be case insensitive.
   - Use lower() function to convert table names to lowercase before comparison.
   - Update the function to properly handle case sensitivity during table existence check.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `table_exists`:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Compare table names in a case insensitive manner
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison of table names case insensitive using the `lower()` function, the corrected function resolves the issue posted in the GitHub ticket. This ensures that table existence checks are performed in a case insensitive manner, addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
