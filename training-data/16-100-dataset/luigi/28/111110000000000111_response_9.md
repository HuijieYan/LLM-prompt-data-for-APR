1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method in the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a child class of `HiveClient`. The GitHub issue relates to the case sensitivity of table checks in the Hive database. The issue mentions that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lower case, causing the check for existing tables to fail. The suggested solution is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` without taking case sensitivity into account.

3. The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. The buggy class `HiveCommandClient` is responsible for invoking Hive commands and checking for table existence. The GitHub issue highlights this case sensitivity issue and suggests a solution to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison of table name with the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
   - Use the `lower()` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison.

5. Corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` has been modified to be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` function. This resolves the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
