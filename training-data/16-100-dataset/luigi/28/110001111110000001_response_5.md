The potential error in the `table_exists` function seems to be with the conditional statements. When the `stdout` is empty, the function should return False, but it currently doesn't handle this case correctly.

The buggy function first calls `run_hive_cmd` to get a list of tables. If `partition` is not None, it then calls `run_hive_cmd` again to get a list of partitions and checks if the output is not empty to determine if the table exists.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `stdout` is empty in both the if and else conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By returning `bool(stdout)`, the function will return True if `stdout` is not empty and False if it is empty, which will ensure that the function handles the case when `stdout` is empty. This approach will ensure that the corrected function passes the failing tests.
