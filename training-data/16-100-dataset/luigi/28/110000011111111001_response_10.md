The buggy function `table_exists` has a logic error when checking for the existence of a table in the database. It does not handle the case-insensitive nature of table names in Hive, leading to the failing tests.

The failing tests indicate that the function `table_exists` is not handling the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. In the failing test, it is trying to check for the existence of a table with the name `'MyTable'` when the actual table name is `'mytable'`. This discrepancy is causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to handle case insensitivity of table names in Hive. We can do this by converting the table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the database. This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
