The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failing test `test_table_exists` is checking the functionality of this function, specifically its ability to handle case insensitive comparisons of table names.

The potential error in the problematic function lies in the comparison of table names in the `stdout` with the provided table name. It appears that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to the failing test.

The failing test is producing an error message asserting that a returned value, which should be True, is actually False. This indicates that the comparison between table names is not working as expected and is likely due to case sensitivity.

The GitHub issue further clarifies that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should be updated to perform a case insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function will perform a case insensitive comparison between the table names, addressing the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of a table regardless of case.
