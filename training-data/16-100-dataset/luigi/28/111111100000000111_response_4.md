1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a specified database. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when checking for an existing table, the function fails if the table is defined in capitalized letters because Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
`return stdout and table in stdout`

3. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output in `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. The related functions mentioned in the GitHub issue are the ones that perform the comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.
   - Use the `in` keyword with a case-insensitive comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the table name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
