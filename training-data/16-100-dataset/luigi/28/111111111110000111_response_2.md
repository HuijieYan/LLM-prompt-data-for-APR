The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This leads to the failing test cases in the test file `hive_test.py`.

The issue reported on GitHub also confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, which does not take into account case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the Hive command output, resolving the issue with case sensitivity.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
