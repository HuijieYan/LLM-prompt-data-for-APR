The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table or a partition exists in a given database. The failing test `test_table_exists` is testing this function and is failing with the error message "AssertionError: False is not true."

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking the existence of a table or partition. The logic in the `table_exists` function seems to be incorrect, causing it to return the wrong result.

The bug's cause is that the function's logic does not correctly handle the response from the `run_hive_cmd`. It should return `True` if the table or partition exists and return `False` if it does not exist.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the response from `run_hive_cmd` and return the appropriate boolean value indicating the existence of the table or partition.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected `table_exists` function now correctly checks for the existence of the table or partition based on the response from `run_hive_cmd` and returns the appropriate boolean value. This should make the function pass the failing test.
