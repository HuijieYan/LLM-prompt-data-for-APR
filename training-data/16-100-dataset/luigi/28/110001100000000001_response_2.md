1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in a database, and if a partition is specified, it also checks for the existence of the partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and the `partition_spec` function to construct the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the condition where it checks for the existence of a partition. The usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` is incorrect and may result in a syntax error.

3. The bug's cause is that the `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not being used correctly. The `partition_spec` function is defined as taking only one argument `partition`, but it is being used with `self` as well, which is not compatible with the function signature.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Modify the `partition_spec` function signature to accept `self` as an argument.
   b. Pass `self` as an argument to the `partition_spec` function within the `table_exists` function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(self, partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected code, the `self` is passed as an argument to the `partition_spec` function within the `table_exists` function, and the `partition_spec` function signature now accepts `self` as an argument.
