The bug is caused by the comparison between the table name and the stdout not being case insensitive. This leads to failing tests when the table name in the code and the table name returned from Hive do not match in case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase and then performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests. The comparison between the table name and the stdout is now case insensitive, satisfying the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion regarding case insensitivity.

The corrected code is also included in a GitHub issue to resolve the problem.
