The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the `run_hive_cmd` function without referencing it properly. The `run_hive_cmd` function is defined in the same file but not in the same class, so it needs to be referenced correctly within the `HiveCommandClient` class.

The potential error location is the usage of `run_hive_cmd` directly without proper referencing to its scope within the `HiveCommandClient` class.

To fix the bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be called using the class name `HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd` within the `table_exists` method because it is in the same file but not in the same class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # revised partition_spec method
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = HiveCommandClient.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `run_hive_cmd` function is now being called with the correct scope within the `HiveCommandClient` class, ensuring that it works as expected.
