1. The buggy function 'table_exists' is a method of the 'HiveCommandClient' class, which is a child class of 'HiveClient'. The github issue is related to making the 'table_exists' function case insensitive to address the issue of table names being returned in lowercase from Hive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the 'table' and 'stdout' in the 'if' condition. The comparison is not case insensitive, which leads to the issue described in the GitHub report.

3. The bug cause is due to the inconsistency in case between the table name and the stdout returned by Hive. The 'table_exists' function does not handle this case insensitivity, leading to failed tests when checking for an existing table.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison to be case insensitive when checking for the table existence in the 'stdout'.
   - Use the 'lower()' method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a consistent comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code uses the 'lower()' method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub.
