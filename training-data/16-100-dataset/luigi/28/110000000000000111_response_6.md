1. The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` that checks if the specified table exists in a given database and, optionally, a specified partition. The GitHub issue is related to the fact that the function is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of the table, which causes issues when the table names are defined with different cases.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is with the comparison of the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable.

3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` variables is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the table names have different cases. The GitHub issue suggests that the comparison should be made case-insensitive to resolve this issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Converting both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lowercase before comparing them.
   - Using a case-insensitive comparison method to compare the strings.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive.
- We use the `in` operator to check if the lowercase `table` exists within the lowercase `stdout`.
- We simplified the `if` statement by directly returning the Boolean value of `stdout` in the else block.
