1. The buggy function is called table_exists and it checks whether a table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. It calls the run_hive_cmd function to execute a Hive command and retrieve the output.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check for partition. It is likely that the formatting of the Hive command in the else block is incorrect.

3. The bug's cause is that the else block is incorrectly formatting the Hive command. The call to self.partition_spec(partition) is not formatted properly within the Hive command string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly format the Hive command string in the else block to include the partition spec.
   - Ensure that the Hive command in the else block is properly constructed to show partitions for the specified table and partition.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ' '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
