1. The buggy function `table_exists` is used to check if a table exists in a given database and optionally in a specified partition. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, as Hive is case insensitive and will return table names in lower case regardless of how they are defined.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does a strict comparison between the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable, without considering case sensitivity. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub issue with the example of a table defined as 'FooBar', where the function would fail to correctly identify its existence due to case sensitivity.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison.
   b. Using case-insensitive comparison methods like `lower()` to ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the GitHub issue.
