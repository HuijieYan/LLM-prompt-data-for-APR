The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module, which is being tested by the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` functions in the `hive_test.py` file. The error message indicates that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected results when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. It seems that the comparison is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to failures in the tests.

The cause of the bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The GitHub issue further explains that Hive is case insensitive, and therefore the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive needs to account for this.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report. Specifically, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive has been made case insensitive using the `lower()` method for both strings.
