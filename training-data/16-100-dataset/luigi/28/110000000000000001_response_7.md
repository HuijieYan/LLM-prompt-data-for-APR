1. The buggy function is a method that checks if a table exists in a database. It takes the table name, database name, and an optional partition parameter. It uses the run_hive_cmd function to execute a Hive command and check if the table or partition exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else part of the if-else statement. The code is trying to check if stdout is not empty, but it is not handling the case when stdout is empty correctly.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case when the stdout is empty. The code is checking if stdout is truthy, but it should also explicitly check if it's not empty. Additionally, the code is not properly formatting the Hive command in the else part of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if stdout is not empty in the if-else condition
   - Properly format the Hive command in the else part of the function

5. Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = 'partition ({0})'.format(self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_clause))

        return bool(stdout)
```
