The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive query. The function checks for the table name in the output of a Hive command, but it does so without considering case sensitivity. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" provides insights into this problem. The issue suggests that tables with capitalized names are returned as lowercase by Hive, causing the function to fail. 

To fix this bug, the function can be modified to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function behaves correctly.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for the table name in the Hive output, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post. This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolve the case sensitivity problem as described in the GitHub issue.
