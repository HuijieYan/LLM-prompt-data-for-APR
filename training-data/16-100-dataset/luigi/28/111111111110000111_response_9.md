The buggy function in question is the 'table_exists' function within the HiveCommandClient class in the file luigi/contrib/hive.py. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database, and it seems to have an issue with case sensitivity.

The failing test is checking for table_exists by passing in a table name with different cases ('mytable' and 'MyTable') and is expecting a case-insensitive result. However, the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to a failed assertion in the test.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" describes the same problem, proposing a fix to check the stdout against a lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison statements where the 'table' variable is not being compared in a case-insensitive manner, causing the test to fail when different case variants of the same table name are passed.

To fix the bug, the 'table' variable should be converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison in the function. Additionally, the 'stdout' variable should also be converted to lowercase for consistent comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Since any non-empty string evaluates to True
```

With this correction, the 'table_exists' function should now handle case insensitivity and pass the failing test cases. This fix also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report, as it makes the table existence check case-insensitive.
