1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file is designed to check if a table exists in a database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check the output. The failing test in the `hive_test.py` file is testing this function for different scenarios.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check where it returns `stdout and table in stdout`. This may not be evaluating as expected. 

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the `table in stdout` check not functioning as intended. The failing test indicates that the function is returning the opposite value of what is expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic for the conditional statement in the `table_exists` function to ensure it properly evaluates the presence of the table in the output.
   - Verify the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to see if it includes the expected table name.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with the original function:
- Instead of using `show tables like "{1}"`, it uses `show tables` to get all table names and then checks if the `table` is in the list of tables.
- The `stdout` is split by newline characters, and the presence of the `table` is checked in the list.
- The code for the partition check is simplified, and the return value is directly based on the truthiness of `stdout`. This ensures that the function returns the correct result for both the scenarios mentioned in the failing test.
