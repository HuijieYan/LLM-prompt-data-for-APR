The problem with the function `table_exists` is that it does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The buggy function only checks if the table name exists in the output without considering the case of the table name.

This issue is reflected in all the test cases where the expected output is not matching the actual output due to differences in case sensitivity.

The GitHub issue also reflects this problem, indicating that tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lower case, causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function now compares the table name and the output in a case-insensitive manner, which resolves the issue reported in the GitHub repository and ensures that the function behaves as expected in the given test cases.
