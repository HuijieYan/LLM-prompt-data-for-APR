The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is not comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner while checking if the table exists in the database.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function checks for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner and should resolve the failing test cases as well as the reported GitHub issue.
