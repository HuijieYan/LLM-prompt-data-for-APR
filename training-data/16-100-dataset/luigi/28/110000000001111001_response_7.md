The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checking for the existence of the table. The function does not correctly handle the case where the table is not found in the database.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which leads to incorrect handling of the table existence check.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the output of `run_hive_cmd` to handle the case where the table is not found in the database.
2. Using try-except blocks to catch any exceptions that may occur from querying the database.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        try:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
        except Exception as e:
            return False
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the cases where the table is not found in the database, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
