1. The buggy function is a method called "table_exists" which is part of a larger codebase related to the Spotify Luigi library. The function is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, and how the function should handle this case insensitivity.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the stdout. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive.

3. The bug's cause is that the function currently does a case sensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, which causes issues when table names are defined with different cases. The GitHub issue suggests that the comparison should be case insensitive to avoid these problems.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison
   - Using a case insensitive comparison function
   - Modifying the Hive command to return table names in a consistent case

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now performs a case insensitive check for the existence of the table, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
