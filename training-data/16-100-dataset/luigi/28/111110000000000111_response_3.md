1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which is used to find information using `hive` invocations. The GitHub issue highlights that there is a case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function. It is mentioned that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but hive returns them as lower case which causes the test to fail.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command. The function does not handle the case sensitivity issue and directly compares the table name with the stdout, leading to a potential mismatch due to case differences.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the case sensitivity in the table name comparison. The `table_exists` function does not account for this difference and makes a direct comparison, leading to potential failures when checking for existing tables.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Converting both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase before comparison.
   - Using a case-insensitive comparison method to check for the existence of the table.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
