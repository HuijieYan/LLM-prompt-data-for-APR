The potential error in the problematic function `table_exists` is in the if-else statement handling the partition. When the partition is not None, the function calls `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the returned value is truthy or falsy using `if stdout`. However, this logic is incorrect because an empty string would evaluate to falsy, causing the function to return False when it should be returning True. 

To fix the bug, the logic of checking `stdout` needs to be adjusted to account for the possibility of an empty string being a valid output for `run_hive_cmd`.

Additionally, the function `partition_spec` is also called in the buggy function, and its implementation needs to be checked to ensure it produces the correct output that is expected by `run_hive_cmd`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `table_exists` is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({spec})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
