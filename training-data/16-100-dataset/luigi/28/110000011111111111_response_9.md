The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The expected output from the failing tests also suggests that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name.

The failing test shows that when checking for the existence of a table, the function returns False for a table that exists and True for a table that doesn't exist, due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct result for the failing test cases. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post by making the comparison case insensitive.
