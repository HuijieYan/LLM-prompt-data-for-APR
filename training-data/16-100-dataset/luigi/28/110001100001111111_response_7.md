The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle table names in a case-insensitive manner. The function checks if the table name exists by directly comparing it to the output of the Hive command, which might be in a different case than the input table name. This causes the function to incorrectly report whether the table exists.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly. The GitHub issue also confirms that this behavior is causing problems and suggests that the function should check the output against a lowercased version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output of the Hive command. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will compare the table name and the output in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
