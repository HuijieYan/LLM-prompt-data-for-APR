The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the output from the hive command. This causes issues when the table names are defined in a different case than how they are returned by hive, resulting in false negatives for table existence checks.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of the table name with the output from the hive command, without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name with the output from the hive command needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive, this corrected code ensures that the table existence check is not affected by the case of the table name, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
