### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is a method to check if a table exists in a database. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table, leading to failed test cases. The issue seems to stem from how the function handles the partition parameter and also the comparison of table names.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the partition parameter and the comparison of table names. The function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing table names, and the logic for handling partitions is not correct.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Use case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table.
2. Adjust the logic for handling the partition parameter to ensure the correct formation of the `show partitions` command.
3. Refactor the function to separate the logic for handling partitions and table existence checks.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in tables]
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});'.format(database, database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly and form the `show partitions` command properly. This should address the issues identified and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
