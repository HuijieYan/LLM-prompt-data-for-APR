1. The buggy function is a part of the luigi.contrib.hive.py module and is used to check if a table exists in a given database. The GitHub issue is related to making the table_exists function case insensitive, as sometimes tables are defined in capitalized format but returned in lowercase by Hive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the 'table' variable with the 'stdout' variable. It does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table name.

3. The cause of the bug is that the table name comparison is case-sensitive, causing the function to fail when the table name's case does not match exactly with the table name returned by Hive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison to be case insensitive.
   - Ensure that both the table name and the table name returned by Hive are compared in either lowercase or uppercase to avoid case issues.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The code has been modified to make the comparison case insensitive by using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the table name returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison. This resolves the issue raised in the GitHub post and makes the table_exists function case insensitive.
