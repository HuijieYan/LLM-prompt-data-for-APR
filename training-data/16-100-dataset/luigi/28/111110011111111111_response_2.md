The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the `stdout` value returned from the `run_hive_cmd` command. This causes the test cases where the table name case differs from the `stdout` to fail.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout value. This change should resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" provides a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. By implementing the suggested fix, the bug will be resolved.

By making the changes outlined above, the `table_exists` function should now pass all failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
