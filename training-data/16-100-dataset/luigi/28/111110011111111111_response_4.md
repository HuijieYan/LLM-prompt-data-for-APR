The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. As a result, the function is failing when checking for table existence with different case names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and fix the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence, and it will pass the failing test cases. Additionally, this fix also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub repository, making the function more robust and reliable.
