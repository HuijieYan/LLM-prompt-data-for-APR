The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the function to fail when the table name cases do not match exactly.

After analyzing the related GitHub issue, it is clear that the function needs to check `table.lower()` against `stdout.lower()` to avoid case-related issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function by making it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function now compares the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making it case insensitive. This change will resolve the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensure that the function operates correctly in all cases.
