Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and the corresponding error message, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the table names in the `table_exists` function. The failing test is checking for case insensitivity, as indicated in the GitHub issue, but the `table_exists` function does not account for this.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the hive command, as it does not consider case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the stdout from the hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the stdout from the hive command, which should resolve the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
