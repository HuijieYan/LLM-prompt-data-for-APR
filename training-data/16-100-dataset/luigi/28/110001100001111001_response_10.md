The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function without a proper import statement. To fix this, the import statement for the `run_hive_cmd` function should be added at the top of the file. Additionally, there are multiple `partition_spec` functions defined with the same name, which should be resolved.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
1. Add the import statement for the `run_hive_cmd` function at the top of the file.
2. Resolve the multiple `partition_spec` functions with the same name by giving them distinct names or combining them into a single function as per their usage.

The corrected code for the problematic function `table_exists` is as follows:

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Assuming the correct partition_spec function is used here
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `run_hive_cmd` function will be properly imported, and the `table_exists` function will work as expected based on the provided test cases and their expected outcomes.
