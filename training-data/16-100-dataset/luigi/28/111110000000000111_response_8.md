Analysis:
1. The buggy function "table_exists" is a method of the class "HiveCommandClient" which uses hive invocations to find information.
2. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" suggests that the table_exists function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the table name with the contents of stdout, which may cause a case sensitivity issue.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the table name is not being compared with the contents of stdout in a case-insensitive manner, leading to failures when the table name case does not match the case of the output from the hive command.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison of the table name with the content of stdout to be case insensitive.
2. Use the lower() method to convert both the table name and the content of stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected Code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower() # case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected code modifies the comparison in the "table_exists" function to be case insensitive by using the lower() method to convert both the table name and the content of stdout to lowercase before comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
