The buggy function in question is the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class. This function is intended to check if a table exists in the given database. The issue is related to case sensitivity, as the function fails when checking for table existence due to a mismatch in table case.

The failing test `test_table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class is asserting for case-insensitive table existence, but the function does not handle this properly. The error message indicates that the function is returning False instead of True when checking for table existence.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the problem with case sensitivity and proposes a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercase table name.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive checks when determining table existence. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
