The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when comparing the table name with the output of the hive command. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the table name and the output of the hive command. The comparison should be case-insensitive.

The cause of the bug is that the function is doing a direct string comparison without considering the case of the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of the hive command to be case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code includes the modification `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue clearly mentions that the comparison should be case-insensitive and suggests using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to fix the case issues.
