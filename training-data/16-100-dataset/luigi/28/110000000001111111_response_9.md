The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a database and is expected to return True if the table exists and False if it doesn't. However, the function seems to be case-sensitive, causing issues when the input table name is in a different case from what is returned by the `show tables` command in Hive.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and the following detailed description suggest that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence. The issue proposes to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Based on the input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the function is failing to identify the table's existence due to case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` should be case insensitive. The function should check for `table.lower()` in `stdout.lower()` to ensure that case differences do not affect the result of the check.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code makes the comparison case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. It will now return True if the table exists, regardless of the case of the input table name. This fix aligns with the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
