The buggy function is `table_exists` which is used to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. The failing test `test_table_exists` is patching the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the behavior of the `table_exists` function. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the expected results.

The potential error in the function lies in the comparison of the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` with the provided table name, especially for case insensitivity.

The cause of the bug can be understood from the failing test and error message. The test is expecting the function to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The function, however, is not currently designed to handle case insensitivity, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case insensitive.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, as expected in the failing test. This change also aligns with the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

The GitHub issue title "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" and its detailed description are in line with the suggested approach for fixing the bug, which is to make the comparison case insensitive.

By implementing this correction, the function will pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
