1. The buggy function is `table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None)` and it is within the `HiveCommandClient` class. This class is a subclass of `HiveClient` and contains the `partition_spec` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement where partition is not None. The formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` function call within the conditional statement is incorrect and may cause the bug.

3. The bug's cause is that the formatting of the `run_hive_cmd` function call within the conditional statement is incorrect. Additionally, the use of `self.partition_spec(partition)` within the conditional statement is not aligned with the other conditional statement.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly format the `run_hive_cmd` function call within the conditional statement.
   - Ensure that the conditional statement syntax is consistent and correct for the given logic.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
