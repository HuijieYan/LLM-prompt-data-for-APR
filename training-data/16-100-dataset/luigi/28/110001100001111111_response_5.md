The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This results in the function incorrectly returning False even if the table exists but with a different case.

The related GitHub issue also mentions the case sensitivity problem and proposes a fix by checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues, which aligns with our analysis.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the lowercase version of the table name is in the lowercase version of the stdout, making the check case insensitive.

This corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
