1. The buggy function is a method called table_exists which checks if a table exists in a specified database and, optionally, a specified partition.
2. The potential error location is at the if condition where the stdout variable is being checked for truthiness.
3. The bug's cause is that the if condition is not checking for the specific substring 'OK' in the stdout, which indicates that the table exists in the database.
   (a). The buggy function is returning the truthiness of the entire stdout, rather than checking for the specific substring 'OK' to determine if the table exists.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Update the if condition to check for the presence of the substring 'OK' in the stdout to determine if the table exists.
   b. Refactor the function to use a try-except block to handle any errors in the execution of the hive commands.
   c. Check the syntax and usage of run_hive_cmd to ensure it is correctly executing the desired hive commands.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return "OK" in stdout
    else:
        try:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return "OK" in stdout
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            return False
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the if condition to check for the presence of the substring 'OK' in the stdout to determine if the table exists. We also added a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur in the execution of the hive commands, printing out the error message and returning False if an error occurs.
