The buggy function `table_exists` in the `Luigi` package is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function is expected to check if a table exists in the database and used to pass when the table names were in lowercase. However, it started failing when the table names were in camel case. This bug was reported in GitHub issue #896.

The problem originates from the way the function compares the table name against the stdout value returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not consider case sensitivity, causing the tests to fail.

To solve this issue, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout value.

A possible fix for this bug is to modify the comparison to use lowercase for both the table name and the stdout value before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout value, resolving the issue and causing the failing tests to pass.

The corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the GitHub issue #896.
