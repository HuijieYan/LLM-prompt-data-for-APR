The problem in the buggy function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This is causing the test cases to fail when the table name is in a different case from what is returned by Hive.

The buggy function is not performing a case insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This is causing the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name returned by Hive.

The GitHub issue confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function returns the correct results.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from Hive, as per the GitHub issue. This will ensure that the function returns the correct results and resolves the case sensitivity issue.
