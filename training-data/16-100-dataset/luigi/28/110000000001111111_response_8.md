The problem with the buggy function lies in the fact that it's case sensitive when checking if a table exists in the database. The function does not handle the case where the table names are capitalized differently. As a result, the function fails to return the correct result when checking table existence.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the problem and proposes a solution to make the function case insensitive when checking for table existence. The proposed fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function uses `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to check if the lowercased table name is present in the lowercased list of table names in the database, making it case insensitive.

This fix satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
