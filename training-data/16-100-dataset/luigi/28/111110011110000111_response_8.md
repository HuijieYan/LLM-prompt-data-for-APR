Upon analysis, it appears that the bug occurs in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The failing test is showing that the method is case sensitive, causing the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` method is not performing a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name to the stdout received from the hive command. This issue has been identified and described in GitHub Issue #896, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` method case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercased table name.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name to the stdout received from the hive command. This modification will allow the method to correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the modification to perform a case-insensitive check using the lowercased table name and stdout, the `table_exists` method will now correctly identify the existence of the table and pass the failing test. Additionally, this modification addresses the issue raised in GitHub Issue #896.
