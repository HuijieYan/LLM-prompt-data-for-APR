1. The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to determine if a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of the table. The issue seems to be related to the conditionals and the handling of the results from `run_hive_cmd`.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function could be related to how it's handling the results from `run_hive_cmd` and the conditionals for checking if the table exists.

3. The bug's cause is likely to be that the function `table_exists` is not correctly interpreting the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to incorrect results in the conditionals. The failing test is checking for the existence of a table and its case insensitivity, but the function is not returning the expected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the conditional statements to ensure they correctly evaluate the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
   - Verify that the function is handling case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we are now converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase to handle case insensitivity. Additionally, we are directly returning the boolean evaluation of `stdout` without additional conditionals. This should address the issues in the failing test and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
