The buggy function `table_exists` in the `contrib/hive.py` module is used to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The function takes the table name, database name, and optional partition as parameters. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The failing test `test_table_exists` in the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` module is testing the `table_exists` function. The test applies different scenarios to check if the table exists or not, including case insensitivity and partitioned tables. The error message indicates that the `self.assertTrue(returned)` assertion fails in the test case for a table with a different case (`MyTable`) due to the incorrect behavior of the `table_exists` function.

The potential error location in the `table_exists` function is in the 'else' block, where the function checks for the existence of a partitioned table. The condition `if stdout:` checks if the stdout is non-empty, but this might not be a reliable indicator of a partitioned table existence.

The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly determines the existence of a partitioned table based on the non-empty `stdout`. This leads to incorrect results and fails the test case.

To fix the bug:
- In the 'else' block, modify the condition to check for the presence of the partition identifier in the stdout, ensuring that it is a more accurate indicator of a partitioned table's existence.
- Refactor the function to provide consistent behavior for both non-partitioned and partitioned tables.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
            % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        return "OK" in stdout  # Check if partition exists
```

By updating the function to correctly check for the presence of the partition identifier in the stdout for the 'else' block, it ensures that the `table_exists` function accurately determines the existence of both non-partitioned and partitioned tables. This corrected code should pass the failing test provided.
