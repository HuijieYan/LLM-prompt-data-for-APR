The potential error in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called when `partition` is not None. The function is being called with incorrect parameters, leading to the failing test cases.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the problem lies in the usage of incorrect arguments in the `run_hive_cmd` function call when dealing with partitions. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect arguments which causes the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called when dealing with partitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        formatted_partition = ' and '.join(['{0} = \'{1}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, formatted_partition))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, we properly handle the `partition` parameter by formatting it into the expected format for the `run_hive_cmd` function call. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
