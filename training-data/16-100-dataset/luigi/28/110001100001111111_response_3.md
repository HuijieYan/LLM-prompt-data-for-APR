The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check for the table existence. The function is case sensitive, and it checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

The bug's cause is that the function does not account for case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The function needs to be modified to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase, and then perform the check.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue. The function now checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that it works correctly for tables with names in different cases.
