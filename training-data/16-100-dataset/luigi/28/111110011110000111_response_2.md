1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks if a table exists in a given database, and there are issues with case sensitivity. The failing test is trying different cases for table names and partitions and is not producing the expected results. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should be case insensitive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of table names. It seems that the comparison doesn't account for case sensitivity, leading to failures in the test cases.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking if a table exists. The failing test is checking for different cases of table names, and the function is not handling these cases correctly. The GitHub issue also points out that the function should be case insensitive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.
   (b). Refactoring the function to use the `lower()` function for case insensitivity.
   (c). Updating the function based on the suggestions in the GitHub issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is made case insensitive using the `lower()` function. This change ensures that the function is now case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
