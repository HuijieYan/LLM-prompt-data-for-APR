The issue with the function `table_exists` is that it does not take into account the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. This causes the function to fail when trying to match the table name with the output from Hive, which is always returned in lowercase.

The potential error location within the function is where it compares the table name with the output from Hive. 

Based on the actual input/output variable value information and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in Hive.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, the function now behaves in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the issue. This corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
