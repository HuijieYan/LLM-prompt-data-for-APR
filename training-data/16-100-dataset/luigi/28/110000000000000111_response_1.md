1. The buggy function is used to check if a table exists in a database, and it is part of the Luigi library which interfaces with Hive. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of the table_exists function, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase even if they were defined with capital letters. This causes issues when trying to check for table existence.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name to the output of the Hive command. If the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive, the comparison will fail.

3. The cause of the bug is that the table name provided in the function may not match the case of the table name returned by Hive. This issue was identified by a contributor on GitHub who suggested checking the table name against the output in a case-insensitive manner.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.
   - Using a case-insensitive comparison function to compare the table name and the output from Hive.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name and the output from Hive are both converted to lowercase before comparison, allowing for case-insensitive table existence checks. This change aligns with the resolution discussed in the GitHub issue.
