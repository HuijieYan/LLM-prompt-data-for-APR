The issue with the code is that the table comparison is case sensitive, so the function fails when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table in the database.

To fix this issue, the table comparison should be made case insensitive. Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the comparison of the table names in `stdout` and the input parameter `table` has been made case insensitive. This should resolve the failing test cases.
