1. The buggy function is a method called table_exists, which checks if a table exists in a database, possibly with a given partition. It calls the run_hive_cmd function to execute Hive commands and the partition_spec function to get the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else statement where it calls run_hive_cmd with a complex formatted string.

3. The bug's cause is that the else statement in the table_exists function incorrectly calls the run_hive_cmd function with a complex formatted string, which may lead to incorrect execution of the Hive command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Revising the else statement to properly format the Hive command string.
   b. Ensuring that the Hive command in the else statement is correctly formatted and executed.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table), check_return_code=False)
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})", check_return_code=False)
        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code:
- The if and else statements are revised to properly format the Hive command strings.
- The run_hive_cmd functions now have "check_return_code=False" to account for potential errors in the Hive commands.

These changes will help to ensure that the Hive commands are correctly formatted and executed, fixing the bug in the table_exists function.
