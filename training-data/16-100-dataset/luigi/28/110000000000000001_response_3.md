1. The buggy function is designed to check whether a table exists in a given database and partition. However, it has a conditional statement that does not handle the "else" part correctly.

2. The potential error location is the conditional statement that checks if stdout has a value in the "if" part and returns True if it does, but returns False in the "else" part without checking the value of stdout.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional check on stdout in the "else" part does not handle the case where stdout is empty, leading to incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the value of stdout in both the "if" and "else" parts to determine the correct return value.
   - Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors in the run_hive_cmd function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        try:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error while running hive command:", e)
            return False
```

In the corrected code, we have added a try-except block to handle any potential errors in the run_hive_cmd function. We also use the bool function to explicitly convert the value of stdout to a boolean, ensuring that the function returns True if stdout has a value, and False if it is empty or if an error occurs.
