The bug in the provided function is that the table comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the failing tests. The function needs to be modified to make the table comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `table_exists` function to adjust for case insensitivity. You can use the `lower()` method to convert the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lower case before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and the related GitHub issue. The function should now pass the failing tests and behave as expected in the given input/output variable scenarios.
