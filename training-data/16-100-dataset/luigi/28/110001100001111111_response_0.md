The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The current implementation directly checks if the table name is present in the output string returned from the Hive command, without considering the case of the table name.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" suggests that this function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase regardless of their original case.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output string from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
