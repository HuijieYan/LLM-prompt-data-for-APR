Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a given database. The function checks if a partition is provided and then runs a hive command accordingly. The failing test is checking if the function correctly determines if a table exists or not.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is likely in the conditional block where the partition is not `None`. The call to `run_hive_cmd` in that block might not be constructing the command properly.

The buggy function is not handling the `partition` parameter correctly. The `stdout` variable in the else block is not being constructed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is constructed properly.
2. Check the `stdout` variable to see if it's being parsed correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = " and ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code properly constructs the hive command based on the partition parameters and handles it accordingly. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
