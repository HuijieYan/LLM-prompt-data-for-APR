The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case insensitivity for table names. The failing test is checking for the existence of a table called "MyTable" but the function only checks for an exact match in a case-sensitive manner, which causes the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to consider case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. We can achieve this by converting the table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in map(str.lower, stdout.split())  # Check for case-insensitive match
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function should now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
