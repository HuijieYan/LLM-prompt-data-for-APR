1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It is used to determine whether a table exists in a given database, and it has an issue with case sensitivity when comparing table names. The GitHub issue points out that tables defined with capitalized names may not be properly identified due to case sensitivity.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function, as it does not account for case insensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is due to the comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function not accounting for case insensitivity. This is mentioned in the GitHub Issue, where it is stated that tables with capitalized names are returned in lower case, leading to failures in the test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, or using a case-insensitive comparison method such as `strcasecmp` or `toLowerCase`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code makes use of the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is now case insensitive. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
