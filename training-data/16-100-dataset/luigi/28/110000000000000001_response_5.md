1. The function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the `else` part where it runs a Hive command to check for the existence of a partition.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle the output of the Hive command correctly. It checks if `stdout` has a value, which may not accurately determine if the table or partition exists.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the output of the Hive commands more accurately to determine the existence of the table or partition.
   b. Handle any potential errors or unexpected outputs from the Hive commands.
   c. Use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the Hive commands.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout

    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        
        return "OK" in stdout  # Assuming "OK" is part of the stdout if the partition exists
```
In the corrected code, we handle the output of the Hive commands more accurately by checking for specific indicators that the table or partition exists. We also format the Hive commands consistently and handle partition_spec separately to avoid concatenation errors.
