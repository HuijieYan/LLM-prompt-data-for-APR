The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. The function is responsible for checking if a table exists in the given database, and it takes into account the partition as well.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name with the contents of `stdout`. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive to avoid issues.

The cause of the bug is that the function is comparing the table name directly with the stdout, which may not match due to case differences.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" points out that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the `stdout` to avoid issues with case differences. The issue also suggests using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, which will ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function `table_exists` is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
