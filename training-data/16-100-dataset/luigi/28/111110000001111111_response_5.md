The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison should also be case insensitive to correctly determine if the table exists or not.

The function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is used to check if a particular table exists in the database. It takes the table name, database name, and an optional partition as input parameters. It then runs a hive command to check for the existence of the table and returns a boolean value based on the command output.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are due to case sensitivity issues. The expected output from the function does not match the actual output due to case differences in the table names.

The GitHub issue highlights the same problem, where tables with capitalized names are not correctly identified due to case sensitivity. The proposed solution is to check the output against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the command output should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compare the lowercase table name against the lowercase output to ensure that case sensitivity does not affect the table existence check. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
