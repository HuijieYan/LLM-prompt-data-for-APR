1. The buggy function is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. However, there are some issues with the conditional logic and the usage of the partition parameter.

2. The potential error locations are in the conditional statements and the formatting of the Hive command.

3. The bug's cause is due to incorrect conditional checks and the incorrect usage of the partition parameter in the second part of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correcting the conditional statements to check if the stdout is not empty rather than using "and" operator
   - Properly formatting the Hive command and partition specification
   - Revising the logic for checking the existence of the table and handling the partition parameter

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout is not empty

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout is not empty
```
