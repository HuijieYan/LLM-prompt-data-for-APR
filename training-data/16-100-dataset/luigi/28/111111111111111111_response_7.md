The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not handling the case insensitivity of table names properly, which is causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, making the comparison case insensitive.

This should resolve the failing tests and address the issue on GitHub related to case insensitivity.

The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
