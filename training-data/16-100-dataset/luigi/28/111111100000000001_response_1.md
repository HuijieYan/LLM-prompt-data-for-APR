1. The buggy function is a method called "table_exists" within the "HiveCommandClient" class. It calls the "run_hive_cmd" function to execute a Hive query and check if a table exists. If a partition is provided, it also calls the "partition_spec" method to get the partition information. 

2. The potential error location is within the "else" block where the Hive command is being constructed using string formatting.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect construction of the Hive command string in the "else" block. The usage of string formatting seems to be incorrect, and the "self.partition_spec(partition)" should be used to get the partition information.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Verify the correctness of the Hive command string construction in the "else" block.
   - Use the "self.partition_spec(partition)" method to properly construct the command with partition information.
   - Validate the use of string formatting and ensure that it is being used correctly to construct the Hive command.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```
