1. The buggy function is within the HiveCommandClient class and is used to check if a table exists in a given database. It takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition parameter.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statement where the stdout is being assigned based on the presence of the partition parameter.

3. The bug's cause is due to the incorrect formatting and usage of the 'run_hive_cmd' function, and also the usage of the 'partition_spec' function within the conditional statement.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Providing the correct syntax for the 'run_hive_cmd' function and ensuring it is properly defined.
   - Fixing the usage of the 'partition_spec' function within the conditional statement.
   - Adding proper error handling and validation to account for different scenarios.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = 'partition ({0})'.format(self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_clause))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- The run_hive_cmd function is assumed to be properly defined elsewhere.
- The usage of the partition_spec function within the conditional statement has been fixed to properly format the partition clause.
- Proper error handling and validation can be added as needed.
