1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class and is being tested by the `test_table_exists` function in the test file `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning the wrong value.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks whether `stdout` is empty or not.
3. (a). The buggy function is `table_exists`, which is supposed to determine if a table exists in the specified database and may (optionally) check for a specific partition. 
   (b). The `HiveCommandClient` class is where the `table_exists` function is defined, and it also contains another function, `partition_spec`, which seems to be used to build a partition specification string.
   (c). The failing test checks if the `table_exists` function returns the correct response for different scenarios, including checking for a regular table and a partitioned table. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning the wrong value.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function to ensure that they are correctly determining if a table or partition exists.
   - Debug and check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to see if it's returning the expected values.
   - Verify the interaction between the `table_exists` function and the `partition_spec` function to make sure the partition specification is being correctly generated and utilized.

5. Corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query.replace("(", " ("))
        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code, the `table_exists` function correctly splits the output and checks for the table existence in the first case. In the second case, it correctly constructs the partition query and ensures that the `stdout` is converted to a boolean.
