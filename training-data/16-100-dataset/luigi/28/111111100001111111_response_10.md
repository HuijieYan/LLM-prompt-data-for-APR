The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function performs a simple string comparison, which will fail if the case of the table name in the database does not match the case of the input table name.

This discrepancy is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where it is suggested that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table names in the database and the input table name. We will modify the function to convert the table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check when determining the existence of a table in the Hive database.

This corrected code satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue can be closed with this fix.
