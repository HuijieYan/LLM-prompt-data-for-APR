The issue with the `table_exists` function is that the if-else condition is incorrectly checking the presence of a table in the stdout. It should be checking if the table is present in the split stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partitions})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, in the case where `partition` is `None`, we split the `stdout` by newline and check if the `table` is in the list of tables. In the case where `partition` is not `None`, we directly return whether `stdout` has any content.

This should fix the failing tests and provide the expected output for all the provided input cases.
