The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file. The function is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database and partition. The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the behavior of the `table_exists` function, which is failing due to case-sensitivity issues.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the content of stdout. Currently, the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to test failures.

The cause of this bug is that the `table_exists` function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the database. This is causing the test to fail when it expects a case-insensitive match.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive match using the `lower()` function on both the table name and the content of stdout before comparison.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive match, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The corrected code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the case-insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
