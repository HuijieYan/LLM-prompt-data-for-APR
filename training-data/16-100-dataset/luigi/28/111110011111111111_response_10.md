The issue in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes the tests to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match with the case in the output from Hive.

To fix this issue, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output from Hive.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table in Hive, and will pass the failing test cases.

This fix also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub thread, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, and resolves the problem outlined in the failing tests.
