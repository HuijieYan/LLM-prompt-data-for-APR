1. The buggy function is a method called table_exists within the HiveCommandClient class. The method checks if a table exists in a given database and partition. It uses the run_hive_cmd function to run hive commands and returns True if the table exists, False if it does not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else part of the function, where it calls run_hive_cmd to check if the table exists in a specific partition.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect usage of the run_hive_cmd function in the else part of the table_exists method. Additionally, the partition_spec method is being called, but its result is not being used properly in the run_hive_cmd call.

4. The possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the run_hive_cmd function is being called correctly in both the if and else parts of the table_exists method. Additionally, the result of the partition_spec method should be used properly in the run_hive_cmd call.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```
