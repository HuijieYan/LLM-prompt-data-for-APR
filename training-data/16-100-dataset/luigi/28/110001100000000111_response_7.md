The buggy function in the 'luigi/contrib/hive.py' file is 'table_exists'. The issue posted on GitHub indicates that the table_exists function should be case insensitive.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the table name with the 'stdout' variable. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table name comparison should be case insensitive as well.

The bug's cause is that the table name comparison in the 'table_exists' function is case sensitive, leading to issues when checking for existing tables with different case formats.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name with the 'stdout' variable should be made case insensitive.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with 'stdout'.
2. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'table_exists':

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the 'stdout' variable, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the issue raised in the GitHub post.
