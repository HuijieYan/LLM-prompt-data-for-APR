The potential error location within the problematic function is in the "table_exists" method. The issue appears to be with the conditional logic for checking the existence of a table when a partition is specified.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case where a partition is provided. The existing if-else logic is not correctly handling the return value from the "run_hive_cmd" function when a partition is specified.

To fix the bug, the if-else logic for handling the case where a partition is specified needs to be corrected. Additionally, it seems that the return value from "run_hive_cmd" needs to be properly handled to determine the existence of the table with the specified partition.

Here is the corrected version of the "table_exists" function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function should properly handle the case where a partition is specified and return the expected result. This corrected code should pass the failing test cases.
