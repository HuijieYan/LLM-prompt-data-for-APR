1. The buggy function is a method that checks if a table exists in a given database in Hive. The GitHub issue is related to the fact that the table_exists function is case sensitive and does not account for case variations in table names.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. The function does not consider case sensitivity, leading to failures when comparing table names in different cases.

3. The bug's cause is that the table_exists function does not account for case sensitivity in table names. The GitHub issue suggests that tables defined as capitalized may not be found when the function checks for their existence due to case insensitivity in Hive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. Another approach could be to modify the Hive command itself to return case-sensitive table names.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison, which addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
