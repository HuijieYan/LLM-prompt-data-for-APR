The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive. The function is not taking into account the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive, which leads to failing tests.

The issue identified in the GitHub post also confirms that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and resolves the issue raised on GitHub.
