1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method that checks whether a table exists in a specified database with the option to also include a partition specification. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names when checking for their existence in the Hive database.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the tables returned in the `stdout`. The function does not take into account case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function does a direct string comparison without considering the case of the table names. This leads to issues when the table name provided to the function is in a different case than the actual table name in the database. The GitHub issue suggests that when checking for an existing table, the comparison should be case insensitive.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include converting both the table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, or using a case-insensitive comparison function to check for the existence of the table.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in [x.lower() for x in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, we convert both the table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub issue and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence.
