1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `hive.py` file. It is related to the `run_hive_cmd` function and `partition_spec` function from the same file. The related GitHub issue mentions that the table_exists function should be case insensitive, as Hive is case insensitive and can return table names in lowercase even if they are defined in a different case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`, as it does not handle case insensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, leading to test failures when checking for existing tables. The `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to query the Hive tables and then checks the stdout against the table name. The related GitHub issue confirms that the table name should be compared in a case-insensitive manner.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, in order to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. Another approach could be to modify the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the table names in the same case as they are defined, but this would require changes in the underlying Hive implementation.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code ensures that both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the function case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue.
