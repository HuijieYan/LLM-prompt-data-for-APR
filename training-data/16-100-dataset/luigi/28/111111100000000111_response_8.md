1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. This function checks if a table exists in a specified database and is case sensitive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the table name and the output `stdout`. It is currently not handling the case sensitivity issue, leading to potential failures when checking for table existence.

3. The root cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output `stdout` from the Hive command. The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` do not directly contribute to the bug, but they are called within the `table_exists` function.

   The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem, stating that tables defined as capitalized are returned as lowercase by Hive, causing the test to fail. The suggested fix is to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid the case issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
   - Adding a check in the function to handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output `stdout` from the Hive command.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `table_exists`:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code includes converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
