The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line where the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with a string containing the partition_spec. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called correctly for the table name, but the format for the partition_spec is not correct.

The bug's cause is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the wrong format for the partition_spec. Additionally, the condition checking for the existence of the table in the stdout is not correct.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correctly format the partition_spec string before passing it to the `run_hive_cmd` function. Another approach is to improve the condition for checking the existence of the table in the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # code for partition_spec function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = '/'.join(['{}={}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            query = "use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
            return bool(stdout)
```
