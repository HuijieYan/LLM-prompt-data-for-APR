The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. The function seems to have issues in determining whether a table exists in a Hive database. 

The issue is likely due to the `run_hive_cmd` function not returning the expected values in some cases, causing the function to incorrectly determine whether the table exists or not. Additionally, the function seems to have a discrepancy in handling the input parameters, especially when dealing with partitions.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking whether a table exists needs to be revised. The function should also handle partitions correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    else:
        partition_clause = "partition ({})".format(','.join("{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} {}".format(database, table, partition_clause))

    return bool(stdout.strip())
```

This corrected function should resolve the issues by accurately checking for the existence of tables and handling partitions correctly. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
