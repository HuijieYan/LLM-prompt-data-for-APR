The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition for checking the existence of a table. It should return true if the table is found in the stdout, but the current implementation is returning the opposite.

The bug is caused by the incorrect condition checking in the function. The expected and actual values are not matching due to this wrong condition.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition so that it returns true when the table is found in stdout, and false when it is not found.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
