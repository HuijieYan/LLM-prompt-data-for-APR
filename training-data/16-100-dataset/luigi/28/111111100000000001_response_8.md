1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient`. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions from the same file but different classes.

2. The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the use of the `partition_spec` function within the `else` block.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` function within the `else` block. The `partition_spec` function is being called incorrectly with `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `partition_spec` function by creating an instance of the `HiveCommandClient` class.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            client = HiveCommandClient()  # Create an instance of the class
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, client.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the conditional statement
```

In the corrected code, we've created an instance of the `HiveCommandClient` class and use that to call the `partition_spec` function within the `else` block. We also simplified the return statement with `bool(stdout)` to directly return a boolean value.
