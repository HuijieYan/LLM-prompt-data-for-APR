The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the hive database. The function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to avoid test failures due to case mismatches between the expected and actual table names.

To fix the bug, the 'table_exists' function should convert the table name to lowercase and use that for comparison with the result from the hive database. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the 'table_exists' function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the 'table_exists' function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, the fix addresses the issue posted in the GitHub link by making the table existence check case insensitive.
