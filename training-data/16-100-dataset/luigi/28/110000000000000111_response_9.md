1. The buggy function is a method for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names. The issue states that Hive is case insensitive, but the function does not account for this, leading to failures when checking for existing tables with different cases.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The function is not accounting for case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The GitHub issue highlights this as an issue and suggests comparing the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive to avoid case issues.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase and compare it with the output from Hive, which is also converted to lowercase. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue raised in the GitHub report.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison between the table name and the stdout from Hive is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before the comparison. This resolves the case sensitivity issue and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
