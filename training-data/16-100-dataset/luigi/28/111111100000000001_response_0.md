1. The buggy function `table_exists` is located within the class `HiveCommandClient` and it calls the function `run_hive_cmd` to run hive commands. It also calls the `partition_spec` function to get the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `else` statement where it tries to run a hive command with the partition specification.

3. The cause of the bug is as follows:
   (a). The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a database and partition. If a partition is provided, it runs a hive command to check for the existence of the partition. 
   (b). The `HiveCommandClient` class contains the `table_exists` function and is responsible for using `hive` invocations to find information.
   (c). The `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions are used within the `table_exists` function to run hive commands and obtain the partition specification, respectively.
   
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for the correct syntax of the hive command being executed in the `else` statement.
   - Verify that the `partition_spec` function is returning the correct partition specification.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_string = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_string))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code:
- The `else` statement now correctly forms the partition specification string using the provided partition dictionary. 
- The hive command is updated to use the correct syntax.
- The return statement is simplified to directly return the boolean value based on the `stdout` variable.
