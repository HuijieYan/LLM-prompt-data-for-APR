1. The buggy function is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The GitHub issue relates to the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failures when the table name is in a different case than expected. The issue suggests to check the table name in a case-insensitive manner to avoid these problems.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. 

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. The GitHub issue mentions that when checking for an existing table with a capitalized name, the stdout will return with a lowercase name, causing the test to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: 
   - converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison
   - using a case-insensitive comparison function
   - modifying the Hive command to return the table names with a specific case

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
