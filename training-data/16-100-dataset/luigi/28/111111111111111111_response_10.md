The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names while checking for their existence in the database. This leads to failing tests where the expected value does not match the actual value due to case differences in table names.

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and also address the issue posted in the GitHub discussion. The function now compares the table names in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the tests will not fail due to case differences in table names.
