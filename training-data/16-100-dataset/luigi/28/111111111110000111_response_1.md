The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is responsible for checking whether a table exists in the specified database, and handles the case where a partition is provided as well.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. It seems that the comparison is case sensitive, leading to the test failures.

The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function directly compares the provided table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, without considering case sensitivity. This leads to assertion errors in the failing test cases, as the comparison fails when the case of the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` do not match.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lower case for case-insensitive comparison. This will ensure that the function works correctly irrespective of the case of the table name and the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are both converted to lower case before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive.

This corrected code would pass the failing test cases and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue #896.
