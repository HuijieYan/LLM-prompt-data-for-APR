The buggy function "table_exists" in the class "HiveCommandClient" is supposed to check if a table exists in a hive database. The issue arises when the function does not properly handle case sensitivity. The failing test shows that when checking for a table that exists with a different case than expected, the function fails to return the correct result.

The cause of the bug is that the function does a direct string comparison without considering case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results when the table name has a different case than expected.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output of the hive command to lowercase and then perform the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure the correct result is returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this corrected code, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table. This will address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue. The corrected code should ensure that the function passes the failing test and resolves the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue.
