The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of the table name when checking against the Hive stdout. The function is currently checking for an exact match of the table name, which causes issues when the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for the lowercase version of the table name in the stdout. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code checks for the lowercase version of the table name in the stdout, making the comparison case-insensitive and fixing the bug.

The GitHub issue title for this bug can be:
"Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive"

And the detailed description for the GitHub issue can be:
"Check stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues"

This fix should resolve the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function and prevent the failing tests.
