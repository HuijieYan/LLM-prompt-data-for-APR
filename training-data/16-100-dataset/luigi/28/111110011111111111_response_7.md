The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive. When checking if a table exists in Hive, the function does a case-sensitive comparison, leading to test failures for tables with different cases than the one provided in the function call.

The error location in the problematic function is the condition `table in stdout`. This condition is case sensitive and does not account for different cases of the table name.

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is being tested by the `test_table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class. The error message shows that the test failed when trying to check if a table exists with a different case than the one provided in the function call.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in Hive.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if a table exists. The comparison should be done using the lowercase version of the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison, which should resolve the failing tests and the issue reported on GitHub.
