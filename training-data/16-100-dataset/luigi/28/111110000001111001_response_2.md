The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be in the condition where the `partition` parameter is not None. In this case, it is trying to concatenate the partition specification with the Hive command, but it's not using the command correctly.

To fix this bug, we should use the correct format for the Hive command in both cases and check the presence of the table or partition in the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_specs = "/".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_specs});')
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This function will now correctly construct the Hive command for each case and return the expected result.
