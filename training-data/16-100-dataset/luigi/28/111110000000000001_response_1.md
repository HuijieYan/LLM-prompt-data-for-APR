1. The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It checks for the existence of a table in a specified database, with an optional partition condition.

2. The potential error is in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, where the `run_hive_cmd` command is not properly formatted.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function contains conditional logic to check for the existence of a table in a database, with an optional partition condition. It concatenates the database and table names to form a query and runs it using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
   (b) The class seems to be extending another class `HiveClient` and is used to interact with a Hive database using hive invocations.

The bug is caused by the improper use of string formatting and concatenation in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, leading to an incorrectly formatted Hive command.

4. To fix the bug, one approach would be to properly format the Hive command using string formatting methods such as `format()` or f-strings in Python. Additionally, we can also ensure that the conditionals are correctly handled to cover all possible cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code, the Hive command is properly formatted using `format()` and the optional partition condition is handled using a join operation on the partition dictionary. Additionally, the return statement in the `else` block is simplified to directly return the evaluation of `stdout`.
