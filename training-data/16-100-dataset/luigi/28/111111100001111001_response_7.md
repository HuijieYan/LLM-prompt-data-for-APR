The bug in the `table_exists` function is located in the conditional statement when checking for the existence of a table with a specific partition. The bug causes the function to always return `True` regardless of the actual existence of the table with the given partition.

The cause of the bug is that the `stdout` variable is being used to check for the existence of a table with a specific partition, but the condition `if stdout:` will always return `True` as long as `stdout` is not empty, regardless of the table's actual existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to properly check for the existence of the table with the given partition.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_output = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
        if partition_output:
            partitions = partition_output.split('\n')
            for p in partitions:
                if partition.items() <= dict(item.split('=') for item in p.split('/')).items():
                    return True
            return False
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code properly checks for the existence of the table with a specific partition and returns `True` only if the table with the given partition is found.
