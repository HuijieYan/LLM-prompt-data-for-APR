1. The buggy function `table_exists` is calling the function `run_hive_cmd` to run a hive command and check if a table exists in a database. It also calls the function `partition_spec` to get the partition specification for a given partition.

2. The potential error is the use of `self.partition_spec` instead of simply `partition_spec` when calling the function.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `partition_spec` is not defined within the scope of the `table_exists` function. Instead, it seems to be a separate function, and therefore should be called without using `self`.

4. The bug can be fixed by either importing the necessary function into the `table_exists` function or by directly calling the function without using `self`.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
def table_exists(table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = '' if partition_spec(partition) is None else " partition ({})".format(partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```
In the corrected code, the function `partition_spec` is called directly without using `self`. Additionally, the conditional statement is simplified and the return value is explicitly converted to a boolean.
