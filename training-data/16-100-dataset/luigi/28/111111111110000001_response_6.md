The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the 'if' statement where the stdout is being checked. The if statement checks if stdout has a value, but it should be checking for the presence of the table in the stdout when partition is None.

The cause of the bug is that in the 'else' part of the 'if' statement, the condition for returning True or False is incorrect. If stdout is not empty, it should return True, but it is currently returning False.

To fix the bug, we should modify the 'if' condition in the 'else' part to check if the table is in the stdout, and change the return statements accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({spec})')
        return spec in stdout if stdout else False
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test provided.
