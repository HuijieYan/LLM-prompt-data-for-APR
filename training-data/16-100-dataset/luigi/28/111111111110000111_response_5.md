The issue is with the table_exists function in the HiveCommandClient class in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file. The buggy function is not handling the case insensitivity of the table name, which is causing the test to fail. The failing test is checking for the existence of a table with different cases, and the function is not handling this correctly. This issue has been reported in GitHub as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the table_exists function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the table_exists function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner (by converting both the table name and stdout to lower case), we can ensure that the function handles case insensitivity correctly.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
