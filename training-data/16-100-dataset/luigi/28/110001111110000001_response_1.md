Analysis:
The buggy function is `table_exists` which has an issue in the else block. In the else block, the function `run_hive_cmd` is called with incorrect formatting for the hive command. This causes the test to fail when checking if a table exists.

The failing test is checking if the table exists and the error message is showing an "AssertionError" because the function is returning False when it's expected to return True.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the hive command in the else block of the `table_exists` function. This causes the function to return False instead of True when checking for the existence of a table.

Possible Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the formatting of the hive command in the else block of the `table_exists` function to make sure it matches the correct syntax for checking the existence of a table in Hive.
2. Update the function to properly handle the partition argument and use it when constructing the hive command in the else block.
3. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the expected output in the failing test to verify the correctness of the fix.

Corrected Code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        hive_cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_string)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(hive_cmd)
        return bool(stdout)
```

With the above corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now properly support the partition argument and return the correct result based on the hive command output.
