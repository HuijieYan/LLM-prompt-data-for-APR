The bug in the function is caused by the table_exists method not being case insensitive. The method checks if the table exists in the database by matching the table name with the stdout from the hive command. However, the comparison is case sensitive, leading to failures when the table names have different casing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the table_exists method to perform a case insensitive match between the table name and the stdout.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # other methods...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the table_exists method now performs a case insensitive match between the table name and the stdout, resolving the case sensitivity issue.

This corrected code will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub ticket, making the table_exists method case insensitive.
