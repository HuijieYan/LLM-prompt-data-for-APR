The issue in the function is that in the case where partition is not None, when calling run_hive_cmd, the function self.partition_spec(partition) should be used to build the command, but it is using '%s' instead of calling the function. This is causing the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the '%s' with the result of calling self.partition_spec(partition) to build the command string inside the else block of the table_exists function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
