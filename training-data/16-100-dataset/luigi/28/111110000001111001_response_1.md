The bug in the function is due to an incorrect formatting of the hive command when handling partitions. The `run_hive_cmd` call is not correctly formatted and does not handle the partition information properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the partition information when it is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code now correctly handles the partition information when it is provided and should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
