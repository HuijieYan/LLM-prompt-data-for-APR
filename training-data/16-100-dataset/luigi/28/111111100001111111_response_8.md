The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive. The function compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity, leading to failing tests when the table name is in a different case.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification ensures that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is case insensitive, which should resolve the failing tests.

Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub suggests the same solution, so this fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.

The GitHub issue titles would be:

1. "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?"
2. "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive"
