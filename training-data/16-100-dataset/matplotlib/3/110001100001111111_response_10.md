Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue appears to be with the _filled variable in the _recache function. When the self._fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled variable should be set to False, but it is incorrectly set to True in the buggy function.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is not properly handling the case where self._fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in markers not being hollow as expected.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
Update the _recache function to properly handle the case where self._fillstyle is 'none' by setting the _filled variable to False when self._fillstyle is 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code should properly handle the case where self._fillstyle is 'none' and ensure that the markers are hollow as expected. This fix will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
