1. The buggy function is within the class MarkerStyle and it is called _recache. This function is supposed to update the marker style properties if the marker function is not None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it tries to call the _marker_function without checking if it exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the function tries to call _marker_function without checking if it exists, which can lead to an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if _marker_function is not None before calling it.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
