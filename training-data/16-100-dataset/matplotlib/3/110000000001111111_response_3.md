The issue in the provided buggy function is that it sets self._filled to True unconditionally, without considering the input parameter self._fillstyle. This causes the markers to always be filled, regardless of the fillstyle specified by the user.

The GitHub issue describes a situation where the user wants to set the markers hollow by setting fillstyle to 'none', but it's not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the self._filled variable is set based on the value of self._fillstyle. If self._fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled should be set to False, otherwise it should be True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the function will now set self._filled based on the value of self._fillstyle, and the markers will be hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none', resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
