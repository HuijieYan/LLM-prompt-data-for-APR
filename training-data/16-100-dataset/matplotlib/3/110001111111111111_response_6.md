The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `False` unconditionally, while it should be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. The expected behavior is that when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be `False`, and when it is anything else, `_filled` should be `True`. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_recache` function to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function should set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle` as expected. This will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` behaves correctly when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, as it addresses the incorrect behavior when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.
