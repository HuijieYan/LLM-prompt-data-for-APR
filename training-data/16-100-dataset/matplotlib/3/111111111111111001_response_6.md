The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting `self._filled` to `True` when it should be the opposite. This conflicts with the expected value and type of the variable `self._filled`, which should be `True` instead of `False`. This is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Updated to set filled to False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
