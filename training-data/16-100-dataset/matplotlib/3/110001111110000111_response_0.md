1. The problematic function is _recache(self) from the markers.py file in the matplotlib library. This function is responsible for recaching the marker properties. The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle from the test_marker.py file tests the MarkerStyle class and specifically checks the fillstyle property. The error message indicates that the is_filled method is returning True when it should be False.

The GitHub issue reports that setting fillstyle='none' does not result in hollow markers when using ax.scatter() with a custom MarkerStyle.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _marker_function() call. It seems that this function is not properly updating the filled property of the MarkerStyle.

3. The bug is likely caused by the _marker_function() not correctly updating the filled property of the MarkerStyle. This is supported by the failing test where is_filled() returns True when it should be False after setting fillstyle='none'. The GitHub issue further confirms this as the user expects hollow markers but does not get the desired result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Ensuring that the _marker_function() properly updates the filled property based on the fillstyle.
   b. Reviewing the implementation of _marker_function() and how it affects the filled property.
   c. Checking for any potential conflicts or overriding of the filled property.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled property based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, providing the expected behavior for hollow markers when using fillstyle='none'.
