1. The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. This method is called to update the marker style attributes, but the issue reported on GitHub suggests that the `fillstyle` parameter is not being properly applied when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely with how the `_marker_function` is being called, as this is where the marker attributes are updated.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_recache` method is not properly updating the marker attributes, which results in the `fillstyle` not being applied as expected.
   (b). The `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for defining marker styles.
   (c). The `ax.scatter()` function is used to create a scatter plot, and the custom `MarkerStyle` is not properly applied when using this function.
   (d). The GitHub issue information confirms that the `fillstyle` parameter is not working as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_marker_function` updates the `fillstyle` attribute properly.
   - Check for any other potential issues with applying custom marker styles.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._marker_function(self.get_fillstyle())
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

By passing the `fillstyle` attribute to the `_marker_function`, the corrected code will ensure that the `fillstyle` gets properly updated when using a custom `MarkerStyle`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
