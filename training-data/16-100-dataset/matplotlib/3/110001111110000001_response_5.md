The buggy function `_recache` is used to reset the marker properties to their default values. The bug seems to be in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is trying to call a marker function that is not defined within the `_recache` function.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks whether the marker style is filled or not, and the error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` should be replaced with the actual method that handles the filling behavior of the marker. Additionally, the `is_filled` method should be updated to correctly reflect the state of the marker.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # fix: check if _marker_function is not None
        self._marker_function()
    else:  # fix: set default marker properties if _marker_function is None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function properly handles the marker properties and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass.
