The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` in the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This means that even if `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will still be filled.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should check the value of `self._filled` and set it accordingly based on the `fillstyle`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_recache` method to check the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
2. Add a new method to handle setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        # New logic to set _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post, and it resolves the failing test by ensuring that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
