1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the MarkerStyle class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. It seems to be responsible for resetting some attributes of the MarkerStyle instance. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the file `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` is checking if the marker style is properly filled or not. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is likely the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the marker to be filled by default, which may be overriding any attempt to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default, which may be conflicting with the intention to create hollow markers using the `fillstyle` parameter.
   (b). The failing test checks the `is_filled()` method after setting `fillstyle` to 'none', but it does not return the expected value.
   (c). The failing test's error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which suggests that the marker is still being considered as filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
   (d). The GitHub issue confirms that the intended behavior of creating hollow markers is not being achieved by setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute and properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.
   - Update the `is_filled` method to correctly reflect the filled status based on the `fillstyle`.
   - Ensure that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' results in hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check fillstyle and set filled status
    self._marker_function()
    
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled
```

With these updates, the `_recache` function considers the `fillstyle` when setting the filled status, and the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle`. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
