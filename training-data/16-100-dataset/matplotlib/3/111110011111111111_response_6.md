The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. The declared type of `self._filled` is a bool, so setting it to `True` directly contradicts the expected values of the failing test.

The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to be `False` unconditionally. This led to the failing test returning `assert not True`, which indicates that `marker_style.is_filled()` returned `True` when it was expected to be `False`.

The GitHub issue provides an example of setting the fillstyle as 'none' but not getting the expected hollow markers.

To fix this issue, the `_recache` function should set the `_filled` attribute to `False` only if the `_fillstyle` is not equal to 'none'. Otherwise, it should set `_filled` to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the GitHub issue should no longer encounter the problem of not getting the expected hollow markers.
