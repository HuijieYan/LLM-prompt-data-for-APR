1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` from `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`. It is called when a MarkerStyle object is created or updated. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is from `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` and it tests the `fillstyle` property of a MarkerStyle object. The failing test is related to the GitHub issue which mentions that markers are not hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._marker_function()` that calls a marker function without checking if it exists or not.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not properly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`, which causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail with the error message indicating that the fillstyle property is not being set correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check before calling `self._marker_function()` to ensure that it is not `None`.
   - If `self._marker_function` is `None`, handle it gracefully without calling it.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved. The MarkerStyle with fillstyle set to 'none' should now render hollow markers as expected.
