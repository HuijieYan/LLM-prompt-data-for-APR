Potential error location: The bug seems to be located at the line self._marker_function(). This line is trying to call the _marker_function without checking if it has been defined or not. 

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by trying to call self._marker_function without checking if it has been defined or not. This can lead to an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.
2. Set a default value for self._marker_function if it is not defined.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Set a default marker function or handle the case where it is not defined
        pass
```
