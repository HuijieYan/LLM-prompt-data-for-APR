1. The buggy function is named _recache and is a method of the MarkerStyle class. The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle is testing the MarkerStyle's ability to correctly handle the fillstyle attribute. The error message indicates that the method is_filled is not returning the expected value.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the _filled attribute to True, which might be causing the is_filled method to return True even when it shouldn't.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is setting _filled to True unconditionally, which conflicts with the intended behavior of the MarkerStyle.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the _filled attribute is set based on the actual fillstyle specified during the MarkerStyle object instantiation. This could involve adding a conditional statement to check for the fillstyle value and setting _filled accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _filled attribute will be set based on the fillstyle specified during marker instantiation, and the failing test should pass.
