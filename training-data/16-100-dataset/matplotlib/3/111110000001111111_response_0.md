The buggy function `_recache` from the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `self._fillstyle` parameter. This is causing the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers should be hollow.

The potential error location within the function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is not being updated based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter.

To fix the bug, the function should check the value of `self._fillstyle` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, allowing the markers to be displayed as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread, allowing users to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'`.
