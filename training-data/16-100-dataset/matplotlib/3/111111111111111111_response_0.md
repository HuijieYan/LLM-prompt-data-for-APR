The bug in the provided function seems to be related to filling markers. The function should set self._filled to True when the fillstyle is 'none', but it currently does not do that. This discrepancy is causing the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to set self._filled to True when the fillstyle is 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
            self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the fillstyle 'none' and set the `_filled` variable to True accordingly.

This correction should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
