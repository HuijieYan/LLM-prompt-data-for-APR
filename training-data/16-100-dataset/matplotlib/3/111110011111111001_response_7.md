The potential error in the problematic function is with the `_filled` variable not being set correctly. The failing test expects the `is_filled()` method to return False when `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` in the buggy function, which causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is set to `False` when `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable information would be satisfied.
