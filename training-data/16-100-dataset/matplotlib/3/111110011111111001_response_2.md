The buggy function is `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` uses the `is_filled` method, which checks the value of the `_filled` variable. The `_recache` function is incorrectly setting `_filled` to `False` instead of `True`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `False` instead of `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` to `True` instead of `False`. Additionally, we need to remove the unnecessary setting of `_filled` to `True` since it is already set to `True` by default.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Remove the unnecessary setting of _filled to True here
    self._marker_function()
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True after calling _marker_function
```

With these changes, the `_recache` function should now correctly set the `_filled` variable to `True`, and the failing test should pass.
