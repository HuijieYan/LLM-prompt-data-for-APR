1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to reset attributes of a MarkerStyle object. It is called when the `marker_function` attribute is not None. However, there is an issue with the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly, leading to failing tests and issues for users.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a). The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.
   (b). The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects `marker_style.is_filled()` to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which is not the case due to the bug in the function.
   (c). The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected, indicating that the bug affects users as well.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the `fillstyle` parameter and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly in the `_recache` function.
   - Modifying the `is_filled` method of the MarkerStyle class to evaluate the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the MarkerStyle object, ensuring that it reflects the intended fill style.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
