1. The buggy function is the `_recache` method inside the `MarkerStyle` class. It seems that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute is not being set to `False` as expected, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be `False`. This causes the assertion error in the failing test.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line: `self._filled = True`. This should be `self._filled = False` when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

3. 
   a. The buggy function is the `_recache` method which is supposed to recache the marker style attributes.
   b. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method and is used by the failing test to check the fillstyle and if the marker is filled.
   c. The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not. The error message shows that the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should be `False`.
   d. The expected input/output variable information suggests that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be `False`, but the actual value is `True`.
   e. The GitHub issue reflects the mismatch between the expected behavior of setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' and the actual behavior when using `ax.scatter()` and `markers.MarkerStyle`.

4. To fix the bug, we can simply update the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This should resolve the issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle`, the corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
