The issue here is in the _recache function of the MarkerStyle class. The function is supposed to set the marker to be hollow if the fillstyle is 'none', but it is not doing so.

The cause of the bug is in the _recache function. It sets self._filled to True unconditionally at the end of the function, instead of checking the fillstyle.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding a condition to check the fillstyle and setting self._filled accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the MarkerStyle class should now correctly handle the fillstyle 'none' and set the marker to be hollow when used with ax.scatter(). This fix should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
