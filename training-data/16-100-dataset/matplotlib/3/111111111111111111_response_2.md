The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_filled` variable being set to `False` instead of `True`.

The bug is caused by the `_filled` variable being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the expected behavior of setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` resulting in hollow markers.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` in the `_recache` function if the `fillstyle` is not `'full'`.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
