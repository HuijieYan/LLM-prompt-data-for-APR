The issue here is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function. However, the expected value of `_filled` in Case 1 is `True`. This causes the test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail, as the expected value is `True` but the actual value is `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` variable to `True` conditionally.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a condition to only set `_filled` to `True` if `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` variable will only be set to `True` if the `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`, as expected in the failing test case. This will also resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report, where setting the fillstyle to 'none' did not result in a hollow marker as expected.
