The issue with the buggy function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` irrespective of the value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix this issue, the function should check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the function will set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and as a result, the failing test should now pass.
