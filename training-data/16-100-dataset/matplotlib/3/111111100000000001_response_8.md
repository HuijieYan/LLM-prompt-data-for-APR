1. The buggy function is part of a class called MarkerStyle. It is responsible for handling marker styles in the matplotlib library. The function _recache is supposed to reset certain attributes and then call a marker function, but there are some issues with the implementation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "self._marker_function()". It appears that the intention was to call a marker function, but there is no assignment or definition of this function within the class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to call a non-existent marker function. This is evident from the fact that the _marker_function attribute is not checked or initialized anywhere in the class or related functions.

4. To fix the bug, we need to either remove the line that is trying to call _marker_function or properly define and initialize this attribute within the class. If the intention is to call a different function, then the correct function name should be used.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the correct file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected class definition
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        # reset attributes
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

        # call a hypothetical marker function
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, the function has been modified to check if _marker_function is not None before attempting to call it. Additionally, the function call has been moved inside this conditional statement. This ensures that the marker function is only called if it has been properly defined.
