The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to set the default values for a series of variables if they are not already set. However, it is mistakenly setting `self._filled` to `False` and calling `self._marker_function()` at the end of the function, while it is expected to be `True` and not call `self._marker_function()`.

The cause of this bug is the incorrect assignment of `self._filled` and the unnecessary call to `self._marker_function()`.

To fix this bug, we should change the value of `self._filled` to `True` and remove the unnecessary call to `self._marker_function()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Changed from False to True
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will now correctly set the default values for the variables and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
