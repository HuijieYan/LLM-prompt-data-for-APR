The buggy function is a method named _recache that belongs to the class markers.MarkerStyle in the file markers.py. This method is used to reset certain attributes of the marker style to their default values. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the inability to create hollow markers by setting the fillstyle to 'none' when using ax.scatter().

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(). This line is attempting to call a function that may not exist, which could be the cause of the issue reported on GitHub.

The cause of the bug:
(a) The buggy function, _recache, is not properly handling the fillstyle parameter when setting markers as hollow.
(b) The related functions, particularly the marker handling functions in the markers module, may not be interacting correctly with the fillstyle parameter.
(c) The GitHub issue information indicates that setting fillstyle to 'none' when using ax.scatter() does not produce the expected hollow markers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the _marker_function is being set correctly and if it exists. If it does not exist, ensure that the appropriate function is called to handle the marker's fillstyle.
2. Verify that the handling of the fillstyle parameter is consistent across all functions that utilize markers, such as ax.scatter().

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Update to properly handle fillstyle
    # Call the marker function with fillstyle as a parameter
    self._marker_function(fillstyle=self.get_fillstyle())  # Passing fillstyle to the marker function
```
In the corrected code above, I made the following changes:
1. Checked the fillstyle for 'none' to properly handle whether the marker is filled or not.
2. Passed the fillstyle as a parameter to the _marker_function, ensuring that the fillstyle is handled correctly when drawing the markers.
