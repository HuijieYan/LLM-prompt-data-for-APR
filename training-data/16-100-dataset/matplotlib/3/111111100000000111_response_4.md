1. The buggy function is the _recache function within the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is called when a MarkerStyle object is instantiated and is responsible for setting various attributes of the marker style. The GitHub issue suggests that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is causing the marker_function to be called without checking for a condition, which might not be intended behavior.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is calling self._marker_function() without checking if it is meant to be called. The GitHub issue indicates that setting fillstyle to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected, which suggests that the _marker_function might be responsible for this behavior.

4. To fix the bug, the _recache function should only call self._marker_function if it is intended to do so based on input parameters or other conditions. Additionally, the _marker_function should be reviewed to ensure that it behaves as expected when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._filled:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check for self._filled before calling self._marker_function, the function will now only call the marker function if the marker is intended to be filled. It would be advisable to also review the _marker_function to ensure it behaves as expected when fillstyle is set to 'none', as indicated in the GitHub issue.
