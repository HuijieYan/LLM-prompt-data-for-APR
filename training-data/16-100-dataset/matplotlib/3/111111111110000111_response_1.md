1. The buggy function is `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is located in the `test_marker.py` file, and the error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is incorrectly setting the marker to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to markers being filled when they should be hollow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that markers are not filled when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
   - Checking the implementation of the `is_filled` method to ensure it returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() in ['full', 'left', 'right']:  # Check fillstyle to determine if marker is filled
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter to determine whether the marker should be filled. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass.
