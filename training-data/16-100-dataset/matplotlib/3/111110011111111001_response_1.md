The potential error in the buggy function is that it is setting the `_filled` variable to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle` and this is causing the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, even if the `self._fillstyle` is 'none'.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the value of `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` before setting it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the updated `_recache` function will set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which should resolve the failing test case.
