Potential error location: The _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally, which does not match the expected value for Case 1.

Bug's Cause: The _filled variable is being set to True regardless of the input value of self._fillstyle.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to take into account the input value of self._fillstyle and set the _filled variable accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
