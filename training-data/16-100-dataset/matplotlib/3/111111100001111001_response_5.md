The bug in the function is that the _filled variable is incorrectly set to False instead of True. This discrepancy causes the function to return the wrong value for _filled.

To fix this bug, the _filled variable should be set to True instead of False. 

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Updated this line to set _filled to True instead of False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will return the correct value for _filled in all cases, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
