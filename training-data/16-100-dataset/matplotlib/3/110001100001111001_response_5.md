Analyzing the buggy function and the expected output, we can see that the problem lies in the line `self._filled = True`. This line should check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly. Additionally, the property `self._marker_function` should be called only if it exists.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check and set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. We should also check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly set the value of `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle` and only call `self._marker_function` if it exists. This will address the issues identified in the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
