1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the matplotlib library and is responsible for resetting various properties when a marker style is changed. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which checks if the marker is filled or hollow. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the user is trying to set markers as hollow by using the `fillstyle` parameter, but it is not having the expected effect.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is in the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the marker as filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `_recache` function sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally.
   (b). The failing test is checking if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`, but it's actually returning `True` due to the unconditional setting of `self._filled` in the `_recache` function.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that the `fillstyle` parameter is not working as expected and the markers are not being rendered as hollow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `self._filled` property.
   (b). Update the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the `is_filled` method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check fillstyle before setting filled
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` property will be set based on the `fillstyle`, and the `MarkerStyle` class will properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and the `is_filled` method, thus passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
