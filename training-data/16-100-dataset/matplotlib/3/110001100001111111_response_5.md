The issue is related to the markers not being displayed as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' in the MarkerStyle. This is likely due to the _filled variable not being updated correctly in the _recache function of the MarkerStyle.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where _filled is set to True unconditionally.

The bug's cause is that the _filled variable is unconditionally set to True within the _recache function, which overrides the fillstyle='none' setting.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the fillstyle is 'none' and then set _filled to False accordingly.
2. Update the _recache function to handle the fillstyle parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # check the fillstyle and update _filled accordingly
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code will properly update the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter, ensuring that the markers are displayed as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'. This fix will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
