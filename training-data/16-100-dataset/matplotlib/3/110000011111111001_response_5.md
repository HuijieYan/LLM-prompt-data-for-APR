The bug is caused by the `_filled` variable being set to `True` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should be returning `False` based on the input `fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_filled` variable based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set the `_filled` variable based on the input value of `self._fillstyle`, which should then allow the `is_filled()` method to behave as expected and pass the failing test.
