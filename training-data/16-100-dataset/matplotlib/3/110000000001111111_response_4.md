Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue is caused by the `_filled` variable not being set to the correct value in the `_recache` function. The expected behavior is that when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers should be hollow. However, this is not the case due to the `_filled` variable being set to True in the buggy function.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to False when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This will ensure that the markers are hollow as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now properly handle the fillstyle, ensuring that markers are hollow when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers are not hollow when a custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'` is used.
