1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the matplotlib library. It seems to be responsible for setting various attributes related to the marker style. The GitHub issue mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line calls a function without checking if it exists, and it should be handled differently to prevent potential errors.

3. (a). The buggy function: The function calls `self._marker_function()` without any checks.
   (b). The buggy class: The `MarkerStyle` class seems to handle marker styling but may not be applying the desired changes when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
   (c). The related functions: It seems there might be a missing function related to the marker styling.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The user is not getting the expected result when using `fillstyle='none'` with `ax.scatter()`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adding a condition to ensure that the `_marker_function` exists and is callable. Additionally, the behavior of `fillstyle='none'` should be checked within the `MarkerStyle` class to ensure it results in hollow markers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            # Add handling for the case when _marker_function is not callable
            pass
```

Additional changes may be necessary in the `MarkerStyle` class to handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter and ensure that it results in hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter()`.
