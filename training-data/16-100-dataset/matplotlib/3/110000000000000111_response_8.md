1. The buggy function is not directly related to the GitHub issue. The GitHub issue involves setting markers to be hollow using markers.MarkerStyle and fillstyle='none', while the buggy function appears to be a method used internally within matplotlib for recaching marker properties.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`, which seems to be intended to call a marker function, but it's not clear how this function is defined or what it should do.

3. The cause of the bug may be related to the incorrect usage of the markers.MarkerStyle and fillstyle parameter, which seems to be the focus of the GitHub issue. The buggy function itself does not seem to be related to the marker styling issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - First, address the issue with marker styling in the GitHub report by checking the correct usage of markers.MarkerStyle and fillstyle='none'.
   - Then, review the _recache function to determine the intended purpose of self._marker_function and make appropriate changes to that part of the code.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # check if the marker function is defined
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()  # call the marker function only if it is defined
```

This corrected function adds a check to ensure that the marker function is defined before calling it, addressing any potential issue related to the usage of self._marker_function. However, it does not directly address the marker styling issue described in the GitHub report.
