The buggy function is a part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module. The function is expected to recache the marker properties when called. The failing test is checking for the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, and it is expected to return False when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it is currently returning True, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of `_filled` to True irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter.

The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting `_filled` to True irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter. This is in conflict with the expected behavior of the `is_filled()` method when `fillstyle` is 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should consider the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` property accordingly. Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when setting `fillstyle` to 'none' should also be resolved.
