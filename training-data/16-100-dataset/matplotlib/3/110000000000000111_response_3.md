1. The buggy function is a method named _recache, which is part of a larger class related to matplotlib markers. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow, but the fillstyle parameter does not seem to be working as expected when using ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of self._filled to True, which may be overriding the intended behavior of making the markers hollow.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is setting the _filled attribute to True, which may be conflicting with the intention of making the markers hollow as specified in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the documentation or source code for matplotlib to understand how marker styles and fill styles are intended to work together
   - Experimenting with different combinations of marker and fill styles to find the correct configuration for creating hollow markers
   - Consulting the matplotlib community or documentation for guidance on how to achieve the desired hollow marker effect

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # This line was changed from True to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By changing the assignment of self._filled to False, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue with hollow markers when using ax.scatter() and setting the fillstyle parameter to 'none'.
