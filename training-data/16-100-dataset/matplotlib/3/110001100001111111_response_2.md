Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the _recache function. The expected output for the filled variable is True, but the actual output is False.

Bug's cause:
The _recache function is not setting the _filled variable to True when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is causing the markers to not be hollow as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the _recache function to check the fillstyle and set the _filled variable accordingly.
2. Modify the MarkerStyle constructor to set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly set the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter, and the markers should appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
