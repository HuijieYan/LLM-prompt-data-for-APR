Potential error location: The bug is likely caused by the `_marker_function` being called with no arguments, which could cause an error if it is expecting arguments.

Bug's cause: The function `_marker_function` is being called without passing any arguments, which could cause an error if it's expecting arguments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` expects any arguments, and pass them accordingly.
2. Add error handling to the `_marker_function` to handle the case where it's called without arguments.

Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if inspect.signature(self._marker_function).parameters:
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        self._marker_function(self)
```
