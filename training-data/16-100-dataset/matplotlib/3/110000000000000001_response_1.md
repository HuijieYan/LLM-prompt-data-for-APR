1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` defined within a class. It is meant to reset certain attributes and then call a marker function if it's not None.

2. The potential error location within the function is the call to `_marker_function()` without checking if it is not None.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not check if `_marker_function` is None before calling it, which could result in a potential AttributeError if the function is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent any potential errors due to calling a non-existent function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
