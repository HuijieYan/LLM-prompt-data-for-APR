The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is not implemented, which is causing the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, and it should return the value of the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # other methods and attributes...

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test for the `is_filled` method should pass, and it should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.

This correction should fix the bug and satisfy both the failing test and the issue posted in the GitHub.
