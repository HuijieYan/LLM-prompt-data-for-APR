1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the `markers.MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. The function is responsible for re-initializing the marker attributes when changes are made to the marker style. The GitHub issue relates to setting markers to be hollow, but the fillstyle parameter is not working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is with the `_filled` attribute being set to True by default, which is likely overriding the fillstyle parameter.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the `_recache` function is called, it sets the `_filled` attribute to True, regardless of the fillstyle parameter that may have been set. This overrides the fillstyle and results in the markers not being hollow as intended by the user in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` function to check the fillstyle parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Remove the unnecessary call to `_marker_function()` in the `_recache` function, as it may not be required for the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() != 'full':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
```

This corrected code checks the fillstyle parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Additionally, the unnecessary call to `_marker_function()` has been removed. This should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
