The problem in the provided function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the `self._fillstyle` value.

The GitHub issue reports that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function is always setting `self._filled` to `True`, which contradicts the intended behavior of having hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix the bug, we should set `self._filled` to `False` only when `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code ensures that `self._filled` is only set to `True` when `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`, which aligns with the intended behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
