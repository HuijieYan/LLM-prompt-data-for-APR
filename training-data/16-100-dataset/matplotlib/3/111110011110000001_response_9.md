Potential error location: The error is likely due to the `_filled` attribute not being properly set within the `_recache` function. This attribute is used to determine if the marker is filled or not.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function does not properly set the `_filled` attribute to determine if the marker is filled or not.
(b). The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but it is returning `True` instead of `False`.
(c). The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Set the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` class constructor.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

This correction includes setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` class constructor. This change should ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct result and passes the failing test.
