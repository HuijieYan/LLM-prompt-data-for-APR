Analysis:
The buggy function is _recache() within the MarkerStyle class. The failing test test_marker_fillstyle() is trying to test the fillstyle of a marker, and it's using the is_filled() method to verify that the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True when it should be returning False, causing the test to fail.

Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the _marker_function() method being called without checking for its return value. It seems that the _marker_function() method is responsible for determining whether the marker should be filled or not, but the result is not being used to set the correct value for the is_filled() attribute.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct value for is_filled() is set based on the result of the _marker_function(). Additionally, if the _marker_function() is responsible for determining the filling of the marker, we should make sure that it is called with the necessary parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()  # Set filled based on marker function
```

With this correction, the _filled attribute is set based on the result of the _marker_function(), ensuring that the is_filled() method returns the correct value. The corrected code should pass the failing test.
