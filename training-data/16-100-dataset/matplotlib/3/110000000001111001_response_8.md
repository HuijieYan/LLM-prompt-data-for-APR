The issue with the buggy function is that it is not setting the correct value for the `_filled` variable. The expected value for `_filled` is `True`, but the buggy function is setting it to `False`.

To fix this, we need to update the value of `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
