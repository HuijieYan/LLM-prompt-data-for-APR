The buggy function is the `_recache` function. This function resets several attributes to default values if the `_marker_function` is not `None`, and then calls the `_marker_function`.

The failing test is `test_marker_fillstyle`, which checks if a marker style with fill style `'none'` is not filled.

The error message indicates that `marker_style.is_filled()` is returning `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set to `True` as expected.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are:
- `_filled` is expected to be `True`, but it is `False` in the actual output.
- The `self._filled` variable is being set to `False` in the `_recache` function but should be set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `True` after resetting the attributes in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set `_filled` to `True` and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
