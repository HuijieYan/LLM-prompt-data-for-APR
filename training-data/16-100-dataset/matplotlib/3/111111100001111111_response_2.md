1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib/markers.py` file. This function is intended to reset properties of the marker style. The issue reported on GitHub involves setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' when using `ax.scatter()`, but not getting the expected hollow markers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` which seems to be called unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` property when resetting the marker style properties. The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker should be hollow. This discrepancy is causing the markers to not appear hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the value of `self._fillstyle` and only calling `self._marker_function()` if it is not set to 'none'.
   - Adjusting the logic of the function to properly handle the `fillstyle` property.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now checks the value of `self._fillstyle` and only calls `self._marker_function()` if it is not set to 'none', which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
