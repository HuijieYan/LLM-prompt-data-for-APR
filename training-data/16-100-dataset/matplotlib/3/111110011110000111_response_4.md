1. The buggy function is a method of the MarkerStyle class. It is intended to recache the MarkerStyle attributes based on the marker function. The failing test is checking if the marker's fillstyle is 'none' and whether the marker is filled or not. The error message indicates that the marker is still considered filled even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The GitHub issue describes the same problem in a real-world scenario.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the _marker_function() call. It seems that this function is not properly updating the fillstyle based on the provided marker style.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not properly updating the fillstyle when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is not effectively handling the fillstyle parameter.
   (c). The failing test is checking the filled status based on the fillstyle set to 'none', but the MarkerStyle is still considered filled.
   (d). The GitHub issue reflects the real-world usage of MarkerStyle with a specific fillstyle, but the marker is not displaying as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the buggy function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and update the filled status accordingly.
   - Ensure that the marker function (_marker_function) correctly takes into account the fillstyle parameter.
   - Update the MarkerStyle class to handle the fillstyle parameter appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache method to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and update the filled status, this corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the failing test passes. Additionally, it should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
