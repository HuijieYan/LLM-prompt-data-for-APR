The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, even though the value of `self._fillstyle` may not be `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will check the value of `self._fillstyle` and update the `_filled` variable accordingly, which will address the failing test case.

The corrected function ensures that the `_filled` variable matches the expected value in the failing test by taking into account the value of `self._fillstyle`.
