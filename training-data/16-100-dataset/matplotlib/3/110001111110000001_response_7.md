The problematic function _recache(self) in lib/matplotlib/markers.py is responsible for setting default values and calling the marker function. 

The failing test function test_marker_fillstyle in lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py is failing because the is_filled() method is not returning the expected result.

The error message indicates that the assertion assert not marker_style.is_filled() is failing because marker_style.is_filled() is returning True, when it should be returning False.

The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is not properly setting the value of self._filled. As a result, marker_style.is_filled() is returning True by default.

To fix this bug, we need to set the value of self._filled to False in the _recache function.

Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # set _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
