Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the _recache function in the markers.py file, particularly with the _filled attribute being set to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter being set to 'none'.

Bug's Cause:
The _recache function is resetting the _filled attribute to True, which is conflicting with the user's input to make the marker hollow using fillstyle='none'. This is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and update the _filled attribute accordingly.
2. Ensure that the _recache function takes into account the user's input for fillstyle and applies it to the marker.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional statement to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled is set to False, otherwise, it is set to True. This change allows the user's input for fillstyle to be correctly applied to the marker, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
