The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with a specified marker and fillstyle, then check if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and if the marker is not filled.

The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function` without checking if it exists. This is causing the failing test to also fail, as the `is_filled` function is not being properly set.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the line `self._marker_function()` from the `_recache` function or check if it exists before calling it. This will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object is properly configured.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
```

With this change, the failing test should pass as the `MarkerStyle` object will be properly configured when created.
