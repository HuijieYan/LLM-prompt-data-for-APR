The issue arises because the _recache function is not correctly updating the self._filled variable. This causes the markers to not appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, the _recache function needs to correctly update the self._filled variable based on the value of self._fillstyle.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly update the self._filled variable based on the value of self._fillstyle. This will ensure that the markers appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The corrected code also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub description.
