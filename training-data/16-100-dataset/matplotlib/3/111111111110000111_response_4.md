1. The buggy function is the `_recache` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. It is called after the marker style is changed and updates the internal state of the object. The failing test is testing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which should return `False` when the marker style is set to hollow (`fillstyle='none'`). The GitHub issue is reporting that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` to make the marker hollow. This causes the failing test to fail and also results in the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug is caused by the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `True` within the `_recache` method. The code in the GitHub issue is setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` in an attempt to make the markers hollow, but the `_recache` method is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the `_recache` method to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.
   - Adding a condition that checks if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and setting `_filled` to `False` in that case.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
            self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False for hollow markers
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle`, allowing the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This will address the failing test and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
