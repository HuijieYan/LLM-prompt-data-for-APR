The issue in the buggy function is that the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it's `None`. This causes the error in the failing test because the `is_filled` method is not being correctly defined in the `MarkerStyle` class due to the improper invocation of `_marker_function` in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, and we also need to define the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
