The problem is that the `_filled` attribute is not being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, causing the test to fail when checking if the marker is filled or not.

To fix this issue, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `True` at the end of the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `True` after the function has been called, which will fix the failing test.
