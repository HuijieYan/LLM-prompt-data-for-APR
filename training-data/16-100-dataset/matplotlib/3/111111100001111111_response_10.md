The issue lies in the way the `_filled` variable is being set in the `_recache` function. The expected behavior is that when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker should be hollow. However, the current implementation of the `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`.

To fix this, we can update the `_recache` function to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

This change will ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow, which aligns with the user's expected behavior. This fix also resolves the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` did not result in hollow markers.
