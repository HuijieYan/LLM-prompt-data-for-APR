1. The buggy function is designed to recache various attributes of a marker including the fillstyle, transform, alt_path, snap_threshold, joinstyle, capstyle, and filled attribute. The failing test is checking for the is_filled function of the MarkerStyle class, which is related to the filled attribute being set correctly. The error message indicates that the is_filled function is returning True when it should not be, which suggests that the filled attribute is not being properly set when the marker is created with the fillstyle 'none'. The GitHub issue further confirms that the usage of fillstyle='none' is not producing the expected result of hollow markers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the setting of the filled attribute to True by default, which is not being overridden when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

3. The bug's cause is:
   (a). The buggy function does not properly handle the case when the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in the filled attribute not being properly updated.
   (b). The failing test and error message indicate that the is_filled function is returning True when it should not be, which suggests that the filled attribute is not being properly set.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that the usage of fillstyle='none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to properly handle the case when the fillstyle is set to 'none' and ensure that the filled attribute is set accordingly.
   - Modify the MarkerStyle class to handle the fillstyle 'none' case and update the filled attribute appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if the fillstyle is 'none' and update the filled attribute
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the _recache function now properly updates the filled attribute based on the fillstyle, ensuring that markers created with fillstyle 'none' will have hollow markers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and also make the failing test pass.
