1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It is responsible for re-calculating the marker shape, and it is called when the marker needs to be re-rendered. The GitHub issue reports that setting the `fillstyle` parameter of `markers.MarkerStyle` to 'none' does not result in a hollow marker when used with `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._marker_function()` because it seems to be a placeholder for the actual function that should be called to update the marker's properties.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` attribute is not being properly set or called, which leads to the marker's properties not being updated correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the implementation of the `_marker_function` attribute to ensure it is correctly updating the marker's properties.
   - Setting the correct function to `_marker_function` that properly updates the marker's properties when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled property based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()  # Call the correct marker function
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle` and call the correct marker function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved.
