1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. It is responsible for resetting several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object and calling the `_marker_function` if it is not None. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to check if the `MarkerStyle` object has been filled or not, and it fails with the error message stating that `assert not True`. The GitHub issue also complains about markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none' using `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` line in the failing test. This suggests that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` due to the `'none'` fillstyle.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the `_recache` function not properly resetting the fillstyle attribute when setting it to 'none'. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when it should return `False`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_recache` function to properly handle the 'none' fillstyle and set the filled attribute to `False` when fillstyle is 'none'.
   - Ensure that the `_recache` function correctly resets all attributes based on the fillstyle.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly handle the 'none' fillstyle and set the filled attribute to `False` when fillstyle is 'none, the code addresses the issue and should now pass the failing test and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
