Based on the information provided, the bug is likely caused by the `_filled` variable being set to `False` in the `_recache` function, while it should be set to `True`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should return `True` according to the failing test and the expected input/output variable information.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` in the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Set _filled to True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should now return `True` as expected, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the issue reported in the GitHub post should also be resolved.
