The buggy function is within the MarkerStyle class and is named _recache. The function is supposed to update the marker style parameters, but it has several issues.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(), because it is trying to call a function without checking if it exists first.

The bug's cause is that the function is trying to call self._marker_function without checking if it's already assigned a value. This can lead to an AttributeError if self._marker_function is None.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
