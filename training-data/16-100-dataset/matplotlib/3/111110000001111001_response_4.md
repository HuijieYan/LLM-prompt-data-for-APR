The bug in the function seems to be that the _filled attribute is being set to True unconditionally, even when it should remain unchanged. The original intention may have been to set _filled to True only if it was currently False, but the logic is missing.

To fix the bug, we should check the current value of self._filled before assigning it. If it's already True, then it should remain unchanged. If it's False, then it should be updated to True.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled == False:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
