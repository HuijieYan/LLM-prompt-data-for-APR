The problem in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `False` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the failing test because the `is_filled` method checks for the value of `self._filled`.

To fix this, the `_recache` function needs to set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method should now return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.

This fixes the bug and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post about markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
