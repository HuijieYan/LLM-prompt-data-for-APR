The potential error location within the problematic function is in the assignment of `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method does not return the expected value due to the `_filled` variable being mistakenly set to `False`. This causes the failing test to assert `not True` which results in an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the assignment of `self._filled` should be changed to `True` instead of `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Changed from False to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
