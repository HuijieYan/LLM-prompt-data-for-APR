The buggy function is supposed to perform some operations and call a marker function if it exists. However, it incorrectly sets the value of `_filled` to `False` instead of the expected `True`. This is a potential error location within the problematic function based on the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the assignment to `_filled` to set it to `True` as expected. This will ensure that the value of `_filled` matches the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly set the value of `_filled` to `True` as expected, satisfying the provided expected input/output variable information.
