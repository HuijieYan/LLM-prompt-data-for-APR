1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The function is supposed to update the marker style parameters, but it seems to be setting the `filled` parameter to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is not being updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `_filled` parameter is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method. This means that even if the `fillstyle` is set to `none`, the marker will still be filled.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` method to update the `_filled` parameter based on the `fillstyle` input.
   - Add a conditional statement in the `_recache` method to set `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method will now correctly set the `_filled` parameter based on the `fillstyle` input, allowing markers to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.
