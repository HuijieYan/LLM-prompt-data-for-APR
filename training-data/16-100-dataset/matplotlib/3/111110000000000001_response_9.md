1. The buggy function is a part of the MarkerStyle class. It is intended to recache the marker style based on some conditions. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` as it is trying to call a method without checking if it exists.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function is trying to call a method `_marker_function` without checking if it exists, which could lead to a AttributeError if the method is not defined.
   (b). The buggy class seems to be intended for defining marker styles and handling their recaching.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `_marker_function` exists before calling it within the `_recache` method.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, before calling the `_marker_function`, we added a check to ensure that it is not None and is callable. This will prevent any AttributeError caused by calling a non-existent or non-callable method.
