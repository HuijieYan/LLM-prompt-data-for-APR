The issue with the buggy function lies in the fact that it sets `_filled` to `False` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return `False` when it should be returning `True` because `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this, we need to update the `_recache` method to set `_filled` to `False` only if `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, we should set `_filled` to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_recache` method will correctly set `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. This should make the failing test pass and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Please note that the corrected function relies on the assumption that there is a variable named `self._fillstyle` within the class `MarkerStyle` that holds the style of the marker fill. If this variable has a different name in the actual implementation, it should be adjusted accordingly.
