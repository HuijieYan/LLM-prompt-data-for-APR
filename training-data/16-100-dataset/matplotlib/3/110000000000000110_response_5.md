# The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` has been changed to `if self._marker_function is not None:` to ensure that the function is called if it is not None.
