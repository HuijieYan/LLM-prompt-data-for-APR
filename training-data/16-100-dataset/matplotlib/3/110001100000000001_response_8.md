1. The buggy function is a part of the markers.py file in the matplotlib library and is responsible for recaching marker properties. It seems that the issue lies in the resetting of properties without proper validation or re-initialization of the _marker_function.

2. The potential error location is in the line where self._marker_function() is called without any checks or validation.

3. The bug's cause is that the _marker_function might not be properly reset or re-initialized after resetting the properties in the _recache function. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding a check to ensure that _marker_function is not None before calling it
   - Re-initializing _marker_function after resetting the properties to ensure it is properly set up for future use
   - Adding error handling to the _marker_function to handle any potential issues that may arise

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, a check has been added to ensure that _marker_function is not None before calling it. This will prevent any potential errors that may arise from calling a None object.
