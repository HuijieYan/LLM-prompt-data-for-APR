The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects `marker_style.is_filled()` to return False when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the buggy function sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle`.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` variable is incorrectly set to `True`, which is not consistent with the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set based on the input `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set the `_filled` variable based on the input `fillstyle` parameter, and it will pass the failing test. Additionally, it will also resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
