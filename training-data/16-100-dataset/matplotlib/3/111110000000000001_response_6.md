1. The buggy function _recache is a method of the class MarkerStyle. It is responsible for reinitializing certain attributes of the MarkerStyle class based on the current state of the _marker_function attribute.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line that calls self._marker_function(). If _marker_function is not properly initialized or does not exist, this line will cause an AttributeError.

3. (a). The buggy function attempts to call a method _marker_function without properly checking if it exists or is initialized.
   (b). The buggy class MarkerStyle does not initialize the _marker_function attribute, which can lead to the function being called with a None value.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check for the existence of _marker_function before calling it in the _recache method. Additionally, we should ensure that _marker_function is properly initialized when creating an instance of MarkerStyle.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker_function=None):
        self._marker_function = marker_function

    # the fixed _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, we added an argument to the MarkerStyle constructor to initialize the _marker_function attribute. Then, in the _recache function, we added a check to see if _marker_function is not None before calling it. This approach prevents the AttributeError that would occur if _marker_function is not initialized.
