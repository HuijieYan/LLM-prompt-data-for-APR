1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related functions, test code, and corresponding error message, as well as the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem lies within the MarkerStyle class in the markers module of matplotlib. The failing test is specifically related to setting the fillstyle of a marker to 'none' and checking if it is filled or not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _recache() method where it sets the _filled attribute to True regardless of the fillstyle.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a). The buggy function _recache() is called when initializing a MarkerStyle object.
   (b). The failing test marker_style.is_filled() fails because the _recache() method sets _filled to True, regardless of the fillstyle being set to 'none'.
   (c). The error message indicates that the is_filled() method returns True, while it should return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
   (d). The GitHub issue also confirms the discrepancy in achieving hollow markers when setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the _recache() method to properly handle the fillstyle and set the _filled attribute accordingly.
   - Updating the MarkerStyle class to correctly reflect the fillstyle option when rendering the markers.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function _recache():

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache() method now properly handles the fillstyle and sets the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle option. This should ensure that the MarkerStyle class behaves as expected, and the failing test should now pass. The issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved, as the markers will now render as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
