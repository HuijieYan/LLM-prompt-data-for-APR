1. The buggy function is `_recache` in the `markers.py` file. This function is responsible for updating the marker style properties. The failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a MarkerStyle object with a specific fillstyle and checks if it's filled or not. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning True when it should be returning False. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of `_filled = True`. This means that regardless of the `fillstyle` set for the MarkerStyle, it is always marked as filled.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` property in the `_recache` function is being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This leads to the `is_filled()` method always returning `True` for any marker style.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` property based on the specified `fillstyle`.
   - Ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `_filled` property.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is specified and not 'none'
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `is_filled()` method should return the appropriate value based on the specified `fillstyle`. This will ensure that setting `fillstyle` to 'none' results in hollow markers as expected. The corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
