1. The buggy function _recache() in markers.py is responsible for recaching marker properties. The issue on GitHub is related to setting markers hollow using markers.MarkerStyle(fillstyle='none') in matplotlib. The code provided in the GitHub issue attempts to create a custom marker style with the fillstyle set to 'none' and use it in the scatter plot, but it does not produce the expected result.

2. The potential error location within the _recache() function is the line "self._marker_function()". This line tries to call a marker function, but it is not properly defined or assigned.

3. The bug's cause is that the _marker_function is not properly defined or assigned, which leads to incorrect handling of the fillstyle when creating a custom marker style. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   - Checking the definition and assignment of _marker_function to ensure it is properly implemented.
   - Verifying the behavior of setting fillstyle='none' when creating a custom marker style.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Fixed condition to check for existence of marker function
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to create hollow markers
        # No need to call _marker_function() as it is not used or defined in this context
```

This corrected code for the _recache() function sets the filled property to False to create hollow markers. It removes the unnecessary call to _marker_function() as it is not used or defined in this context. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected result of having hollow markers when using markers.MarkerStyle(fillstyle='none').
