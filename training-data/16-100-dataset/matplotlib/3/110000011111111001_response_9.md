The issue in the buggy function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `False` unconditionally, which causes the failing test since `is_filled` method checks if `_filled` is `True`. 

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` value. If `self._fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function will set the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` value, and the failing test should pass.
