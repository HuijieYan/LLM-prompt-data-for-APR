The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting self._filled to True, instead of using the value from self._fillstyle. This is causing the failing test because the is_filled() method is returning True, when it should be returning False based on the fillstyle of 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the _recache function to use the value of self._fillstyle to set the self._filled variable.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the _recache function will use the correct value from self._fillstyle to set the self._filled variable, and the failing test should pass.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and will pass the failing test.
