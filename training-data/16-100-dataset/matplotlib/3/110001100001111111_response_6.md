The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not working as expected when using the markers.MarkerStyle() class.

Looking at the `_recache` function, it seems that the `self._filled` variable is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This means that even if `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will still be filled.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the `_filled` variable is being set without considering the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved and the markers should behave as expected.
