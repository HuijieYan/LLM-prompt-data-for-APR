Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is at the line `self._marker_function()`. This is because the `self._marker_function` is being called without first checking if it exists, which can lead to a AttributeError.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset marker attributes, but it also calls `self._marker_function` without checking if it exists. This causes the failing test as it tries to call the `is_filled` method on the `_marker_function` which does not exist, resulting in an AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid the AttributeError.
2. Add a condition to ensure that `self._marker_function` is called only when it is not `None`.

Corrected Code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With the above corrected code, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and not throw an AttributeError.
