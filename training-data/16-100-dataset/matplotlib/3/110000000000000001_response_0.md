1. The buggy function is intended to reset several attributes of an object. However, it appears to be missing an attribute assignment for self._marker_function, which could potentially cause an error.

2. The potential error location is within the if statement checking if self._marker_function is None. If self._marker_function is not assigned, then calling it as a function at the end of the method could result in a AttributeError.

3. The bug is caused by the function not properly checking if self._marker_function has been assigned before trying to call it as a function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adding a check to see if self._marker_function is not None before calling it as a function or assigning a default function to self._marker_function if it is None.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
