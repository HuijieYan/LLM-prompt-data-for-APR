The potential error location in the problematic function is the line self._filled = True, as it is setting the _filled attribute to True unconditionally.

The bug's cause is that the _filled attribute is set to True regardless of the value of self._fillstyle. Additionally, the failing test is checking whether the marker is filled or not, based on the fillstyle.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _recache function to consider the value of self._fillstyle when setting the self._filled attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the _recache function to check the value of self._fillstyle and set self._filled accordingly.
2. Add a condition to check if self._fillstyle is 'none', then set self._filled to False, otherwise set it to True.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the expected input/output variable information should also be satisfied. Additionally, it will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
