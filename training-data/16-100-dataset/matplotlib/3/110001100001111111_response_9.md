The potential error location within the problematic function is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` regardless of the input parameter `self._fillstyle`. This is causing the markers to always be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.`

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is not being set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which is leading to markers being filled even when the intention is to have hollow markers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` will be set to `False`, ensuring that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report, and the `ax.scatter()` function should now render hollow markers when using a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle` set to `'none'.
