1. The function _recache is intended to reset several attributes to default values and then call the _marker_function if it is not None.

2. The potential error location is when the function self._marker_function() is called. If self._marker_function is not defined, then calling it will result in an AttributeError.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not check if self._marker_function is defined before calling it.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if self._marker_function is defined before calling it.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
