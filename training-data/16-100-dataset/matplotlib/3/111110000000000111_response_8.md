1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and it is responsible for recalculating the marker style whenever a change is made. The GitHub issue pertains to the inability to create hollow markers using the fillstyle parameter in the MarkerStyle class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _marker_function() is called. This function is expected to recalculate the marker style, but it is not properly implemented to handle the fillstyle parameter.

3. The bug is caused by the incomplete implementation of the _marker_function() within the MarkerStyle class. The _recache function initializes various internal variables, but the actual recalculation of the marker style does not properly handle the fillstyle parameter. This leads to the issue described in the GitHub problem statement, where setting fillstyle='none' does not result in hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the _marker_function() to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that it correctly creates hollow markers when fillstyle='none' is set.
   - Check if the _marker_function() is being properly triggered when fillstyle is set and ensure that the necessary changes are applied to create hollow markers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False

        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check for the fillstyle parameter within the _recache function and appropriately setting the _filled variable based on the fillstyle value, the issue described in the GitHub problem statement should be resolved.
