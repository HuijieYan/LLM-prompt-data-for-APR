Potential error location: The _marker_function() is being called without checking if it exists, which could result in a runtime error.

Bug's cause: The _marker_function() is being called without any check for its existence, and it is assumed to exist without validation.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the _marker_function exists before calling it.
2. Add a condition to validate if the _marker_function exists before execution.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
