1. The function _recache is responsible for reinitializing the marker's attributes. It seems to be calling a marker function that is not defined within the given code snippet. The function should reset the marker to its default state.

2. The potential error location is the function call self._marker_function(), as it is not defined within the given code snippet.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is attempting to call a marker function that is not defined within the given code snippet. This is evident from the if statement checking for the existence of self._marker_function, suggesting that it is a required function for the marker to be properly cached.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Define the marker function that is being called within the _recache function.
   b. If the marker function is not applicable, remove the call to self._marker_function() and ensure that all other attributes are properly reset.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected code, the if statement has been modified to check for the existence of self._marker_function before calling it. This ensures that the function is only called if it is defined.
