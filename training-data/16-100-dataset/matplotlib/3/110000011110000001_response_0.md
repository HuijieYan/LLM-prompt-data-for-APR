1. The `_recache` function is called when a marker style is modified in matplotlib. It resets several attributes and then calls the `_marker_function` to notify the parent artist that the marker style has changed.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the call to `_marker_function()` at the end of the function. This function is expecting an update to the marker style, but it may not be correctly updating the filled attribute.

3. The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class not returning the expected value. This could be due to the incorrect handling of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method, which is called when the marker style is changed.

4. To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should correctly update the `_filled` attribute to reflect the actual fillstyle and then call the `_marker_function()`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False  # update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction updates the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle and should ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value. This updated code should pass the failing test.
