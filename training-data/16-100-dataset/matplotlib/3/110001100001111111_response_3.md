The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `fillstyle`, which should ensure that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

This correction resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post, where markers were not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
