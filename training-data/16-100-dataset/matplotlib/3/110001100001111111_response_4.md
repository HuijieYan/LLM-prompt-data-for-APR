The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function. This is incorrect behavior, as the `_filled` attribute should be based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the marker.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Set _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` attribute, allowing markers to be correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub problem description regarding markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'.
