# The buggy function is located in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library.
# The function is related to setting the properties of markers in a plot, such as shape, transformation, fill, etc.
# The GitHub issue indicates that when using the markers.MarkerStyle and setting the parameter fillstyle='none', the markers are not displayed as hollow as expected.

The potential error within the _recache function is that the _marker_function() is being called, which might be overriding the fillstyle='none' settings. 

Based on the analysis of the function and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug seems to be that the _recache function is not correctly handling the fillstyle='none' setting for markers.

To fix the bug, the _recache function should be modified to ensure that the fillstyle setting is properly applied and does not get overwritten by any other functions called within _recache.

Here is the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # set filled to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled property to False, the markers will now be displayed as hollow when using markers.MarkerStyle and setting fillstyle='none', resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
