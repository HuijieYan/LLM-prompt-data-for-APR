1. The buggy function is not directly related to the GitHub issue, but it seems to be a part of the larger codebase of a library or application that includes marker functionality. The GitHub issue is related to markers not appearing as hollow when the fill style is set to 'none'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the way the marker function is being called or in the other properties being set within the function.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The problematic function `_recache` is setting various properties including the marker function, but it doesn't seem to directly relate to the issue described in the GitHub post.
   (b). The GitHub issue describes an issue with markers not appearing as hollow when the fill style is set to 'none'. This seems to be related to how markers are being created and rendered, rather than the internal recaching of properties.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the code related to markers, especially the MarkerStyle class and the way markers are being filled and rendered.
   - Check if there are any overrides or customizations affecting the marker rendering behavior.
   - Ensure that the fill style 'none' is being properly interpreted and applied to markers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, I have added a check to ensure that the marker function is not None before calling it, which could prevent any unexpected behavior related to markers. However, this may not directly address the issue described in the GitHub post, as the problem seems to be related to marker rendering rather than the internal recaching of properties.
