The issue with the _recache function is that it is not setting the self._filled variable correctly. In the expected case 1, self._filled should be set to True, but the buggy function is not doing that. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix this bug, we need to update the buggy function to correctly set self._filled to True. Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Corrected line
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly set the self._filled variable to True, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
