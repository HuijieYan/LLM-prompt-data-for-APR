1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the matplotlib library, which is used for creating and customizing markers for scatter plots. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers as hollow using the fillstyle parameter, which is not working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the _filled attribute. Setting it to True by default might be causing the markers to appear filled instead of hollow when the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none'.

3. (a). The buggy function:
The _recache function initializes the MarkerStyle attributes and calls the _marker_function. The issue might be related to the _filled attribute causing the markers to appear filled even when fillstyle is set to 'none'.
(b). The buggy class:
The MarkerStyle class is used for customizing marker properties for scatter plots, including the fillstyle parameter that is supposed to control whether markers are filled or hollow.
(c). The GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue describes a situation where the fillstyle parameter is being set to 'none' to make markers hollow, but it's not working as expected when using ax.scatter() with a custom MarkerStyle.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that markers are displayed as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.
   - Check if any other attributes or parameters in the MarkerStyle class are conflicting with the fillstyle parameter and causing the issue.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # the corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False to make markers hollow when fillstyle is 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected code, the MarkerStyle class will correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that markers appear as hollow when fillstyle is is set to 'none', resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
