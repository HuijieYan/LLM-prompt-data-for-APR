1. The buggy function appears to be related to the markers in the matplotlib library. The GitHub issue mentions a problem with marker styling, particularly when trying to create hollow markers using a custom 'MarkerStyle' with the fillstyle parameter set to 'none'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of the '_filled' attribute to True, which conflicts with the intention of creating hollow markers.

3. The bug's cause is that the '_filled' attribute is set to True by default in the buggy function, which contradicts the intention of creating hollow markers as described in the GitHub issue. This means that the code is not correctly handling the 'fillstyle' parameter when creating custom markers.

4. To fix the bug, we can update the '_recache' function to properly handle the 'fillstyle' parameter and ensure that it affects the marker's appearance as intended. This may involve checking the value of 'fillstyle' and updating the '_filled' attribute accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the '_filled' attribute is now being properly updated based on the 'fillstyle' parameter. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow for the creation of hollow markers when using custom 'MarkerStyle'.
