The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the marker to always be filled, even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the markers should now be hollow when `ax.scatter()` is used and `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This fix also aligns with the expected variable values provided in the failing test cases.

This corrected code should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
