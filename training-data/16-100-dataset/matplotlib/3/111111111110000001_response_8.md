The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(). This line is calling a method without defining it within the class. This is causing the failing test to return an assertion error as it is unable to properly evaluate marker_style.is_filled().

The bug's cause is the missing definition of the _marker_function method within the MarkerStyle class. This method is being called without being properly defined, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to define the _marker_function method within the MarkerStyle class and ensure that it returns the correct value for is_filled. This will allow the failing test to pass.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function = self._is_filled  # Define the _marker_function
        self._marker_function()  # Call the _marker_function

    def _is_filled(self):  # Define the _is_filled method
        return self._filled

    # Rest of the class definition

```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass as the _marker_function is now properly defined and returns the correct value for is_filled.
