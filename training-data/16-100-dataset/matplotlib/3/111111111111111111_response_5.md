The bug is located in the _recache function of the MarkerStyle class. The failing test is due to the is_filled function not returning the expected value when the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none'.

The cause of the bug is that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled variable is still being set to True. This is causing the is_filled function to return True when it should be returning False.

To fix the bug, the _filled variable should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none'.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check if fillstyle is not 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With the above change, the _recache function should now correctly update the _filled variable based on the fillstyle parameter.

This change will cause the failing test to pass and will also correct the issue reported in the GitHub post.
