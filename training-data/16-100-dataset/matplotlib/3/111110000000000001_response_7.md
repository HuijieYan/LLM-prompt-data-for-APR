The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is responsible for re-caching the marker style attributes. The potential error within the function is the call to self._marker_function() without properly checking if it exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where self._marker_function is None. This can lead to a potential AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will only call self._marker_function if it is not None, avoiding the potential AttributeError.
