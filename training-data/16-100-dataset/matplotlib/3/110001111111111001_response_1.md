The issue in the provided function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` value. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass as expected.

Additionally, the expected value and type of variables provided in the prompt have been satisfied by this correction.
