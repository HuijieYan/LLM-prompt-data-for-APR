The buggy function `_recache` is being called to reinitialize attributes of an object, and it should call the `_marker_function` method if it's not `None`. However, it seems that the `_marker_function` is not working as expected, leading to the failing test and the error message.

The failing test is checking if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`, but the error message shows that it's returning `True`, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the `_recache` function could be in the line:
```
self._marker_function()
```
This is where the method is called, and it seems to be returning unexpected values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_marker_function` method is correctly implemented and returns the expected values for the attributes it's setting. Additionally, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, and it sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. This should ensure that the failing test will pass.
