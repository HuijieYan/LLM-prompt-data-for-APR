The bug in the function `_recache` is that it is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, rather than based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not take into account the `self._fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` variable. This causes it to always be `True`, regardless of the input value.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow.

The corrected code for the `_recache` function is as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass, and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
