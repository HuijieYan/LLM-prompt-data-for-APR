The buggy function _recache is intended to reset the marker style properties to default values when called. However, the issue seems to be with the line self._marker_function(), as this is not defined within the function and is likely causing the error in the failing test.

The failing test specifically checks the is_filled method of the MarkerStyle class, which is expected to return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. However, the error message indicates that the is_filled method is returning True, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the _recache function should not be calling a non-existent _marker_function. Instead, it should reset the marker style properties as intended. 

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass as the marker style properties are properly reset, and the is_filled method should return the expected value.
