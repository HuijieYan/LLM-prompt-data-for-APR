1. The buggy function is not directly related to the GitHub issue, as the issue is about markers not being hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle's fillstyle to 'none'. However, the buggy function may indirectly relate to this issue if it is used in the code that handles marker styling or transformations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line below:
   ```python
   self._marker_function()
   ```
   This is where the function attempts to call self._marker_function without checking if it exists, which could lead to an error.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle a situation where self._marker_function may be None.
   (b). The GitHub issue points to the fact that markers are not appearing as hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none', which is different from the functionality expected when using the MarkerStyle parameter.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Add a check to verify if self._marker_function exists before calling it in the _recache function to prevent potential errors.
   (b). Investigate the marker styling issue in the code that handles the visualization and verify the correct implementation of the markers.MarkerStyle.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # check if self._marker_function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
By adding a check for the existence of self._marker_function, potential errors will be prevented. However, this correction may not directly resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report, as it pertains to marker styling and visualization. Further investigation and potential modifications in the marker styling code may be required to address the issue.
