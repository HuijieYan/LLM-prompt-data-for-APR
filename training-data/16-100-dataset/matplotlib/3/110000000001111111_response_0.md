The issue stems from the fact that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which means that even if the marker's `fillstyle` is set to `none`, it will still be filled. This is why the markers are not hollow as expected.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute. We can do this by setting `_filled` to `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `none`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    # Check if fillstyle is 'none' and update _filled accordingly
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged 
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

This update will ensure that when the marker's `fillstyle` is set to `none`, it will indeed appear as hollow.

Additionally, the GitHub issue title and description provide insight into the specific use case where this bug is causing problems, highlighting the need for markers to be hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.

By addressing the conditional setting of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we can ensure that the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.

With this correction, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the markers should appear hollow when using the specified method and parameters.
