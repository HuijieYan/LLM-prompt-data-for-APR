The issue with the `_recache` function is that it is setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the value of `_fillstyle`. The function should check the value of `_fillstyle` and only set `_filled` to `True` if it is not `'none'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will only be set to `True` if the `_fillstyle` is not `'none', as expected in the failing tests. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as intended.
