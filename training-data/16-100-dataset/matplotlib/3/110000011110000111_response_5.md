1. The function `_recache` is responsible for resetting some attributes to their default values and then calling the `_marker_function`. The failing test is related to the `MarkerStyle` class, which has a method `is_filled` that returns whether the marker is filled or not. The error message indicates that `marker_style.is_filled()` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`, which is setting the marker to be filled by default. This is likely the cause of the failing test and the GitHub issue.

3. The cause of the bug can be identified as follows:
   (a). The `_recache` function is setting `self._filled` to `True` by default, which contradicts the expected behavior of setting `fillstyle='none'` to make the marker hollow.
   (b). The failing test is trying to check if the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled` method, which is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
   (c). The GitHub issue involves a user trying to create hollow markers using `fillstyle='none'` but not getting the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set `self._filled` accordingly.
   (b). Update the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Change the default value to False for hollow markers
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved, allowing markers to be successfully set as hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
