1. The buggy function is the _recache method of the MarkerStyle class, which is supposed to recache the marker style attributes. The failing test is trying to check if the fillstyle of the marker style is set to 'none' and if the marker is not filled. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True when it should be returning False.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _filled attribute being set to True no matter what the fillstyle is.

3. (a). The buggy function:
The _recache method is not correctly handling the fillstyle attribute.

(b). The buggy class:
The MarkerStyle class is not correctly interpreting the fillstyle attribute and consequently setting the _filled attribute to True regardless of the fillstyle.

(c). The failing test and error message:
The failing test is trying to check if the marker is not filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True when it should be returning False.

(d). The GitHub Issue information:
The user is trying to set markers as hollow using the fillstyle='none' parameter in the MarkerStyle class but is not getting the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The _recache method should check the fillstyle attribute and set the _filled attribute accordingly. Additionally, the is_filled() method should return True or False based on the fillstyle attribute.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With this corrected code, the _recache method now correctly sets the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle, and the is_filled method returns the appropriate value based on the fillstyle attribute. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
