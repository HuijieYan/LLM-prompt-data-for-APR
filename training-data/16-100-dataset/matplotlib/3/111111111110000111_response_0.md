1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is named _recache and it seems to be responsible for updating the marker style parameters. The failing test function is checking if the marker style is filled or not, and the error message indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True when it should be False. The GitHub issue suggests that setting fillstyle to 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function is likely the _filled attribute being set to True, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

3. The bug is caused by the _filled attribute being set to True unconditionally in the _recache function. This causes the is_filled() method to always return True, even when fillstyle is set to 'none'. This behavior is not consistent with the expectations of the failing test and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve modifying the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, the _recache function now checks the fillstyle and sets the _filled attribute accordingly. If fillstyle is 'none', then _filled is set to False, otherwise it is set to True.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue described in the GitHub report should also be resolved.
