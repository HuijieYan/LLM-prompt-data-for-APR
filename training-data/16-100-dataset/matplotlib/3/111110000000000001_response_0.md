1. The buggy function is part of the class MarkerStyle, which seems to be used for defining marker styles. The function _recache is used to recache the marker style properties.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems that this line is trying to call a method or function that doesn't exist or has not been defined within the class.

3. The bug is caused by the attempt to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or has been defined in the class. It seems like there is an assumption that this method exists, but it has not been properly handled.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, the function should gracefully handle this scenario, possibly by raising an error or providing a default behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `_marker_function` attribute exists and is callable before attempting to call it. If it does not exist or is not callable, we prevent the function call to avoid the error.
