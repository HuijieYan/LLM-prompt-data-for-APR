1. The buggy function is a method to recache certain attributes in a class if a marker function is not None.

2. The potential error is that the marker function is being called without any arguments, and we are not checking if it is callable before calling it.

3. The bug's cause is that the marker function is being called without any validation, which can lead to errors if the function is not defined or not callable.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if the marker function is callable before calling it.
   b. Handle the case where the marker function is not defined or is not callable.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# corrected code
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if the marker function is callable before calling it. This will prevent any errors that may occur if the marker function is not defined or not callable.
