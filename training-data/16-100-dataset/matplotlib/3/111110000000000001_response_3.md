Potential error location: The _marker_function is being called without checking if it exists or is initialized.

Bug's cause:
(a). The function _recache is calling _marker_function without checking if it exists or has been initialized, which could lead to an AttributeError.
(b). The class MarkerStyle may not have a valid _marker_function attribute, which can cause the function to fail when it is called.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if _marker_function is not None before calling it.
2. Ensure that MarkerStyle class has a valid _marker_function attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
