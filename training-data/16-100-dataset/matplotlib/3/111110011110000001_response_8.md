The potential error in the function is that the `is_filled` method is not implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, which is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class. This method should return the value of the `_filled` attribute, which determines whether the marker is filled or not.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With the addition of the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class, the failing test should now pass.
