1. The buggy function appears to be a method related to marker styles in the Matplotlib library. The failing test is related to setting marker styles, specifically the fillstyle parameter. The error message indicates that the is_filled() method is not functioning as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to self._marker_function() at the end of the _recache() function. It seems that this function is not properly setting the fillstyle to 'none', resulting in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _recache() sets various attributes related to marker style, but the call to self._marker_function() at the end is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.
   (b). The failing test specifically checks for the fillstyle and whether the marker is filled, indicating that the issue might be related to the fillstyle parameter.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that the fillstyle parameter is not resulting in the expected behavior when creating a custom markers.MarkerStyle.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the implementation of _recache() to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the is_filled() method works as expected.
   - Validate the usage of the fillstyle parameter and its interaction with other attributes within the marker style.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled attribute to False
    else:
        self._filled = True  # Set filled attribute to True
    self._marker_function()
```

The corrected code checks the fillstyle attribute and properly sets the filled attribute based on the fillstyle. This modification should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
