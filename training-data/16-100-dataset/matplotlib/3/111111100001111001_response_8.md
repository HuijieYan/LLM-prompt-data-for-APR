The potential error in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` variable is being set to `False` unconditionally, while it should be based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to set the `_filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, as expected in the failing test cases.
