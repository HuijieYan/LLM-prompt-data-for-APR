1. The buggy function `_recache` is a private method that resets various attributes of an object and then calls the `_marker_function` method if it is not `None`. The failing test checks if a marker style object is filled or not.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to True, which could be causing the `is_filled` method of the marker style object to return True even when it is not expected.

3. The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally, which is causing the failing test to assert `not True`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
   - Check the condition for setting `self._filled` to a value based on the actual filled status of the marker style.
   - Ensure that the `is_fill` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle of the marker.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the actual fillstyle of the marker, and the failing test should now pass.
