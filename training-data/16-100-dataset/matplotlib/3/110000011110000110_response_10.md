```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # fix: use "not" instead of "is None"
        self._path = self._alt_path  # fix: use self._alt_path instead of _empty_path
        self._transform = self._alt_transform  # fix: use self._alt_transform instead of IdentityTransform()
        self._snap_threshold = 0.0  # fix: set snap_threshold to a default value
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # fix: set filled to False as the default behavior for 'none' fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version of the function, the condition for executing the code inside the function is changed from `if self._marker_function is None` to `if self._marker_function is not None`. Additionally, the assignments of `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, and `_filled` are adjusted to set the correct values.=_filled = False is added to set the default behavior for 'none' fillstyle.
