Potential error location: 

The issue appears to be with the `is_filled` method in the failing test. This method is not being properly initialized when the `MarkerStyle` is created.

Bug's cause:

The `MarkerStyle` class is not properly initializing the `_filled` attribute. This is leading to the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

One possible approach is to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` by default in the `MarkerStyle` class and then update it based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` initializer.

Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker, fillstyle):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'
    
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # set to default value
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By initializing the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter and adding the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class, the corrected code should pass the failing test.
