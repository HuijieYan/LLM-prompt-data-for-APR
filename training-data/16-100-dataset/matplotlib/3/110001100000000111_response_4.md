The buggy function _recache() is a method in the markers module of the matplotlib library. This function is responsible for resetting the marker properties to their default values and then calling the marker function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is calling the marker function without checking if it exists or not, which can lead to a AttributeError if the _marker_function is not defined.

The bug's cause, as per the GitHub issue, is that when using markers.MarkerStyle and setting fillstyle='none', the markers are not hollow as expected. This aligns with the potential error location in the _recache() function because it is not handling the fillstyle parameter correctly.

To fix the bug, the _recache() function should check if _marker_function is not None before calling it. Additionally, the function should handle the fillstyle parameter to ensure that markers are hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache() function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache() function checks if _marker_function is not None before calling it and sets the _filled property to False when the fillstyle is 'none', allowing markers to be hollow as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
