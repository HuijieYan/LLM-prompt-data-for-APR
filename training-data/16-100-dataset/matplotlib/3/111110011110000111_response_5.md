1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, and corresponding error message, it seems that the MarkerStyle class is not properly implementing the is_filled() method, which is causing the failing test and the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the is_filled() method of the MarkerStyle class.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _recache in MarkerStyle does not properly reset the _filled attribute to True or False based on the fillstyle parameter.
   (b). The failing test test_marker_fillstyle is expecting marker_style.is_filled() to return False when the fillstyle is set to 'none', but the actual result is True, causing the test to fail.
   (c). The error message indicates that the is_filled method is returning True when it should be False, leading to the AssertionError.
   (d). The GitHub issue also describes the same problem where the user sets the fillstyle to 'none' but does not get hollow markers as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the _recache function to properly update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.
   (b). Update the is_filled() method in the MarkerStyle class to correctly return the value of the _filled attribute.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
        
        fillstyles = ['full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top', 'none']
        if self._fillstyle in fillstyles:
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
