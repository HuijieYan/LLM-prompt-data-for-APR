Analysis:

The problematic function is a method within a class that is responsible for re-caching marker properties. The GitHub issue complains about markers not appearing hollow even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The issue is related to the usage of custom MarkerStyle and the scatter function in Matplotlib.

Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function lies in the _filled attribute being set to True. This could be causing the markers to always appear filled, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

Bug's Cause:
The _filled attribute being set to True in the _recache function is causing the markers to always be filled, even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This leads to the markers not appearing hollow as intended by the user.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled attribute accordingly.
2. Ensure that the _filled attribute reflects the fillstyle set by the user.

Corrected Code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
