The buggy function is a part of the MarkerStyle class, and the issue is related to the markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. The goal is to customize the MarkerStyle and set the fillstyle to 'none' to create hollow markers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior of having hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'`.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle` parameter. This discrepancy causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the conditional for setting `_filled` needs to be modified to consider the value of the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute is only set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none', which should result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none`.
