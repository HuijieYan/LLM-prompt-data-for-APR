The buggy function is expected to set some default values for variables and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the function incorrectly sets the `_filled` variable to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`.

The error occurs in the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```

The bug's cause is that the variable `_filled` is being set to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`.

To fix the bug, the line `self._filled = True` should be corrected to `self._filled = False`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
