Potential error location: The `_filled` variable is being set to `False` unconditionally at the end of the function, which is incorrect.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by unconditionally setting the `_filled` variable to `True` at the end of the function.

Approach for fixing the bug: Remove the line that unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`, and instead set it based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
