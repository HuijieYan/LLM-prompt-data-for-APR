The bug in the _recache function is that it is setting self._filled to True unconditionally, even when the fillstyle is 'none'. This causes the is_filled method to return True instead of False, which leads to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to check the fillstyle before setting self._filled. If the fillstyle is 'none', then self._filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will now correctly set self._filled based on the fillstyle, and the failing test should pass. This change also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository about markers not being hollow when using fillstyle 'none'.

The updated function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
