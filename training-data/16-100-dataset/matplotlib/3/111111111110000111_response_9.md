1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function _recache() is responsible for updating the marker style properties, and it seems that the issue lies in the way the filled property is being set. The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but the assertion fails. The GitHub issue suggests that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the way the _filled property is being set. It is expected to be False when fillstyle is set to 'none', but the current implementation is not achieving this.

3. The bug is likely caused by the way the _filled property is being handled in the _recache() function. The failing test indicates that the is_filled() method is returning True, even though fillstyle is set to 'none' in the MarkerStyle constructor. This implies that the _filled property is not being updated correctly when fillstyle is set to 'none'. The GitHub issue further confirms that the fillstyle 'none' is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled property in MarkerStyle is set to False. This would allow the is_filled() method to correctly indicate that the marker is not filled. Additionally, the _marker_function() called at the end of the _recache() function may also need to be adjusted to properly reflect the fillstyle being set.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and set the _filled property to False when fillstyle is set to 'none'. Additionally, this corrected behavior should also address the issue described in the GitHub post, where setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers as expected.
