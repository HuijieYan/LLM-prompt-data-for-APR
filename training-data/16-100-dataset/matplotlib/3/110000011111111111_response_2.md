The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is incorrectly set to `False` instead of `True` in the `_recache` function, causing the `marker_style.is_filled()` method to return `False` when it is expected to return `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Update _filled to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the updated function should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `True`, resolving the issue where markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'.

This code should also pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
