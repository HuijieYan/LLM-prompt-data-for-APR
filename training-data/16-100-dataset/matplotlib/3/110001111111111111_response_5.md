The issue appears to be with the is_filled() method not returning the expected value, causing the failing test. This is likely due to the _filled attribute not being set to the correct value when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, the _filled attribute should be set to False when fillstyle is 'none' and True otherwise.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. Additionally, this should resolve the issue posted on GitHub about markers not being hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.
