1. The buggy function "_recache" is a method of the class MarkerStyle in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. This function is responsible for re-caching the marker style attributes. The GitHub issue mentions that the markers are not hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting marker.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. This indicates that there is an issue with how the fillstyle attribute is being handled in the _recache function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the fillstyle attribute is not being properly handled, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function does not properly handle the fillstyle attribute, which causes the markers to be filled even when 'none' fillstyle is specified.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is responsible for defining the style of markers, including fillstyle, and the _recache function is used to update the marker style attributes.
   (c). The related functions that use MarkerStyle, such as ax.scatter(), rely on the correct implementation of the MarkerStyle class and its attributes, including fillstyle.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides a code example that demonstrates the incorrect behavior when using MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle attribute and ensure that when fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are hollow.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is set to False, which will result in hollow markers when using MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none'. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
