1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` with a custom marker style where `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, when it should be returning `False`. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This is likely causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `is_filled` method should return `False`, but the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which causes the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` method to check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Update the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter so that the `is_filled` method returns the expected result.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function correctly checks the `fillstyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should make the `is_filled` method behave as expected and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers.
