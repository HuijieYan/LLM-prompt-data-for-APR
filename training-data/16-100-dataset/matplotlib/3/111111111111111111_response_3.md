The issue occurs because the _marker_function is not being properly set to update the _filled property based on the value of the _fillstyle parameter.

To fix this bug, the _marker_function should be updated to correctly set the _filled property based on the _fillstyle parameter. Also, it should be called at the end of the _recache function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()

    # other methods...

```

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, the code snippet provided in the GitHub issue will also work correctly, and the markers will be displayed as hollow shapes as intended.
