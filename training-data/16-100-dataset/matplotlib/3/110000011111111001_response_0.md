The issue with the provided function is that it is setting `self._filled` to True unconditionally, which is causing the failing test. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking that the marker style is not filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic of setting `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the failing test should pass.
