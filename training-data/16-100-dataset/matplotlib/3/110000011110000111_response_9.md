1. From analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the MarkerStyle class that is being used in the test. The failing test is checking whether the marker is filled or not, and it seems that the fillstyle parameter 'none' is not working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the _recache function is likely in the line where the _filled attribute is being set to True. This could be overriding the fillstyle parameter set in the MarkerStyle class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _recache function is setting _filled to True unconditionally, which is causing the MarkerStyle to always appear filled regardless of the fillstyle parameter set.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the _recache function to respect the fillstyle parameter and not override it with _filled = True
   - Updating the MarkerStyle class to handle the fillstyle parameter in a way that it does not get overridden by _recache

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Do not unconditionally set _filled to True
    if self.fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the MarkerStyle class will now respect the fillstyle parameter and not unconditionally set _filled to True. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub, allowing users to create hollow markers when setting fillstyle='none'. The failing test should also pass with this correction.
