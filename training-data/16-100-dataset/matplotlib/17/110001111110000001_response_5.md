The buggy function `nonsingular` modifies the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function takes `vmin` and `vmax` as input, and based on various conditions, it modifies these parameters to avoid singularities. The failing test function `test_colorbar_int` is testing the `fig.colorbar` method and is failing with the error message `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract`.

The potential error in the function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue` using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. It seems that the function is not handling the negative values of `vmin` and `vmax` properly which is causing the overflow error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the way `maxabsvalue` is calculated and handled to ensure that it doesn't cause an overflow.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin) if vmin != 0 else tiny
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax) if vmax != 0 else tiny
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected version, we have handled the negative values of `vmin` and `vmax` properly, and used a small value `tiny` instead of 0 when taking the absolute value, to avoid potential division by zero or overflow issues. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
