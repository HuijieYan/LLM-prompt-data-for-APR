The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be arising from the way it handles large values and their absolute comparison. When the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` becomes very large, it leads to an overflow error when taking the absolute value of that variable. This causes a runtime warning and ultimately leads to a failing test.

To fix this bug, it's important to handle large values differently and avoid comparing values based on their absolute sizes.

One possible approach to fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function is to modify the way the comparison and absolute values are handled when the values are very large. Additionally, we can adjust the condition for checking closeness to zero.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        return vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function will handle large values and comparisons more effectively, avoiding overflow errors and failures.
