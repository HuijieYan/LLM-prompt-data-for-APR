1. The nonsingular function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, but it is encountering overflow errors due to calculations resulting in extreme values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation involving maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)).

3. The error is caused because the calculation of maxabsvalue could result in overflow, leading to a RuntimeWarning.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the overflow condition by adding a check for overflow before performing the maxabsvalue calculation. This can be done by checking if the absolute values of vmin and vmax are close to the maximum representable value for the data type being used.

5. Here's the corrected code for the nonsingular function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxval = 1e15
    if abs(vmin) > maxval or abs(vmax) > maxval:
        # handle overflow condition by setting vmin and vmax to safe values
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
        if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
                vmin = -expander
                vmax = expander
            else:
                vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected code includes a check for overflow and handles it by setting vmin and vmax to safe values when the absolute values are close to the maximum representable value for the data type. This approach should resolve the overflow issues and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
