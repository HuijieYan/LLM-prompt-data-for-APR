The `nonsingular` function is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It is called within the `_process_values` method of the Colorbar class, which is in turn called when creating a colorbar in the matplotlib library. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is trying to create a colorbar and it fails with a RuntimeWarning related to overflow and scalar subtract.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is likely the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This calculation is causing the overflow error when `vmin` and `vmax` are large numbers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to change the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to handle large numbers without causing overflow. This can be done by using conditional checks to compare the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The corrected code for the `nonsingular` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    if abs_vmin < abs_vmax:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmax
    else:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmin

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With the corrected code, the failing test `test_colorbar_int` should now pass without causing any overflow or RuntimeWarning.
