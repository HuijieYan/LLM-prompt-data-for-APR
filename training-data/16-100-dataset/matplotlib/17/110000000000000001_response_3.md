1. The buggy function "nonsingular" is supposed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are several potential errors in the function, including potential issues with the logic for expanding the range and swapping the endpoints.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function include:
   - The logic for expanding the range based on the interval size.
   - The logic for swapping the endpoints if vmin is greater than vmax.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect conditional statements and swapping logic that may not handle all edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results for certain input values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing and revising the logic for expanding the range to ensure it properly handles edge cases and small intervals.
   - Reviewing and revising the logic for swapping the endpoints to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios, taking into account the 'increasing' parameter.

5. Corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif vmin < vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin, vmax = -expander, expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin, vmax = -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```
In this corrected code, the logic for swapping the endpoints is updated to properly handle the 'increasing' parameter, and the logic for expanding the range is revised to handle edge cases and small intervals more accurately.
