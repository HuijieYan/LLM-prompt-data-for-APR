The problematic function “nonsingular” is supposed to modify the endpoints of a range in order to avoid singularities. It takes in vmin and vmax as the initial endpoints, and the function is supposed to expand these endpoints if necessary based on the values of expander and tiny. It also checks for the finiteness of the input endpoints and ensures that they are swapped if the increasing parameter is set to False. 

The failing test “test_colorbar_int” is testing the colorbar functionality, and it creates a colorbar for the image plot with the given endpoints using the buggy function. The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered" when attempting to calculate the maximum absolute value of vmin and vmax in the nonsingular function.

The potential error location within the nonsingular function is likely to be in the calculation of the maximum absolute value of vmin and vmax when determining if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded.

The cause of the bug is due to a calculation error when computing the maximum absolute value of vmin and vmax inside the “nonsingular” function, which leads to an overflow error.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to review the calculation for the maximum absolute value and evaluate if the formula used for this is correctly handling the numeric range provided.

Here's the corrected code for the “nonsingular” function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code adjusts the calculation to determine the maximum absolute value and ensures the correct handling of the input numeric range. This should resolve the overflow error and allow the function to pass the failing test without issues.
