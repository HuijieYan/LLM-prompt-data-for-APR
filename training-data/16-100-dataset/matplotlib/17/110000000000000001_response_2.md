1. The buggy function `nonsingular` takes in two endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, and modifies them to avoid singularities. It performs checks and adjustments based on the given parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`.

2. The potential error is likely in the section where the function checks whether the interval is too small and needs to be expanded.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are very close to zero properly. It should expand the interval in this case as well, but the current implementation does not account for it.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the condition for checking if the interval is too small to also account for the case when both vmin and vmax are very close to zero. Additionally, the function could be streamlined to make the logic clearer and more consistent.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny or (vmax == 0 and vmin == 0):
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
