Potential Error Location: The potential error in the given function is in the calculation of the expanded endpoints based on the size of the interval and the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.

Bug's Cause: The bug occurs because the calculation for expanding the interval based on the size of the interval and the maximum absolute value of the endpoints is not accurate.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for expanding the interval to ensure that it accurately reflects the size of the interval and the maximum absolute value of the endpoints.
2. Check the conditions for swapping the endpoints when the 'increasing' parameter is set to False.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
