The `nonsingular` function is used in the test `test_colorbar_int` which is a part of the `test_colorbar.py` file. The error message is specifically related to the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line in the `nonsingular` function. The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute".

The issue is that there is an overflow error occurring in the `abs` function when it is trying to calculate the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. This is happening when the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is too large or there is a close to zero value involved.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to modify the `nonsingular` function so that it correctly handles the absolute value calculation in cases where overflow can occur.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if np.isclose(vmax, 0) and np.isclose(vmin, 0):
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected version of the `nonsingular` function, it should now handle the overflow error when calculating the absolute value, and not produce any runtime warnings. This should make the failing test pass successfully.
