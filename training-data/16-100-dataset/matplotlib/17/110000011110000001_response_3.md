1. The problematic function `nonsingular` is responsible for modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It seems like the issue arises from the calculation and comparison of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent conditional statements.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional logic that is used to decide how to modify the input endpoints.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect calculation or comparison of the `maxabsvalue`, leading to `RuntimeWarning` related to overflow and scalar absolute encountered.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the calculation of `maxabsvalue` to ensure it accurately represents the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.
   - Checking the conditional statements to ensure they are correctly handling the cases of small intervals and zero values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version revises the conditional statements to properly handle the scenarios described in the test cases. This should resolve the overflows and scalar absolute warnings and ensure that the function works as intended.
