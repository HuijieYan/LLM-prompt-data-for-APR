The bug in the provided function seems to be occurring when the input values for `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped due to the `increasing` flag, and the `swapped` variable is not being considered in the subsequent calculations. 

The cause of the bug is that when the values are swapped, the logic for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` does not take into account the fact that the values were swapped. This leads to incorrect adjustments and returns the wrong values.

To fix the bug, we need to account for the `swapped` variable in the calculations for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    elif not increasing and vmin < vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin) * (-1 if swapped else 1)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax) * (-1 if swapped else 1)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code takes into account the `swapped` variable and adjusts the `vmin` and `vmax` values accordingly. This ensures that the function now satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
