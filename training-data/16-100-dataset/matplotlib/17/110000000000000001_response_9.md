1. The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in parameters including vmin, vmax, and expander, and then applies some logic to expand or swap the endpoints as necessary.

2. One potential error location within the function is the handling of the condition vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny. The logic within this condition may not be handling the expansion of the interval correctly, leading to potential errors.

3. The bug's cause in the function is that it may not be properly expanding the interval when it is too small. This can lead to incorrect endpoint values, which can impact the function's intended behavior.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to perform thorough testing with different input values to identify specific scenarios where the function fails to correctly expand the interval. Additionally, revisiting the logic within the condition vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny and ensuring that the expansion is applied correctly in all cases could help resolve the issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            expansion = expander * maxabsvalue
            vmin -= expansion
            vmax += expansion

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the logic within the condition vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny has been modified to correctly calculate the expansion and adjust the endpoints. This should help address the potential error and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
