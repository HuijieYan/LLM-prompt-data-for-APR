1. The function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in the initial endpoints `vmin` and `vmax`, and has parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing` with default values. The function checks for finiteness of `vmin` and `vmax`, swaps the endpoints if `vmax < vmin`, and then expands the range if it is too small based on the `expander` and `tiny` values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition checking for a small interval and in the calculation to expand the range.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition for a small interval is not properly capturing the case when both `vmax` and `vmin` are close to zero.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the condition for a small interval to properly capture the case when both `vmax` and `vmin` are close to zero.
   - Modify the calculation to expand the range to correctly handle the scenario when both `vmax` and `vmin` are close to zero.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```
