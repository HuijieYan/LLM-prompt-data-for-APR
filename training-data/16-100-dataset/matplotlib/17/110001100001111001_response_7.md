The bug in the function seems to be related to the condition that checks if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small. It then expands the interval by a fraction. However, this condition does not seem to be working correctly as the actual output does not match the expected output for several test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition that checks the interval size and adjust the logic for expanding the interval.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:  # swap if increasing is True and vmin is still greater than vmax
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
