The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be caused by improper handling of extreme input values, resulting in overflow errors and incorrect results.

Upon analyzing the failing test and error messages, we can see that the function is encountering overflow issues when working with large input values and not handling negative values properly, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle extreme input values and negative numbers to prevent overflow issues and incorrect results.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
            
    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function handles extreme input values and negative numbers properly, addressing the overflow issues encountered previously, and should now pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
