The issue in the `nonsingular` function is that it is not handling the case where the input values are very large, leading to an overflow error.

Looking at the failing test code and the error message, it's clear that when the input values are very large, an overflow error is encountered in the calculations related to the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The function should be modified to handle the case where input values are very large and could potentially cause an overflow error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are going to cause an overflow before performing any calculations involving those values. We can adjust the logic in the function to handle this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue > 1e200:  # Check for large absolute values
        vmin /= maxabsvalue
        vmax /= maxabsvalue

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, the function will handle large absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid overflow errors and pass the failing test cases.
