Analysis:
The buggy function `nonsingular` is a part of the `matplotlib` library and is responsible for modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function checks for finite values and swaps the endpoints if necessary, and also applies expansions to the range if it is too small.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function lies in the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. This condition is used to determine if the range is very small and needs to be expanded.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not effective at accurately identifying when the range is too small. This can lead to improper expansion or swapping of the endpoints.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the condition for determining when the range is too small to make it more accurate.
2. Check for potential numerical precision issues when comparing small values.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` has been replaced with `maxabsvalue < tiny`. This adjustment ensures that the function accurately identifies when the range is too small and applies the necessary expansions. Additionally, the function has been simplified to improve readability.
