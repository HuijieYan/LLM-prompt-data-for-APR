1. The buggy function `nonsingular` is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes into account the values of `vmin` and `vmax`, expands them if necessary, and swaps them if `increasing` is set to `False`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks for the size of the interval. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` seems to be incorrect and not handling all cases properly.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The conditional statement `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not handling all cases properly, resulting in improper expansion of the endpoints in some scenarios.
   (b). The calculation of `maxabsvalue` and comparison of the interval size with `maxabsvalue * tiny` may not be accurate in all cases, leading to incorrect expansion decisions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing and revising the conditional statements to ensure they cover all necessary cases for expanding the endpoints.
   - Checking the logic for calculating `maxabsvalue` and deciding on the expansion of the interval based on its size relative to `tiny` in a more accurate manner.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmax - vmin <= (tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))):
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement for checking the interval size has been updated to `(tiny * max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)))`. This ensures that the expansion decision is based on the maximum absolute value of the endpoints and the `tiny` value. The logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` has also been updated to correctly handle the `increasing` parameter. Additionally, the `swapped` variable has been removed, as it is no longer necessary.
