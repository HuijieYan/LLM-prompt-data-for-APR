The problem in the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent comparison with `tiny`. Additionally, there are instances of potential overflow issues as indicated by the error messages.

The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered in the function, specifically when taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. This aligns with the observation that `maxabsvalue` is calculated using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. 

The function seems to be encountering overflow issues when performing absolute value calculations on large input values.

To fix this issue, the overflow problem needs to be addressed by using appropriate data types for the variables involved in absolute value calculations. It might be beneficial to convert all input parameters to a consistent data type (e.g., `float`) to avoid overflow issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)  # Convert input to float type

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version ensures that input parameters are converted to `float` type, which mitigates potential overflow issues and aligns with the expected input/output variable information.
