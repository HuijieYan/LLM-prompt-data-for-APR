The buggy function "nonsingular" in the matplotlib transforms module is used to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes parameters `vmin` and `vmax` and modifies them based on the specified criteria.

The potential error in this function seems to be in the calculation of the expanded endpoints. The condition `if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` seems to be incorrect and causing the function to not handle the expansion of endpoints properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditions for expanding the endpoints and handle the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` more effectively.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` (`if increasing and vmax < vmin`) is modified to handle the `increasing` parameter properly.
- The condition for expanding the endpoints is updated to compare with `tiny` directly, and the calculation for expanded endpoints is adjusted.

These changes will ensure that the function properly handles the expansion and swapping of endpoints to avoid singularities.
