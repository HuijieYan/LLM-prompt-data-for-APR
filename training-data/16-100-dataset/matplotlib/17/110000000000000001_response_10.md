1. The nonsingular function takes in two endpoints (vmin and vmax) and modifies them to avoid singularities based on certain conditions. It also takes in parameters expander, tiny, and increasing with default values.

2. The potential error location is the if statement checking if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny. This condition seems to be incorrect as it is not handling the singularities properly.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case when the interval is too small and needs to be expanded. It is also not correctly handling the case when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check and modify the condition for the interval being too small to properly handle the case.
   - Add a separate condition to handle the case when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue <= tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
