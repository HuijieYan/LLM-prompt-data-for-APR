Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the section where the function checks if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold and needs to be expanded. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` seems to be causing some unexpected results.

Bug Cause:
The implementation of the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is not handling all edge cases correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and the failing of some test cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adding additional checks for specific edge cases such as when `vmin` is negative and `vmax` is positive, or when both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero.
2. Refactoring the conditional logic to ensure that all possible scenarios are accounted for.
3. Ensuring that the comparisons and calculations are carried out using consistent data types.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny and vmin != 0 and vmax != 0:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
