1. The buggy function `nonsingular` takes in two endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` and modifies them to avoid singularities. It also has parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing` with default values. The function checks for non-finite input and swaps the endpoints if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. It then calculates the maximum absolute value of the endpoints and modifies them based on certain conditions.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent conditions that modify `vmin` and `vmax`.

3. The bug in the function could be caused by incorrect handling of singularities and potentially incorrect modification of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the conditions. The function needs to ensure that the modifications are appropriate for avoiding singularities and that the logic for the conditions is correct.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include reviewing the conditions for modifying `vmin` and `vmax` to ensure they are accurately checking for singularities and appropriately adjusting the endpoints. Additionally, ensuring that the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` is handled correctly based on the `increasing` parameter.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax == 0) or (abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- I added a condition to check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are zero or very close to zero and return the appropriate values.
- I simplified the swapping of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter to ensure correctness.
- I removed the unnecessary calculations for the `maxabsvalue` and modified the conditions to properly adjust `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid singularities.
