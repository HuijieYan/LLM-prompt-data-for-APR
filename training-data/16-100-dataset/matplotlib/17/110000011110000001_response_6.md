1. The buggy function `nonsingular` takes two input endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` and modifies them as needed to avoid singularities by expanding them if the original interval is too small. The failing test is related to the `nonsingular` function because it's trying to create a colorbar and is encountering an overflow issue when calling this function. The error messages indicate that there are runtime warnings due to overflow encountered in scalar subtract and overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

2. The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is where the calculations for expanding the interval take place, specifically within the `if` statements that compare the interval size with the threshold `tiny`. 

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect comparison and handling of the interval size in relation to the `tiny` threshold. When the interval size is very small relative to the threshold, it leads to overflow warnings during calculations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adjusting the comparison and expansion logic to avoid reaching an interval size that causes overflow warnings.
   b. Revising the conditions in the `if` statements to prevent the interval size from becoming too small relative to the threshold.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or vmax == vmin:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version handles the condition where `vmax` is equal to `vmin` as well as ensures that the interval size comparisons and expansions are calculated correctly to avoid overflow warnings. It should now pass the failing test without encountering the previous errors.
