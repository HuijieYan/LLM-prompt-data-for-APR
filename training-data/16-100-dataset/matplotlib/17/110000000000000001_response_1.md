1. The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there are potential issues with the swapping logic and the conditions for expanding the interval.
   
2. The potential error location within the function is the logic for expanding the interval and swapping the endpoints.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditions for expanding the interval and swapping the endpoints are not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect behavior of the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditions for expanding the interval and swapping the endpoints to ensure the correct behavior of the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin >= vmax) or (np.isclose(vmin, vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditions for checking if the inputs are finite, if they are equal, and if they are in the correct order have been updated.
- The logic for expanding the interval has been adjusted to handle zeros and avoid inconsistent behavior.
- The swapping of endpoints has been updated to correctly handle the `increasing` parameter.
