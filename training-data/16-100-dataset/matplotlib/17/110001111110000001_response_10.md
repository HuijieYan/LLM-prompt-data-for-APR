The potential error in the problematic function `nonsingular` is the calculation of `maxabsvalue` inside the elif condition. 

The failing test is encountering a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`. These warnings are indicating that there is an overflow happening in the calculations of the `maxabsvalue` and the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.

To fix the bug, we can update the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the condition for checking the interval size.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    interval_size = vmax - vmin

    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif interval_size <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In this corrected code, we've added a condition to check if the `maxabsvalue` is less than `tiny`, and updated the condition for checking the interval size based on the difference between `vmax` and `vmin`. These changes should fix the potential overflow encountered in the original function.
