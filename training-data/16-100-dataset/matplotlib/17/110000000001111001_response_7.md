The potential error in the given function lies in the condition where the interval is very small. The logic to expand the interval if it is very small seems to be incorrect.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly modifying the endpoints to avoid singularities.

To fix the bug, we should update the condition for expanding the interval. Instead of checking whether the difference between vmax and vmin is less than the max absolute value times tiny, we need to check if vmax and vmin are the same (or very close). If they are, we should modify both endpoints to avoid the singularity. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        if vmax == 0:
            vmax += expander
            vmin -= expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
