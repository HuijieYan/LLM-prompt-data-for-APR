The problematic function is `nonsingular` from the file `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py`. The function is responsible for modifying the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities.

The error message indicates that an overflow is encountered in the `nonsingular` function. The failing test function also demonstrates that the error is related to `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`.

The issue is likely caused by the computation of `maxabsvalue` when the absolute value of `vmax` is very large, leading to an overflow error.

To fix the bug, the computation of `maxabsvalue` needs to be adjusted in the `nonsingular` function to avoid potential overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)) or (vmin == vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected implementation handles the potential for overflow by checking for cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are non-finite or equal. It also ensures that the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` are properly considered when computing `maxabsvalue`. This implementation should pass the failing test and resolve the overflow issue.
