Potential error location: The potential error location is with the calculation of `maxabsvalue` using the `max` and `abs` functions. 

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` messages. These warnings indicate that the calculation is causing an overflow due to the large values involved.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a safer method to calculate `maxabsvalue` without risking overflow.
2. Check for the boundaries and limit the values to avoid overflow.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Checking for overflow situations using boundary conditions
    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```
