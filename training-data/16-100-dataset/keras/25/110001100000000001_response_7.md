The potential error in the buggy function is that when mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the mean and std variables are assigned based on whether the data format is 'channels_first' or not, but then there is no normalization or scaling applied to the input array x before it is returned.

To fix this bug, we need to add the normalization and scaling steps for the 'caffe' mode, and also add the normalization step for the 'torch' mode before returning the preprocessed array.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean

    return x
```
In the corrected code:
- For 'tf' mode, the input array x is scaled and then the mean pixel is subtracted.
- For 'torch' mode, the input array x is scaled and normalized using the mean and std of the ImageNet dataset.
- For the default case (caffe mode), the input array x is transformed from RGB to BGR, and then the mean pixel is subtracted.
