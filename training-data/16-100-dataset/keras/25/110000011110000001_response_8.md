1. The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` calls this function with both float and int image inputs. The error message indicates that the function is trying to subtract a float value from an array of type int32, leading to the error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the code section where it tries to subtract the mean values from the input array based on the data format.

3. The bug is caused by the function attempting to subtract a floating-point value from an array of type int32 when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', and the data format is not 'channels_first'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Ensuring that the input array is converted to a floating-point type before any arithmetic operations are performed on it.
   b. Checking the data format and mode conditions to ensure that the correct type conversions and calculations are used based on the input settings.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
