The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it is not correctly handling the 'caffe' mode. The function seems to be applying the 'caffe' mode operations for all cases, regardless of the actual mode passed as a parameter.

To fix the issue, the 'caffe' mode should only be applied to the input array when the mode is set to 'caffe'. Additionally, the mean and standard deviation values are hardcoded and should be according to the selected mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Zero-center by mean pixel and adjust for the selected mode
        if mode == 'caffe':
            if std is not None:
                x /= 255.0  # Scale to [0, 1]
                for i in range(3):
                    x[..., i] -= mean[i]
                    x[..., i] /= std[i]
            else:
                for i in range(3):
                    x[..., i] -= mean[i]
        elif mode == 'tf':
            # Scale to [-1, 1]
            x /= 127.5
            x -= 1.

    return x
```

This corrected function ensures that the mode parameter is correctly handled, and the operations are applied based on the selected mode. It should now satisfy all the provided input/output variable information.
