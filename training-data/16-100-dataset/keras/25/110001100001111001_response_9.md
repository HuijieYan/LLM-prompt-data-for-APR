The issue with the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the conversion from RGB to BGR for the 'caffe' mode when the data format is 'channels_last'. Additionally, it doesn't correctly normalize the input for the 'torch' mode when the data format is 'channels_last'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the 'caffe' mode and 'torch' mode for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
            x -= mean[:, None, None]
            x /= std[:, None, None]
        else:
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
            x -= mean
            x /= std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]

    x -= mean
    return x
```

With this corrected version of the function, it will correctly handle the preprocessing for the 'caffe', 'tf', and 'torch' modes, taking into account both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.
