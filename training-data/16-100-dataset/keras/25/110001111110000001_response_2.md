The error is caused by the fact that in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the code performs operations on the input variable `x` without taking into account the data type of the input. This causes issues when the input is an array of integers, as it tries to perform operations that are not valid for integer arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that operations are only performed on floating point arrays, and convert the input to the same data type as the input. We can use the `astype` method to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if x.dtype == 'float64':
        x = x.astype('float32')
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    if x.dtype == 'float64':
        x = x.astype('float32')

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the input array `x` is of type `'float64'`, and if so, we convert it to `'float32'`. We then perform the operations based on the data type of the input array, ensuring that the appropriate operations are performed. This should resolve the issues with operating on integers and prevent the errors seen in the failing test.
