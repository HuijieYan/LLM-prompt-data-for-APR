Potential error location: When the `mode` is set to `caffe` and the `data_format` is not set to `channels_first`, the function does not seem to be converting the images from RGB to BGR as expected.

Bug's Cause: When the `mode` is set to `caffe` and the `data_format` is not set to `channels_first`, the function does not properly handle the RGB to BGR conversion.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the RGB to BGR conversion when the `mode` is set to `caffe` and the `data_format` is not set to `channels_first`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```
