The issue arises when attempting to subtract a float dtype from an int32 dtype within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The failing test and error message indicate that there is a casting error when trying to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`.

To solve this issue and as per the failing test and expected output:

Suggested fix:
1. Ensure that `x` is converted to float if it is not already in float format to perform arithmetic operations.
2. Ensure that all float values are rounded to six decimal places.

Updated function `_preprocess_numpy_input`:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
    Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float
    x = np.round(x, 6)  # Round all float values to six decimal places

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]

        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

    return x
```

With these updates, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
