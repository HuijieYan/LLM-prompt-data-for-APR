The bug in the function is due to the way pixel values are being manipulated according to the 'mode' parameter. The code is not correctly handling the different data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last').

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements for the different modes and data formats to properly preprocess the input array.

Here is the corrected code for the _preprocess_numpy_input function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = np.transpose(x, (0, 3, 1, 2))  # Change data format to 'channels_first'
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]

        x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]

    return x
```

With this corrected function, it properly handles different data formats and modes, and it should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
