The current function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is attempting to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the values of `data_format` and `mode`. The failing test is failing due to a `UFuncTypeError` during the subtraction of the mean values from the input array `x`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the calculation of `mean` and `std` values and their subsequent subtraction from the input array `x`.

The bug is caused by the attempt to subtract float values from an array of type 'int32', leading to a `UFuncTypeError`.

To fix the bug, you can explicitly convert the input array `x` to float before performing any arithmetic operations. This will ensure that the input array is of the appropriate type to handle the arithmetic operations without encountering a `UFuncTypeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By explicitly converting the input array `x` to float using the `astype('float32')` method, we ensure that all arithmetic operations within the function are performed using float values. This resolves the `UFuncTypeError` encountered in the failing test.
