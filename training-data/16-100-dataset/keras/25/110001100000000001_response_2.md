The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of mean and std values for the 'torch' mode. There is no return statement for this mode, and the mean and std values are calculated but not used further.

The bug is caused by the function not returning the preprocessed array for the 'torch' mode, and the mean and std values not being used after being calculated.

To fix the bug, we should include a return statement for the 'torch' mode and use the mean and std values for preprocessing the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= np.array(mean)[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]
        else:
            x -= np.array(mean)
        x /= 255.0
        return x
```
