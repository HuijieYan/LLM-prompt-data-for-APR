To fix the issue in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to ensure that the `x` array has the same data type before and after performing the preprocessing operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Ensure x is of float32 type
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

In this corrected version, the first operation performed is to ensure that the input image array `x` is of type `np.float32`. This allows for further calculations to be executed without triggering a `UFuncTypeError`. The calculations for both `caffe` and `torch` modes are performed using float32 types, ensuring datatype consistency throughout.
