The cause of the bug is that in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, when `data_format` is `'channels_last'`, the code is assuming that the input `x` is of type `float32`, but when `x` is of type `int32`, it causes a ufunc type error when trying to perform subtraction operations. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to type `float32` before performing any arithmetic operations. 

Additionally, the calculation of the `mean` value should account for the type of input `x` as well. 

Here is the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x

```

With these changes, the function will handle both `int32` and `float32` inputs correctly and perform the preprocessing according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`. This should resolve the ufunc type error and make the function pass the failing test.
