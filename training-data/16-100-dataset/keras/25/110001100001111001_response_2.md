The bug in the function is that the conditional checks for `mode == 'tf'` and `mode == 'torch'` do not have a return statement, causing the function to continue executing even after these conditions are met. This results in incorrect preprocessing for the specified mode.

To fix the bug, we need to add return statements after the conditional checks for `mode == 'tf'` and `mode == 'torch'. This will ensure that the function returns the preprocessed `x` for these modes without proceeding to the subsequent preprocessing steps.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
