1. The buggy function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images. It takes input array `x`, data format, and mode as arguments and preprocesses the array based on the mode specified.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when the mode is 'torch', as it does not correctly normalize the input array `x`.

3. The bug's cause is that when mode is 'torch', the mean and std values are calculated but not applied to the input array `x`.

4. Approach for fixing the bug:
   - Apply the mean and std values to the input array `x` when mode is 'torch'.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
