The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly preprocess the input array based on the mode specified. This results in incorrect output values for the input array 'x'. The function is not handling the 'caffe' mode correctly and it is not reversing the channels when the data format is 'channels_last'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly preprocess the input array based on the mode specified and handle the data format accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

With the corrected code, the function now correctly preprocesses the input array based on the mode and data format specified, producing the expected output values for the input array 'x' in each case provided.
