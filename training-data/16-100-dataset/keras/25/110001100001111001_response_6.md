The issue with the provided function is that it does not handle the 'caffe' mode correctly for the 'channels_last' data format. The function does not correctly convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

To fix this, we need to modify the code under the condition `if mode == 'caffe'` for the 'channels_last' data format. We will also need to adjust the calculations for mean pixel subtraction and scaling for each color channel.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
