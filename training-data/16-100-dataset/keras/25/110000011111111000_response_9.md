To fix the _preprocess_numpy_input function, we need to ensure that all calculations are performed with the same data type as the input x. This includes converting the mean and std values to the same data type as x before performing the calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the _preprocess_numpy_input function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 for consistent computation

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32) * 255
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32) * 255
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

I've made the following changes:
1. Converted the input array x to `float32` at the beginning of the function to ensure consistent computation.
2. Updated the calculations for the `mean` and `std` arrays according to the `mode` and converted them to the same data type as x.
3. Removed the separate conditions for `data_format == 'channels_first'` and combined the calculations using numpy broadcasting.

These changes should address the type mismatch issue in the failing test and provide the expected results for the preprocess_input function.
