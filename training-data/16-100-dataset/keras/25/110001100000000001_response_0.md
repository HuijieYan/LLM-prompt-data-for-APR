The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect application of preprocessing steps based on the mode selected. The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the preprocessing steps for the different modes.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly apply the preprocessing steps based on the selected mode. Specifically, the function should correctly handle the preprocessing steps for each mode: "tf", "torch", and the default case.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:  # Default: mode == 'caffe'
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected code, the preprocessing steps are correctly implemented based on the selected mode. This approach ensures that the function applies the appropriate preprocessing steps for each mode, which addresses the bug in the original code.
