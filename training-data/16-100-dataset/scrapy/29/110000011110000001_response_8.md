The potential error location in the `request_httprepr` function is the `parsed.hostname` attribute. Based on the error message, it seems that the `parsed` variable is being returned as `None`, causing the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` call to fail.

This could be due to the `urlparse_cached` function not handling non-HTTP URLs properly, returning `None` for the `parsed` object.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-HTTP URLs gracefully and ensure that the `parsed` object is not None before attempting to access its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
import six

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    
    if not parsed.scheme:
        parsed = urlparse('http:' + request.url)

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we handle non-HTTP URLs by checking if the parsed object doesn't have a scheme and then parsing the URL with the 'http' scheme. This ensures that the parsed object is not None and the subsequent attribute access won't cause an error. This should make the `request_httprepr` function pass the failing test.
