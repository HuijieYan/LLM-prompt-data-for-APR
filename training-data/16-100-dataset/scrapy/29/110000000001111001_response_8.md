Potential error location:
The issue appears to be with the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where the `parsed.hostname` is not being used correctly to populate the 'Host' field.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by using `parsed.hostname` directly to populate the 'Host' field, which is incorrect. Instead, the correct value for the 'Host' field should be derived from the netloc attribute of the parsed URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Extract the 'Host' value from the `parsed.netloc` attribute and use it to populate the 'Host' field.
2. Ensure that the 'Host' value is included in the correct format within the raw HTTP representation.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.netloc if parsed.netloc else parsed.hostname  # Extract host from netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"  # Use extracted host
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
