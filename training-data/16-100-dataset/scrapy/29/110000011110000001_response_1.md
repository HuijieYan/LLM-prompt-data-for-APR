1. The buggy function, request_httprepr, is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request as bytes. The failing test is trying to test the function by passing in a non-HTTP request and expecting it not to fail. The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a NoneType object to bytes, which is causing a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it tries to convert the parsed hostname to bytes.

3. The bug is caused by the function not handling non-HTTP requests properly. When the function receives a non-HTTP request, it fails to handle the parsed hostname as it is None, resulting in a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the request is an HTTP request before trying to access the parsed hostname.
   - Providing a default value for the parsed hostname if it is None in the case of non-HTTP requests.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the function will now check if the request is an HTTP request and only attempt to access the parsed hostname if it is. This change should allow the function to handle non-HTTP requests without throwing a TypeError.
