1. The buggy function takes a request object and is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely around the concatenation of different byte strings. It looks like the function is trying to build the HTTP request by concatenating various components using the `+` operator, which may cause issues with byte string encoding.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of byte strings and concatenation.

4. To fix the bug, we can use the `bytes` for concatenation, and properly encode the strings using `.encode('utf-8')` method.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:5] + ('',))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header in request.headers:
            s += header.encode('utf-8') + b": " + request.headers[header].encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we use the `.encode('utf-8')` method to properly encode the strings before concatenation. We also use the `+` operator with `bytes` type for concatenating byte strings. Additionally, the correction includes a change of the `urlparse_cached` function to the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module, as the former function was not available in the provided code.
