# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('','',parsed.path or '/','',parsed.params,parsed.query,''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version uses the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module for parsing and constructing URLs, and encodes the string values using UTF-8 to ensure they are in bytes format.

Note: It's important to put the `from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse` at the top of the file, assuming it's not already imported. Additionally, `scrapy.http.request.Request` is imported to use the `Request` class for the test function provided.
