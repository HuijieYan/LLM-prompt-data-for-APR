Potential Error Location:
The bug in the function `request_httprepr` is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `urlunparse` function, which results in the incorrect generation of the HTTP request string.

Bug's Cause:
The `urlunparse` function is being used with an incorrect argument structure, which leads to an incorrect `path` and `Host` value in the constructed HTTP request string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to construct the `path` and `Host` values correctly by utilizing the correct arguments for the `urlunparse` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

The corrected code includes the usage of the correct arguments for the `urlunparse` function and fixes the construction of the HTTP request string. The function now takes the `url` attribute from the request to parse and construct the correct `path` and `Host` values for the HTTP request. This will ensure that the function generates the correct raw HTTP representation of the request.
