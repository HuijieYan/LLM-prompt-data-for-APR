The `request_httprepr` function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request, but it is failing when a non-HTTP request is provided. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object.

The issue is likely with the `parsed.hostname` value, which is resulting in a `NoneType` being passed to `to_bytes`. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can use a default value in case `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can also add a check to ensure that the `parsed` object has a `hostname` attribute before using it.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if hasattr(parsed, 'hostname') and parsed.hostname:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    else:
        host = b""
    
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, `parsed.hostname` is checked for existence before attempting to use it, and a default value of an empty byte string is used if it is `None`. This should fix the issue and make the function work as expected.
