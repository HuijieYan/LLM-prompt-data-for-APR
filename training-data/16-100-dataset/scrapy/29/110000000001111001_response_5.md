The bug in the function is due to the inconsistency in the `parsed.hostname` field. In the first case, `parsed.hostname` is an empty string, resulting in an empty `Host` header in the HTTP representation. In the second case, `parsed.hostname` is correctly set to `'localhost'`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL instead of `hostname` to set the `Host` header.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
