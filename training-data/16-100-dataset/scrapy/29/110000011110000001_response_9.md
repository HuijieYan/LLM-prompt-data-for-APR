1. The buggy function is `request_httprepr`, which takes a request and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. The failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` is testing the function with a non-HTTP request.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is on line:
   `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`
   The error message states that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `parsed` object returned from `urlparse_cached` may not have a `hostname` attribute, resulting in `None`. When `to_bytes` is called on `parsed.hostname`, it throws a `TypeError` due to the `NoneType` object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before calling `to_bytes` on it.
   b. Providing a default value for the `hostname` if it's `None`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from six import string_types

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
The corrected code checks if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before appending it to the result. Additionally, it ensures that the `parsed.path` has a default value if it's `None`. This code should now pass the failing test.
