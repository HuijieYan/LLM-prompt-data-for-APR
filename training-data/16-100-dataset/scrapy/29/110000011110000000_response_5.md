# The fixed and corrected version of the function
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.web.client import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the fixed version of the function, the import statement for `urllib.parse` and `twisted.web.client` is added. The `urlparse_cached` method is replaced with `urlparse` and the correct structure of the URL is being parsed and constructed in the `path` variable. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is called with the proper parameters to ensure a TypeError is not raised.
