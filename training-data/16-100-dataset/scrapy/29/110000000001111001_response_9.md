The bug in the function seems to be related to the construction of the HTTP request string. It seems that the "Host" header is not being set correctly, and also the path might not be encoded properly. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual output values for variables 's' and 'parsed'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "Host" header is set correctly using the parsed hostname. Additionally, we need to make sure that the path is properly encoded using `quote` method from urllib.parse.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse, quote

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = quote(parsed.path or '/')
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, the function should now provide the correct raw HTTP representation for the given request, as evidenced by the expected input/output variable information provided.
