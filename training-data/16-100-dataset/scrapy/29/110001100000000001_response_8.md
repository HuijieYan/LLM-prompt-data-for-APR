1. The buggy function request_httprepr is responsible for returning the raw HTTP representation of the given request. It uses other functions like urlparse_cached and urlunparse for parsing the URL, and to_bytes for converting string to bytes. It also uses request.method, request.headers, and request.body to build the raw HTTP representation.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the handling of request.headers, as well as in the concatenation of the string values.

3. (a) The buggy function tries to build the raw HTTP representation by concatenating different parts of the request. This includes the method, path, hostname, headers, and body.
   (b) The related functions like urlparse_cached and urlunparse are used to parse the URL, and to_bytes is used to convert strings to bytes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if request.headers is not None before trying to concatenate it with other bytes.
   - Handling the conversion of different parts of the request to bytes more carefully to avoid any encoding issues.
   - Ensuring that the concatenation of different parts of the request is done properly without introducing any errors.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```
