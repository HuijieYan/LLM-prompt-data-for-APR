The bug in the function is caused by the fact that the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` in the case when the scheme is not "http" or "https". The function `urlparse_cached` is being called, but it's not clear from the information provided whether it's a customized function or part of a library.

To fix this issue, a check for `parsed.hostname` being `None` needs to be added, and if it is `None`, then the hostname should default to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `parsed.hostname` is checked for being `None` before using it, and if it is `None`, it's not added to the raw HTTP representation.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected outputs for the given input parameters.
