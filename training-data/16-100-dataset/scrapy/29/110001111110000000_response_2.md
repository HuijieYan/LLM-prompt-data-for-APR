# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = bytes(request.method, 'utf-8') + b" " + bytes(path, 'utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + bytes(parsed.hostname, 'utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += bytes(request.headers.to_string(), 'utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The changes made in the corrected function include:
1. Imported the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from `urllib.parse` module.
2. Replaced `urlparse_cached` with `urlparse` and updated the usage accordingly.
3. Used the `urlparse` function to parse the URL from the request.
4. Used the `urlunparse` function to construct the path from the parsed URL components.
5. Converted the method, path, hostname, and headers to bytes using the `bytes` function with the 'utf-8' encoding.
6. Removed the check for method type and directly converted it to bytes.

With these changes, the function should now handle different types of requests gracefully, without raising the TypeError mentioned in the failing test.
