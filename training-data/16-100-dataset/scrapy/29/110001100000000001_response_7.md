Analysis:
The function `request_httprepr` is responsible for returning the raw HTTP representation of the given request. It uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request, and then constructs the HTTP representation using the parsed data. The bug could potentially be in the parsing of the request data or in the construction of the HTTP representation.

Bug Cause:
The potential cause of the bug could be related to how the `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the request, particularly in handling the path and constructing the URL. It could also be related to how the HTTP representation is constructed using the parsed data.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Check the `urlparse_cached` function for any issues in parsing the request data.
2. Verify the construction of the HTTP representation to ensure that it includes all the necessary components (method, path, hostname, headers, and body).

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_unicode() + b"\r\n"  # Change to_unicode() method to convert headers to bytes
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)  # Convert request body to bytes
    return s
```
In the corrected code, we make use of the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module and ensure that the necessary components of the HTTP representation (method, path, hostname, headers, and body) are properly converted to bytes using the `to_bytes` function. We also made adjustments to the handling of headers and the body to ensure they are properly converted to bytes.
