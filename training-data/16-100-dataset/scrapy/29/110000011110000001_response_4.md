The error occurs when the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which causes the `to_bytes()` function to fail since it expects a string as an input.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before concatenating it to the `s` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding it to the `s` string, avoiding the `NoneType` error. This should make the function compatible with the failing test and should no longer raise an error.
