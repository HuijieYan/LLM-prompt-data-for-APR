1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` is responsible for returning the raw HTTP representation of the given request. It uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request and `urlunparse` function to construct the path. It then creates an HTTP request string and appends the request headers and body to it.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the concatenation and manipulation of the various components of the HTTP request in the `s` variable.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to the incorrect handling of the request body and headers, leading to an incorrect HTTP representation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Ensure that the request headers and body are correctly appended to the HTTP request string.
   (b) Verify the correct usage of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions.
   (c) Check for any encoding or decoding issues while constructing the HTTP request.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body.encode('utf-8') if request.body else b''
    return s
```
