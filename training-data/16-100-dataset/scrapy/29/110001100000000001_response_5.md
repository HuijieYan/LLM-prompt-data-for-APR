1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` takes a request object and tries to construct the raw HTTP representation of the request. It uses functions like `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, `to_bytes`, and `request.headers.to_string()` to build the HTTP request. The potential error location seems to be with the construction of the `path` variable and the concatenation of all the request information into `s`.

2. The potential error within the problematic function is likely the incorrect construction of the `path` variable and the concatenation of request information into `s`.

3. The bug might be caused by improper handling of the parsed URL components and the request data. The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions might not be providing the correct `path` value, leading to incorrect HTTP representation. Additionally, the concatenation of request method, path, headers, and body might not be done in the correct way.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Verifying the values returned by `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` to ensure that the `path` is being constructed correctly.
   - Verifying the format and encoding of the request method, headers, and body when constructing the raw HTTP representation.
   - Ensuring that the concatenation of all request information is done in a proper sequential order.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += to_bytes(header) + b': ' + to_bytes(value) + b'\r\n'
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```
In the corrected code:
- The `urlparse_cached` function is replaced with `urlparse` for parsing the URL components.
- The construction of the `path` variable using `urlunparse` is adjusted to ensure the correct format.
- The headers are iterated through to properly concatenate the header and value pairs.
- The encoding to bytes and concatenation of request method, path, headers, and body are adjusted to ensure proper HTTP representation.
