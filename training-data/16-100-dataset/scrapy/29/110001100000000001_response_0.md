1. The buggy function is `request_httprepr` in the file `scrapy/utils/request.py`. It is responsible for returning the raw HTTP representation of the given request.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the concatenation of the HTTP request elements, such as method, path, hostname, headers, and body. 

3. The bug's cause could be due to improper concatenation of the request elements or incorrect formatting of the HTTP representation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Check the concatenation of the request elements to ensure they are properly formatted.
   b. Verify the conversion of elements to bytes to ensure it is done correctly.
   c. Ensure that all necessary elements for the HTTP representation are included.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the `to_bytes` function from `scrapy.utils.python` is used to ensure proper conversion to bytes. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is also used for the request body. The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions from `scrapy.utils.url` are imported and used to handle the URL parsing. These changes should fix the bug in the original function.
