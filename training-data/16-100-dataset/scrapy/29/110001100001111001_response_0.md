The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by using the `urlparse_cached` function, which is likely not returning the expected values. This leads to incorrect construction of the `path` variable, which in turn affects the construction of the `s` variable when creating the raw HTTP representation.

To fix the bug, we should use the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module instead of the `urlparse_cached` function. This will ensure that the `parsed` variable contains the correct values, which will then be used to construct the `path` and `s` variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected raw HTTP representation for the given request, as outlined in the provided test cases.
