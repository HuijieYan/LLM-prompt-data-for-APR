1. The buggy function takes a request object and attempts to convert it to its raw HTTP representation as bytes. It uses the urlparse_cached function to parse the request's URL and then constructs the HTTP representation based on the parsed components.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the handling of the request's headers and body.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of request headers and body, or potential issues in parsing the URL.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the request headers and body are properly encoded and concatenated with the HTTP representation.
   - Verifying that the URL parsing and construction are done correctly.
   - Handling edge cases where certain components of the request might be missing or invalid.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += to_bytes(header) + b": " + to_bytes(value) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- We import urlparse and urlunparse directly from urllib.parse.
- We handle the request headers by looping through them and concatenating each header and its value to the HTTP representation.
- We also handle the request body by adding it to the HTTP representation if it exists.
