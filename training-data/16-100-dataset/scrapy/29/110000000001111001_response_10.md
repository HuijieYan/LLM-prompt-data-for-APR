Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the "Host" header, as it is not being properly constructed for different types of URLs.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the fact that the "Host" header is not being constructed correctly for different types of URLs. It should use the "netloc" attribute from the parsed URL, rather than the "hostname" attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the code to use the "netloc" attribute from the parsed URL to construct the "Host" header.
2. Check for the presence of the "netloc" attribute in the parsed URL and reconstruct the "Host" header accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes
from twisted.web.http import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.netloc:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
