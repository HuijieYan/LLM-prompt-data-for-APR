The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the "parsed" variable and the construction of the "s" variable. It appears that the "parsed" variable is not being used correctly to construct the "path" and "s" variables, leading to incorrect output.

The "parsed" variable is being used to extract the path and hostname, but it should not be used to construct the path for the HTTP request, as it might contain additional information such as the scheme (e.g., "file" or "ftp"). Additionally, the "s" variable is being constructed using the incorrect path and hostname information, leading to a malformed HTTP request.

To fix the bug, the "parsed" variable should not be used to construct the path, and the "s" variable should be constructed using the correct path and hostname information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected function uses the urlparse function to correctly extract the path and hostname from the request URL. It then constructs the "s" variable using the correct path and hostname information, as well as the request method, headers, and body. This should resolve the issues with the buggy function and produce the expected output for the given input parameter values and types.
