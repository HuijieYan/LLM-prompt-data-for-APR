The potential error location within the problematic function is the `parsed.hostname` parameter, which is returning a `None` type value. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` since it expects a unicode, str, or bytes object, but received a NoneType.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is None and provide a default value instead.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six import text_type

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By handling the case when `parsed.hostname` is None and providing a default value instead (in this case, "localhost"), the corrected code should now pass the failing test.
