1. The buggy function takes a request object and tries to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the request. However, there are some issues in the function that need to be fixed.

2. The potential error location within the function is with the handling of the request.headers. It concatenates the headers to the byte string without properly encoding them, which can cause issues with non-ASCII characters.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle non-ASCII characters properly when concatenating the headers to the byte string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Encoding the headers properly before concatenating them with the byte string
   - Ensuring that non-ASCII characters are properly handled throughout the function

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import urllib.parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += key.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we encode the method, path, hostname, keys, and values to UTF-8 before concatenating them with the byte strings. We also iterate through the request headers and encode the keys and values before concatenating them. Additionally, we check if the request has a body before including it in the final byte string.
