The issue in the `request_httprepr` function is occurring when trying to concatenate a byte string with `parsed.hostname`, which is causing a `NoneType` error. This is likely happening because the `hostname` attribute is not present in the `parsed` object. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and provide a default value for the `Host` header when it is not present in the input URL.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: localhost\r\n"  # Provide a default value for Host header if it's not present in the URL
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the `Host` header. This should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the function to pass the failing test.
