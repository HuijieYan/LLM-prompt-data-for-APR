Buggy function analysis:

1. The `request_httprepr` function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request as bytes.
2. The potential error location within the function is where it concatenates different parts of the HTTP request into the `s` variable, such as the method, path, headers, and body.

Bug cause:

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the request body. In the original function, the request body is concatenated to the `s` variable without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to errors if the request body is empty or not present.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the request body exists before concatenating it to the `s` variable.
2. Properly handle the request body to ensure it is included in the raw HTTP representation if it exists.
3. Ensure that the function properly constructs the raw HTTP representation without any missing or extraneous components.

Corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += b"\r\n" + request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the request body is checked before concatenating it to the `s` variable. If the request body exists, it is properly included in the raw HTTP representation. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function constructs the raw HTTP representation correctly.
