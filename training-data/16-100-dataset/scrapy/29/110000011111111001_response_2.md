The main issue that is causing the error is that the parsed.hostname is None when the scheme of the URL is not HTTP. This causes an error when trying to concatenate it with other bytes.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to handle the case when the scheme is not HTTP. You can check if the scheme is HTTP before trying to include the Host header in the request.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)  # Replaced urlparse_cached with urlparse
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme.lower() == 'http':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body

    return s
```

With these changes, the function will now check the scheme of the URL and only include the Host header if it's an HTTP request. And based on the given failing tests and their expected output, this corrected version will satisfy the requirements.
