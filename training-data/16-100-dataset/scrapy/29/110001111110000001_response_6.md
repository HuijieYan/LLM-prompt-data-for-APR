The error is occurring within the `to_bytes` function call inside the `request_httprepr` function. The error message indicates that `parsed.hostname` is returning a `NoneType` value, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes, and if it is `None`, use an empty string instead.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` not being `None`, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
