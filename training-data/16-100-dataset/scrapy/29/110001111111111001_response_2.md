The issue in the buggy function `request_httprepr` is with the `parsed.hostname` variable, which is `None` for non-HTTP requests. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail, as it expects a string but is receiving `NoneType`.

To fix this, we can modify the function to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. In this case, we can use the `parsed.netloc` value instead, which contains the hostname and port information.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    else:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.netloc.split(":")[0])  # use netloc if hostname is None
    
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected code now handles the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by using `parsed.netloc` to extract the hostname and port information. This will ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `NoneType` and will fix the failing test.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
