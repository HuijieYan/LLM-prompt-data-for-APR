The potential error location within the `request_httprepr` function is the `parsed.hostname` variable, which is returning `None` when the request is not an HTTP request. This `None` value is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it's expecting a string, not `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for the `Host` header. Additionally, we can add a check to verify that the request is an HTTP request before attempting to access the `parsed` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    if request.scheme != 'http':
        return b''  # Return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests

    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will now return empty bytes for non-HTTP requests, which should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
