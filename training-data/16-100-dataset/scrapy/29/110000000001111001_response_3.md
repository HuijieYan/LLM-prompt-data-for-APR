The potential error in the buggy function is that it's using the wrong value for the "Host" header. It should be using the netloc from the parsed URL instead of the hostname directly from the request. This is evident from the discrepancy between the expected and actual output values for the "s" variable in both cases.

To fix this bug, we should change the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` to `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"` in the buggy function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import mimetools

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output based on the input parameters provided.
