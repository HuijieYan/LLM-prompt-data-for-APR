1. The buggy function takes a request object and tries to create the raw HTTP representation of the request, which includes the method, path, headers, and body.

2. The potential error location is in the concatenation of the request headers to the byte string 's'.

3. The bug's cause is that the function attempts to concatenate a byte string with a non-byte string type (headers). This can raise a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Convert the headers to bytes before concatenating them with the 's' string.
   - Ensure that all string concatenations are done with byte strings.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from twisted.web.client import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web._newclient import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the `to_bytes()` function is used to convert non-byte strings to byte strings before concatenating them. Additionally, the `to_bytes()` function is used to convert the request headers to bytes before concatenating them with the 's' string. This ensures that all string concatenations are done with byte strings, fixing the potential TypeError bug in the function.
