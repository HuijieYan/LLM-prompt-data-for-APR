The error occurs at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function. This is because `parsed.hostname` is `None` for a non-HTTP request. The `to_bytes` function called with a `None` value raises a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to add it to the `s` variable. We can achieve this by checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding it to `s`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before it is added to the `s` variable, fixing the `TypeError` that was occurring.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the function should behave as expected for non-HTTP requests.
