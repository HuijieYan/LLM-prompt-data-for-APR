1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The failing test is trying to test the function with a non-HTTP request, specifically 'file' and 'ftp' protocols. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a NoneType, which results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes using the `to_bytes` function, which results in a NoneType being passed to `to_bytes`.

3. The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being None in the case of non-HTTP requests, such as 'file' and 'ftp' protocols. This leads to the `to_bytes` function receiving a NoneType, which is not handled properly and results in a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if `parsed.hostname` is None before attempting to convert it to bytes.
   - Handling non-HTTP requests differently in the `request_httprepr` function.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function checks if `parsed.hostname` is not None before trying to convert it to bytes, preventing the TypeError encountered in the failing test. This corrected function should pass the failing test for non-HTTP requests.
