The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition for checking the `make_current` parameter. 

The function is supposed to set the current IOLoop, if it does not already exist, based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, in the current implementation, the condition for checking whether the current IOLoop exists is incorrect.

Here are the issues:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the `make_current` parameter being set to `True`. 
2. The condition `elif make_current` is not sufficient to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition to check if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Change the condition to properly handle the case where `make_current` is False and the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected function will properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None, True, or False and set the current IOLoop accordingly.
