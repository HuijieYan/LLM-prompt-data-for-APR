The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is True, it should check if the current IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does. However, the current implementation does not do this correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if the current IOLoop instance already exists, raising an error if it does.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and resolves the problem.
