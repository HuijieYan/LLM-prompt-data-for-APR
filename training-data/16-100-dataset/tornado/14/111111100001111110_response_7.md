The issue in the given code is with the logic of the `initialize` function. 

To fix the bug, we can update the `initialize` function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and then it will raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists. This resolves the issue of the function incorrectly raising an error when the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

The updated function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it also sets the current `IOLoop`.

The GitHub issue title for this bug:
```
Bug in initialize function of ioloop.py
```

The GitHub issue's detailed description:
```
The current logic in the initialize function leads to confusing behavior. It should be updated to correctly handle the make_current parameter and avoid raising an error when the current IOLoop does not exist.
