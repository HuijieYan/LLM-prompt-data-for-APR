The problem lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that when `make_current` is `True`, it attempts to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, it should make the current instance.

The issue arises from the fact that even if `make_current` is `True`, it doesn't check if the current instance already exists and directly calls `self.make_current()`. This can lead to a RuntimeError as observed in the failing test.

To fix this, the code should be modified to check if a current instance exists even when `make_current` is `True`, and only raise an error if the current instance already exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` method will first check if a current instance exists if `make_current` is `True`, and only then proceed to make the current instance. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
