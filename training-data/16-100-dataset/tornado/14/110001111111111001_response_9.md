The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` as a static method, but it should be calling `current(instance=False)` from the same file. 

To fix the bug, you need to update the call to the `current` function to use the correct scope.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
