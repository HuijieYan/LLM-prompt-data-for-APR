The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional block that checks if the current IOLoop exists and then raises a RuntimeError.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling the case where the current IOLoop already exists properly. The condition to check if the current IOLoop is None is incorrect and leads to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists. This solution should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
