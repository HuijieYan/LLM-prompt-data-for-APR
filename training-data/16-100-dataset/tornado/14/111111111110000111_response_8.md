The potential error location is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the `if make_current is None` condition. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.


The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This results in the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, then raise a `RuntimeError` immediately.
2. If `make_current` is True and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then set the instance as the current `IOLoop`.


Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test for the `IOLoop` class should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved. The code now correctly handles the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, ensuring that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
