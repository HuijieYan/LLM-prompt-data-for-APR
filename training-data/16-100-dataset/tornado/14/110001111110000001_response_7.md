The buggy function 'initialize' is designed to initialize the IOLoop. The issue lies in the 'initialize' function where the check for an existing IOLoop is incorrect. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised, which suggests that the condition for checking if an IOLoop already exists is not working as intended.

The code is attempting to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making a new one. The problem is that in the 'initialize' function, when 'make_current' is True, it does not correctly handle the situation where an IOLoop already exists. Instead of checking if an IOLoop instance exists, it is incorrectly checking if 'IOLoop.current(instance=False)' is None in both branches of the 'if' statement. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised when it shouldn't be.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'initialize' function to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when 'make_current' is True. We can do this by using the 'IOLoop.current' function and checking if it returns a non-None value.

The corrected code for the 'initialize' function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the 'initialize' function should correctly handle the situation where an IOLoop already exists when 'make_current' is True. This should make the failing test 'test_force_current' pass.
