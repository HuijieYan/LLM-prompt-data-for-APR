The buggy function is the "initialize" method of a class, and it takes a parameter "make_current." The function checks if "make_current" is None and if the current IOLoop is not already initialized, it calls the "make_current" method. If "make_current" is True, it checks if the current IOLoop is not already initialized and then calls the "make_current" method. If the current IOLoop is already initialized, it raises a RuntimeError.

The failing test "test_force_current" tries to instantiate an IOLoop with "make_current" set to True, then it checks if the current IOLoop is the newly created one and if a second attempt to create the current IOLoop with "make_current" set to True raises a RuntimeError.

The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when the current IOLoop is already initialized, which does not match the intended behavior according to the GitHub issue.

The potential error in the buggy function is in the block where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop and raises a RuntimeError. It seems that the logic for checking the current IOLoop is incorrect.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case where "make_current" is True and the current IOLoop is already initialized properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to only call the "make_current" method if "make_current" is True and the current IOLoop is not already initialized. If "make_current" is None, we can also check if the current IOLoop is not already initialized before calling "self.make_current()".

Here is the corrected code for the "initialize" method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where "make_current" is True and the current IOLoop is already initialized properly. This should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
