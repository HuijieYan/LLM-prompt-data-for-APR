The bug is located in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This means that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is failing in this case.

The `IOLoop.current` method is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. The `initialize` function is supposed to make the current `IOLoop` instance only if `make_current` is `True`. However, the bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the cases of `make_current` being `None` or `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance and either make the current `IOLoop` or raise a `RuntimeError` based on the value of `make_current`. This should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
