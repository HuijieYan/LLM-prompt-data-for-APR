1. The buggy function "initialize" is checking if the "make_current" argument is None and then calling the related function "make_current". However, the function "make_current" is not called correctly using the "self" reference. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the "make_current" function is being called.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function is not calling the "make_current" function correctly.
   (b) The "make_current" function is not being referenced using the "self" parameter.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Ensure that the "make_current" function is called with the correct reference.
   (b) Use the "self" parameter to refer to the "make_current" function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
