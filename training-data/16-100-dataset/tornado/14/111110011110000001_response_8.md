1. The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. When it tries to do so, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional checks for `make_current`. It seems like the conditional statements are not producing the desired behavior.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it should ensure that the current IOLoop does not already exist. However, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are not achieving this as evidenced by the failing test.
   (b). The `IOLoop` class contains the `make_current` method which is related to setting up the current IOLoop instance.
   (c). The failing test itself is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and the error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the conditional checks in the `initialize` function are properly verifying if the current IOLoop exists or not.
   (b). Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function will correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop and ensure that it follows the specified behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`. This code should pass the failing test.
