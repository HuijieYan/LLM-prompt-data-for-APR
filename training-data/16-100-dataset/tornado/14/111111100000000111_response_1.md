Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` argument is None, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if a current IOLoop already exists. If it does not exist, the function calls `self.make_current()`. If the `make_current` argument is True, it also checks if a current IOLoop exists, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The related functions `IOLoop.current()` and `self.make_current()` are used internally to check and set the current IOLoop.

The GitHub issue points out that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None in the `initialize` function, it is unclear why the `RuntimeError` "already exists" is being raised.

Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, specifically in the conditional checks for `make_current`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the `initialize` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the conditional checks for `make_current` and the corresponding calls to `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` to ensure consistent and expected behavior.
2. Clarify the code and comments to explain the intended logic for the `initialize` function and the handling of the `make_current` argument.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
