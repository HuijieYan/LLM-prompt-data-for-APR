The buggy function is `initialize` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. The function takes an input parameter `make_current` and calls the functions `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` based on its value. The failing test `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` creates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even though the `IOLoop.current` is `None`. This means that the condition to raise the `RuntimeError` is being met incorrectly.

The root cause of the bug is that the condition to raise the `RuntimeError` is not correctly checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to properly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before deciding whether to make it current or raise an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and act accordingly.

This corrected code should pass the failing test `test_force_current` and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub with the title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None".
