The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the `initialize` method where it checks for the current IOLoop instance. The error seems to be occurring when `make_current` is True and it is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None or not. If it is not None, it raises a RuntimeError even though it should just call `self.make_current()`.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument and its interaction with the existing IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` method to always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True and to remove the conditional check for the existing IOLoop instance being None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This code ensures that when `make_current` is True, it always calls `self.make_current()` and when `make_current` is not specified, it raises a RuntimeError.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub by preventing the unnecessary check for the existing IOLoop instance.

The corrected function should now function properly and satisfy the requirements provided.
