1. The buggy function `initialize` is trying to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, create a new one using the `make_current` function. It is also checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raising an error if `make_current` is True.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the if-else logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and the condition for checking if `make_current` is True.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `initialize` is not using the correct function `current` to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, and the logic for checking the value of `make_current` is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include using the correct function to check for the current IOLoop instance and updating the logic for checking the value of `make_current`.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
