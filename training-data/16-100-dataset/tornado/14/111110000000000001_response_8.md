1. The buggy function is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which controls whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance. The function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it either makes the new instance current or raises an error if `make_current` is set to True.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statements that check whether to make the new instance current or raise an error.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling the case where `make_current` is False and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, as well as the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to handle the case where `make_current` is False and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, to avoid making the new instance current unnecessarily.
   - Modify the condition for the case where `make_current` is True to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance current.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
```
