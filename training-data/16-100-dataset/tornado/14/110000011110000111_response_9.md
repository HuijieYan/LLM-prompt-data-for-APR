The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is None. If `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and raises a RuntimeError if it is not.

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then asserts that it is the current IOLoop instance. Then it tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a RuntimeError, which it does. However, it also expects the first IOLoop instance to remain the current instance, which is not the case based on the error message and the GitHub issue description.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is at the check for `make_current` not being None and evaluating to True. It should only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is None.

The bug is caused by the fact that even if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is not None, it still tries to create a new IOLoop instance and raises a RuntimeError, leading to the GitHub issue posted.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

With this correction, the function will only attempt to create the current IOLoop instance if it is None and `make_current` is True. This change should make the function pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
