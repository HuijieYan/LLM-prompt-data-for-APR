The problem with the buggy function seems to be at line 252, specifically with the conditional check for `make_current`. The `make_current` argument is True, but the if condition is not being satisfied, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The cause of the bug seems to be an issue with the conditional checks for the `make_current` argument and the `IOLoop.current()` function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check for `make_current` and ensure that the `IOLoop.current()` function is being called correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the conditional checks for `make_current` are now correctly handling the cases where it's `None` or `True`. Additionally, the `IOLoop.current()` function is being called in the correct condition to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
