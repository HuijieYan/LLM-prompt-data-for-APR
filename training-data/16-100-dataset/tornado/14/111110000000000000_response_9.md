Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

This version addresses the following issues:
1. Removed the redundant `if make_current is None` condition and simplified the logic.
2. Eliminated the need for the `current` function as it is not used in the `initialize` method.
