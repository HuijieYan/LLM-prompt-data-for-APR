The bug in the `initialize` method seems to be related to the logic for checking whether a current IOLoop already exists. Currently, if `make_current` is set to `True`, it will always raise a `RuntimeError`, even if there is no current IOLoop.

The issue seems to be with how the check for an existing current IOLoop is handled. The code checks for `make_current` being `True` and if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. However, this logic is flawed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly check if a current IOLoop already exists and handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance is now handled correctly. The `make_current` argument is also appropriately processed based on whether or not a current IOLoop already exists.

This updated logic will ensure that the `initialize` method works as expected and passes the failing test scenario.
