The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking and handling the `make_current` parameter. Additionally, it is not calling the related functions `IOLoop.current()` and `self.make_current()` properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` function where it checks for the `make_current` parameter and calls the related functions.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
(a). The buggy function is not handling the `make_current` parameter properly.
(b). The related functions `IOLoop.current()` and `self.make_current()` are not being called correctly.
(c). The expected input is `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, so it should call `self.make_current()`. However, the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.
(d). The GitHub issue also points out that there is a discrepancy in the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and call the related functions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this corrected code:
- When `make_current` is `None` or `True`, it will check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and call `self.make_current()` if needed.
- When `make_current` is `False`, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as per the GitHub issue.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
