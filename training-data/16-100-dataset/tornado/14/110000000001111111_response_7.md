The potential error in the function is at line 4, where it is checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. It should be checking if it is not None in order to raise an error. This error is causing the function to incorrectly raise a RuntimeError when make_current is True, even if an IOLoop.current instance exists.

The bug's cause is the incorrect conditional check at line 4, which is causing the function to incorrectly raise an error when it should not.

To fix the bug, we should change the conditional check at line 4 to check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, and then raise a RuntimeError if it is not None when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will work as expected based on the provided input/output variable information, and it will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
