The issue in the `initialize` function is that it checks if `make_current` is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()`. However, it should also execute `self.make_current()` if the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

To fix the bug, we can remove the check for `make_current is None` and simply call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is not `None` or `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None and make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function should now pass the failing test and handle the input parameters as expected.
