1. The buggy function is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance, but it has a logical error in the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop.

2. The potential error is in the condition where it checks if the IOLoop is not present, but it doesn't actually initialize it correctly, leading to the possibility of a runtime error.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop. It does not handle the case where the IOLoop does not exist properly.

4. To fix the bug, we can refactor the function to explicitly initialize the IOLoop when it is not present, and raise an error if it is already initialized when it should not be.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we check if `make_current` is None and if the current instance is None, we initialize the IOLoop. If `make_current` is True, we check if the current instance is not None, and if it is, we raise a RuntimeError. The function should now work as intended.
