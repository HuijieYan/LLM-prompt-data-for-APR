Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the `initialize` function within the `tornado/ioloop.py` file, specifically in the logic related to the `make_current` parameter.

Bug's cause:
- The `initialize` function takes a `make_current` parameter, and if it is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop already exists. If it does not exist, it creates a new one.
- However, in the failing test, the `IOLoop` object is initialized with `make_current=True`, and it checks if the current IOLoop exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`, but this is contradictory to the logic in the `initialize` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Change the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
- Remove the conflicting logic and ensure that the `make_current` parameter is being used as intended.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
