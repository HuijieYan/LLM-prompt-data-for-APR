The bug in the `initialize` function is causing an issue when `make_current` is set to `True`. The problem occurs because even though the `make_current` argument is `True`, the function is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before raising a `RuntimeError`. This is causing the function to incorrectly raise an error when it should not.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic in the `initialize` function. Instead of using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` as a condition, we should directly check if `make_current` is `True` and then call `self.make_current()`. Additionally, if `make_current` is `None`, we should make the current `IOLoop` instance if there isn't one already.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This revised logic ensures that the `make_current` argument is correctly handled and the function will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't.

With this fix, the function will now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is managed appropriately.

The GitHub issue can be addressed with this fix by explaining the revised logic and the changes made to the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` argument properly. This will resolve the discrepancy and ensure that `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
