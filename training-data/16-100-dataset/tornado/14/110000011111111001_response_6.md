The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the `make_current` check.

The bug's cause is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, then make it the current one. However, the current logic is incorrect and raises an error if there is no current IOLoop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Change the logic for the `make_current` check to first see if the current IOLoop exists, and if not, then make it the current one.
- Remove the unnecessary `if make_current is None` check.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
