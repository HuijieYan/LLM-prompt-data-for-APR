The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is responsible for setting the current IOLoop and raising an error if there is already a current instance. The bug seems to be related to the logic of checking the current IOLoop instance and raising an error when `make_current` is set to `True`. The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" suggests that there is a contradiction in the logic at line 252. 

The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where the conditions for setting the current IOLoop and raising the error are being checked.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if the current IOLoop instance does not exist, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError. This contradicts the purpose of setting `make_current` to `True`, which is to make the new IOLoop the current instance.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the check for the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first obtain the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then we properly check if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and handle the logic accordingly. If `make_current` is `None`, we check if the current instance exists and make the new IOLoop the current instance if it doesn't. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current instance exists and raise an error if it does, otherwise, we make the new IOLoop the current instance.

This correction resolves the contradiction in the logic and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
