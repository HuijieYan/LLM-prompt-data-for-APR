The issue in the buggy function lies in the initialize method. When make_current is True, the function checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is None, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory, as the intention seems to be that if current IOLoop already exists, then it should raise a RuntimeError.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to a logical error in the if-else conditions within the initialize method. When make_current is True, it should check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, and if it is not None, then it should raise a RuntimeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified in the initialize method as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the initialize method now correctly handles the make_current parameter, and the bug should be resolved. This corrected code ensures that the failing test will pass and also aligns with the issue reported on GitHub.
