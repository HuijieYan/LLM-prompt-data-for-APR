Potential error location: The statement `if make_current is None` should be `if make_current is not None`.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop`, and when it is `False`, it should not try to set the current `IOLoop`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is not None`.
2. Update the `initialize` function to set the current `IOLoop` based on the value of `make_current`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
