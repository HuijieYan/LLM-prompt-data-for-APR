Potential error location:
The potential error location in the initialize function is the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop instance is None or not None, and then subsequently raises an error if the condition is not met.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function:
The initialize function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None or not and then raises a RuntimeError if the condition is not met.

(b). The buggy class:
The IOLoop class is responsible for creating and managing I/O loops.

(c). Related functions:
The current and make_current functions are related functions used within the IOLoop class.

(d). GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue states that on line 252, the expression IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, then questions why the error "already exists" is being raised.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the conditional statement in the initialize function to properly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance is None or not None, and then raise an error accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class members and methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, we store the result of IOLoop.current(instance=False) in a variable current_instance. Then, we check the value of current_instance and accordingly perform the necessary action, either making the current IOLoop or raising an error if it already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
