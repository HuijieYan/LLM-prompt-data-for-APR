The issue in the `initialize` function is that it's referencing the `IOLoop` class directly, but it should be using the `self` parameter to access the `current` and `make_current` functions.

Based on the input parameter `make_current`, if it is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it should raise the `RuntimeError` as it currently does. If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, it should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if so, call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current is False:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected based on the given input parameters and produce the correct output.
