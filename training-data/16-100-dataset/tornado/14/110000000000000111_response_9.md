The buggy function "initialize" is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that on line 252, the function IOLoop.current(instance=False) is returning None, and then the code raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists". This inconsistency indicates a potential bug in the code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub confirms that the check for the current IOLoop instance is not functioning as expected.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the IOLoop.current(instance=False) returns None. Instead of raising an error when make_current is True, it should initialize a new IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) returns None. If make_current is True, it should create a new IOLoop instance. If make_current is False, it should set the IOLoop current instance to None. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Set the IOLoop current instance to None
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub by correctly handling the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) returns None and addressing the inconsistency in the function's behavior.
