The issue seems to be with the logic of the `initialize` function. The function is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance, but the current logic is causing issues.

The problem seems to be with the `make_current()` method, but it's not clear how it's implemented. However, based on the current logic, it seems that `make_current` should be a method of the class and not an input parameter.

The GitHub issue mentions that the function is raising "current IOLoop already exists" even when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. This suggests that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as expected.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the `make_current` input parameter from the function signature.
2. Check if the current IOLoop does not exist and then create one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self):
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()  # Assuming make_current is a method of the class
```

By making these changes, the function will create an IOLoop instance only if it does not exist, and the issue mentioned in the GitHub report will be resolved.
