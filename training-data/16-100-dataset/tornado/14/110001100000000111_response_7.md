The problematic function `initialize` is responsible for initializing an IOLoop instance. It takes an optional `make_current` parameter, which defaults to None. If `make_current` is None, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. If not, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if` statement that checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. If it is, it should call `self.make_current()`. However, the else block that follows is incorrectly checking for the same condition again.

The bug's cause is that the logic to check if an IOLoop instance already exists is not properly implemented. It is checking the condition twice, leading to a logic error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if-else conditions to properly handle the logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists. We can remove the redundant if-else statements and simplify the logic to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code handles the logic for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists. It first checks if `make_current` is None or True, and then it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not None. If it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it calls `self.make_current()` to create a new IOLoop instance. This code resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
