The problem in the given code is probably due to the incorrect implementation of the `initialize` method. It is trying to use `make_current` as a flag to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists, but the logic is flawed.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, it will check if a current `IOLoop` already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. Then it will call `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `False`, it will do nothing.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
