1. The buggy function "initialize" is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop and making it the current one if it doesn't exist. It also checks if a custom make_current function is provided and uses it if so. The related functions "current" and "make_current" are used to get the current IOLoop instance and make a particular IOLoop the current one, respectively.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current IOLoop and the make_current function.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function does not properly handle the case when make_current is provided as an argument but is not truthy.
   (b). The function is incorrectly using IOLoop.current() instead of the local function current().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use the local function current() instead of IOLoop.current().
   b. Update the conditional statements to properly handle the make_current argument.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        # use the local function instead of IOLoop.current()
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
