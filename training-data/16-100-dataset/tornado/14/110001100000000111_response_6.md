The issue lies in the initialize function in the ioloop.py file. The problem stems from the logic used to check if the IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None or not when make_current is None or not None. The GitHub issue highlights that when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, it shouldn't raise "already exists".

The potential error location is within the if-else statements that check the value of make_current and the existence of the current IOLoop.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the initialize function to properly handle the cases where make_current is None or not None.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # No need to check make_current, as it's not None
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we removed the unnecessary check for make_current when it's None, as we can directly handle the case where make_current is not None. We also fixed the logic for raising the RuntimeError by checking if the current IOLoop is not None before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent the incorrect "already exists" RuntimeError from being raised when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.
