The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the `if` and `elif` statements. The first condition checks if `make_current` is None and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The second condition checks if `make_current` is True and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. Both conditions are redundant and the logic is not implemented correctly.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic used in the `initialize` function. It attempts to check the current instance of the `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, but the logic is flawed and does not properly handle the scenario. 

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be simplified to directly handle the setting of the current `IOLoop` instance. It should check if `make_current` is True and set the current instance accordingly. If `make_current` is None or False, it should not attempt to change the current instance.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other code in the class is omitted for brevity

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
With this corrected code, the `initialize` function will simply set the current instance of the `IOLoop` when `make_current` is True, and it will do nothing if `make_current` is None or False.
