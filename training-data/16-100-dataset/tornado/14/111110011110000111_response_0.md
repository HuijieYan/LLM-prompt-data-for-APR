Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug is located within the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The error is being triggered when `make_current` is True, and it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists". However, the condition is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop is None when it should be checking if it is not None.

The bug's cause is that the if condition in the `initialize` function is checking if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it tries to make the current IOLoop using `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, it should raise an error, but the condition is not checking for that correctly.

To fix this bug, the condition in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. It should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True, and if it is not None, it should raise a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists".

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
