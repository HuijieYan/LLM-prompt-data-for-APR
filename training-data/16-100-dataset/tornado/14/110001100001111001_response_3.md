The bug in the initialize function lies in the condition statements. The condition `if make_current is None:` should be changed to `if make_current == None:` in order to properly check whether the make_current argument is None. Additionally, the function IOLoop.current(instance=False) should be called using the module name to refer to the correct function.

Here is the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current == None:
        if ioloop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if ioloop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the initialize function should now handle the make_current argument correctly and eliminate the bug.
