## Analysis
The problem with the buggy function is that it is checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance in multiple places and may incorrectly make the current IOLoop instance when it is not necessary.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional checks for the presence of the current IOLoop instance. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, but there is already a current IOLoop instance.

## Possible Approaches
1. Check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance at the start of the function and make it the current instance if it does not exist.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, check if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_instance is None and (make_current is None or make_current):
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
