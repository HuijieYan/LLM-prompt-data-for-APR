The problem lies in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is caused by a logic flaw in the if-else condition when checking for the `make_current` parameter.

The problem occurs when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. In this case, the function should not raise a RuntimeError because the current IOLoop does not exist. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, only then raise a RuntimeError.
2. If `make_current` is None, then check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and if so, make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is False, do not attempt to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub should also be resolved.
