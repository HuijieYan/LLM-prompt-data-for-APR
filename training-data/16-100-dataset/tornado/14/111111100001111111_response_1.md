The issue in the code lies in the `initialize` function. The problem is with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is None, the code either makes the current instance or raises an error, depending on the value of the `make_current` parameter.

The bug is causing a conflict because the condition is contradictory. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is indeed None, the code should proceed to make the current instance, but instead, it tries to raise an error if `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, the condition needs to be modified to check for the opposite condition and remove the redundant if-else block. The `make_current` parameter can be checked directly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This code first checks if `make_current` is None and then directly checks the value of `make_current` to decide whether to raise an error or make the current instance. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` has replaced the original condition, as it is more suitable in this context.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
