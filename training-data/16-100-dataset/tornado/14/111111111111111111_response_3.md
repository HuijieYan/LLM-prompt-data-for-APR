The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it should raise a RuntimeError if there's already a current IOLoop. However, the current logic is not handling this case correctly.

The potential error location is in the `initialize()` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block.

The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the function is not correctly checking if there's already a current IOLoop before trying to make itself the current IOLoop.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True. We should check if there's already a current IOLoop and raise a RuntimeError if there is, or make the current IOLoop otherwise.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True, and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.

The updated code includes the correct handling of the `make_current` parameter, checking for the presence of a current IOLoop instance before attempting to make the current IOLoop.

This updated version of the code ensures that the logic in the `initialize()` function aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug.
