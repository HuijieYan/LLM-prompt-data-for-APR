The bug in the provided code is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue is that the condition to check for the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the IOLoop already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, and then asserts that the current IOLoop is the one that was created. However, the RuntimeError is raised, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists, which is not the expected behavior.

The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" suggests that there is inconsistency in checking whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix this bug, the condition to check for the existence of the current IOLoop needs to be corrected to accurately determine if the IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` ensures that the `RuntimeError` will only be raised if the current IOLoop actually exists when trying to create a new one.

This corrected code should resolve the issue identified in the failing test and GitHub issue. It will now accurately check for the existence of the current IOLoop and act accordingly.
