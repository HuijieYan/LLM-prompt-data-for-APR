Potential error location: The potential error is in the `initialize` function at lines 7-14 of the provided buggy code.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it sets it as the current IOLoop. However, if `make_current` is True, it checks again if the current IOLoop instance is None and raises a RuntimeError if it is not None.
(b). The `current` function is intended to return the current IOLoop instance. 
(c). The GitHub issue indicates that line 252 of the code is checking the current instance but then later raises an error for an already existing IOLoop, which is contradictory.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the redundant check for current IOLoop instance in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is True.
2. Use the `make_current` function to make the current IOLoop instance without checking for its existence.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

The above corrected code removes the redundant check for the current IOLoop instance and directly calls the `make_current` function to make the current IOLoop instance. It also handles the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists by raising a RuntimeError. This corrected code satisfies the GitHub issue and resolves the potential bug.
