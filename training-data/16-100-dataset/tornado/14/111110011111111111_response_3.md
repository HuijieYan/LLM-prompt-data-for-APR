The issue in the `initialize` function seems to be that when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then raises an error if it is `None`. This is contradictory and causes the test to fail.

The erroneous part of the code is:
```python
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditional statements not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to remove the contradictory condition and handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `make_current` is `True`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it will raise an error. If `make_current` is not provided or is `False`, it will simply call `self.make_current()`.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, these changes should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
