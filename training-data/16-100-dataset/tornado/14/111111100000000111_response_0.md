The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and it is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the comparison of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `None` and then raising "already exists" error. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
if make_current is None:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```
This block of code should actually check if `make_current` is `True` and not `None`.

The bug's cause is that the comparison within the `initialize` function does not align with the intended logic. The GitHub issue indicates that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, the function should not be raising "already exists" error.

To fix the bug, the comparison within the `initialize` function should be modified to check if `make_current` is `True` and then handle the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
