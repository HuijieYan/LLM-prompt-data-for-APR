Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically within the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current`.

Bug's Cause:
The `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is None and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is True, it also checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

Potential Fix:
The issue occurs because in the `initialize` method, it is not necessary to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None when `make_current` is True. The existing check raises a `RuntimeError` even when a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

The corrected code for the `initialize` method should simply call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is None or True, without checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.

The corrected function has been simplified to directly call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is None or True, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
