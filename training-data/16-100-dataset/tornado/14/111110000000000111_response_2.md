The buggy function `initialize` is located in the `IOLoop` class and is called with an optional argument `make_current`. The function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if so, calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If not, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if a current instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does, otherwise it calls the `make_current` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `make_current` being `None` and then the subsequent check for a current `IOLoop` instance. This logic is not handling the case properly when `make_current` is `None`.

The bug's cause is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `None`. The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" highlights this inconsistency in the code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `None`. This can be done by checking if `make_current` is `None` and then simply calling the `make_current` method, without the need for the conditional check for a current instance.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code will properly handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and will call the `make_current` method without unnecessary conditional checks. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
