The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then checks if it is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. It expects an error to be raised when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`, but the error message indicates that the existing `IOLoop` instance is not being detected correctly.

The potential error location is around the if conditions inside the `initialize` function, where it checks the value of `make_current`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The code is not correctly checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance the current one. This leads to the error being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance the current one.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance the current one. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
