Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

The changes made include:
1. Added a check if `make_current` is `True` in the `elif` condition.
2. Changed the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` to check if the IOLoop already exists. If it does, then raise the `RuntimeError`. If it doesn't, then proceed with `self.make_current()`.
