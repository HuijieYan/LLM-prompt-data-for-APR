1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the class `IOLoop`. It calls the functions `current` and `make_current` from the same class. These functions seem to be incorrectly calling the functions with the same name from the global scope. 

2. The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, where it calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the `IOLoop` class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `initialize` method are not called from the class itself, but from the global scope, which may lead to incorrect behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `current` and `make_current` functions from the class itself, and not from the global scope.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super(IOLoop, self).__init__()

    @classmethod
    def current(cls, instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, I've made the `current` function a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator, and I've modified the calls to `current` and `make_current` to call the functions from the `self` instance. This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
