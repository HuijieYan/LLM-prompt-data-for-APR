1. The buggy function `initialize` is taking in an argument `make_current` and based on its value, it is either calling the function `make_current` or raising a RuntimeError. It also calls the function `current` from the same file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when checking for the existence of current IOLoop instance and calling the `make_current` function based on the value of `make_current` argument.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking for the existence of current IOLoop instance and calling the `make_current` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly check for the existence of current IOLoop instance
   - Call the `make_current` function based on the value of `make_current` argument

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking the existence of current IOLoop instance has been fixed, and the `make_current` function is called based on the correct condition.
