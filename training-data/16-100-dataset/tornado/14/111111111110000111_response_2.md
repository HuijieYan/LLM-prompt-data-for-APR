1. The problematic function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. The function initializes the `IOLoop` and handles the `make_current` argument. The failing test, `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`, tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` if another `IOLoop` instance already exists. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised even when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is unexpected. The GitHub issue also mentions this discrepancy.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if make_current is None` block and the `elif make_current` block. The `RuntimeError` is raised in the `elif make_current` block when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which indicates that the logic in this block is incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `elif make_current` block is not correctly handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic in the `elif make_current` block to handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` appropriately.
   - Ensure that the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` only raises a `RuntimeError` if another current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected code, the `initialize` function will now handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` properly and only raise a `RuntimeError` if another current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This will resolve the issue and the failing test should pass as expected.
