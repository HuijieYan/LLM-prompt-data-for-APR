Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is a method of a class (presumably an IOLoop class). It takes an argument `make_current` which can be `None` or a boolean value. The logic of this function seems to be that if `make_current` is `None`, it will call `make_current()` if no current IOLoop exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it will check if a current IOLoop exists and raise an error if it does. The failing test "test_force_current" tries to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True` expecting an error.

Error Location:
The potential error seems to be in the logic related to `make_current=True`. It should not raise an error if a current IOLoop exists, as the intention seems to be to force the creation of a new IOLoop.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the logic related to `make_current=True` is not working as expected. It checks for the existence of a current IOLoop, but it does not handle the case where `make_current=True` is used to force the creation of a new IOLoop.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the logic to handle `make_current=True` appropriately, ensuring that it always creates a new IOLoop, regardless of whether a current IOLoop exists or not.
2. Modify the `initialize` method to handle the case of `make_current=True` by creating a new IOLoop instance regardless of the current state.

Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # Always create a new IOLoop when make_current is True
```

This corrected code ensures that when `make_current=True` is passed to `initialize`, it always creates a new IOLoop instance, regardless of the current state. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
