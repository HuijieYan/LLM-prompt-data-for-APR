The issue with the buggy function lies in the way it handles the `make_current` argument and checks for the current IOLoop. The function should ensure that the `make_current` argument is treated as expected and the logic for checking the current IOLoop is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By using `self.current` instead of `IOLoop.current`, the function will correctly check for the current IOLoop within the instance. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument has been fixed to ensure it behaves as expected.
