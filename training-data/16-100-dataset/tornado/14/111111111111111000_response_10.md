The issue with the initialize() function is that it is unable to correctly handle the situation where make_current=True is passed as an argument. The logic for handling make_current as True is incorrect. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the initialize() function to correctly handle the make_current argument. Here's the corrected version of the initialize() function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        IOLoop.make_current(instance=False)
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            IOLoop.make_current(instance=True)
```

With this modification, the initialize() function will correctly handle the make_current argument, ensuring that the appropriate IOLoop instance becomes the current IOLoop based on the argument passed.
