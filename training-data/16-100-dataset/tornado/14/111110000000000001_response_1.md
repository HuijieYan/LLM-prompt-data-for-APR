1. The buggy function is part of a class called IOLoop, which is responsible for managing a level-triggered I/O loop. The function initialize() is used to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if necessary.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check the value of make_current.

3. (a). The buggy function 'initialize' is trying to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance by checking the value of the 'make_current' parameter. However, the conditional statements are not correctly handling the case when make_current is None.
   (b). The buggy class IOLoop contains a function called current() which returns the current IOLoop instance, and a function called make_current() which makes the current instance of IOLoop.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements in the initialize() function to correctly handle the case when make_current is None and to appropriately check for the presence of the current IOLoop instance. Additionally, we need to ensure that the make_current() function is called when necessary.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods and documentation)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance and store it in the variable current_instance. Then we check the value of make_current and the presence of the current IOLoop instance, and based on that we make the necessary calls to make_current() and handle potential RuntimeError when the current IOLoop already exists.
