The problematic function "initialize" is intended to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes an optional parameter "make_current." The bug seems to be related to the conditional logic surrounding the "make_current" parameter.

The problem lies in the if-else block within the initialize function. When make_current is True, it checks whether the IOLoop is not None (existing) and then tries to make it current. However, when make_current is None, it also tries to make it current if the current IOLoop is None. This inconsistency leads to the bug.

The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" suggests a confusion on whether the IOLoop is None or not, leading to the "already exists" error.

To fix this issue, we can simplify the logic in the "initialize" function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is True:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop using the `IOLoop.current` function. Then, we use if-elif conditions to handle the cases where `make_current` is True or None. If `make_current` is True, we check if the current IOLoop exists and raise an error if it does. If `make_current` is None, we check if the current IOLoop does not exist, and then make it current. This logic ensures consistent behavior based on the value of `make_current`.
