The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` exists and whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue seems to be that the logic is inverted in the if-else block, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `make_current` is `True`. This is indicated by the GitHub issue title, which suggests a discrepancy in the condition and the resulting error.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking whether the current `IOLoop` exists and whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be adjusted.

One approach for fixing the bug is to invert the condition in the if-else block so that when `make_current` is `True`, the `IOLoop.current` is checked for being `None`. When `make_current` is `None`, the current `IOLoop` instance should be made if it doesn't exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will behave as expected based on the provided input/output variable information, and it will successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
