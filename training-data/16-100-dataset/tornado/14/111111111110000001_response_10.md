1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop.py` file. The related functions are `current` and `make_current`, also within the `IOLoop` class. The failing test is testing the `make_current` argument with the `IOLoop` class and is expecting that calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` raises a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the condition `if make_current` where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop`. This condition is not checking the necessary conditions to ensure that a new instance of `IOLoop` is allowed to become the current instance.

3. The bug's cause is that the make_current argument is not being handled correctly in the `initialize` method. It should ensure that a current `IOLoop` can only be set if it does not already exist.

4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to properly handle the `make_current` argument, checking for an existing current `IOLoop` and raising a `RuntimeError` if necessary.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None or not make_current:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
