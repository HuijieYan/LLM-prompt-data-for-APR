1. The initialize function is calling the make_current function, but it is not referencing it correctly, and it is also referencing the current function from the same file, but not the same class. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the make_current() function call.

3. The bug's cause can be identified as follows:
   (a) The buggy function is trying to call the make_current function using self, but it is not referenced correctly.
   (b) The current function is being called from the IOLoop class, but it is not being referenced correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Use the correct referencing for the make_current function within the initialize function.
   (b) Use the correct referencing for the current function within the initialize function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The related functions are kept the same

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the make_current function and the current function are referenced correctly using the correct syntax for calling functions from the same file.
