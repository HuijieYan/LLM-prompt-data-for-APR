Potential Error Location: The if-else condition in the initialize function is causing the bug. When make_current is True, the code is trying to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is incorrect and causing the test to fail.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the make_current parameter in the initialize function. The logic to check for the existence of the IOLoop instance and raise a RuntimeError is not needed and is causing the failure.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary if-else conditions and simplify the logic based on the make_current parameter.
2. Instead of checking for the existence of the IOLoop instance, directly call the make_current function based on the value of make_current parameter.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will correctly handle the make_current parameter and call the make_current function based on its value, thereby fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
