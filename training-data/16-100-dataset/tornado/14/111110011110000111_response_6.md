1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method is used to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. The failing test function is testing the behavior of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current` argument set to `True`. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it shouldn't be.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if make_current is None` block and the `elif make_current` block. These blocks are checking the value of `make_current` and then attempting to make the current `IOLoop`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` method is not handling the `make_current` argument correctly. It is incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` exists and then trying to make it current, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised when it shouldn't be.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding proper condition checks for the `make_current` argument and the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
   - Modifying the logic to handle the `make_current` argument in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other methods and class members

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_loop is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and current_loop:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            elif make_current:
                self.make_current()
```

This corrected code includes proper checks for the `make_current` argument and the existence of the current `IOLoop`. It also aligns with the expected behavior and should pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
