The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create two instances of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, but it should raise a `RuntimeError` on the second attempt.

The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the `elif make_current` block where the `RuntimeError` is being raised.

The bug's cause is that the `elif make_current` block should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a truthy value. However, the current code is raising the `RuntimeError` unconditionally in that block.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `elif make_current` block to only raise the `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and it resolves the issue posted on GitHub about `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returning `None` but still raising "current IOLoop already exists".
