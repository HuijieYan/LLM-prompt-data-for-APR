#### Bug Analysis

The problematic function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. It takes a parameter `make_current` which, when set to `True`, is supposed to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then check if the current IOLoop is the one just created. However, it fails with a `RuntimeError` indicating that "current IOLoop already exists".

The related functions `current` and `make_current` are not directly causing the bug, but they are intended to be called within the `initialize` method.

The GitHub issue title indicates a confusion about the condition that leads to the `RuntimeError`, hinting at a problem with the logic related to the `make_current` parameter.

#### Bug Location
The potential error location within the problematic function is the if-else condition for `make_current`. It seems that the logic is not checking for the current IOLoop instance properly, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

#### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not being evaluated correctly. It should check if a current IOLoop instance exists and then perform the necessary action based on that check. However, the current implementation is not doing that correctly, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

#### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance to accurately determine if it already exists or not.
2. Adjust the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter to ensure that the correct action is taken based on the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

#### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` issue and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
