The problem lies in the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The issue occurs because the condition for checking whether the IOLoop.current instance is None is incorrect leading to a wrong `RuntimeError` being raised.

The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the actual `RuntimeError` message suggests that the current IOLoop already exists, which is incorrect.

The GitHub issue points to line 252, suggesting that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `initialize` function to properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Fixed line
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By replacing `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `self.current(instance=False)` and adjusting the condition for checking if the IOLoop instance exists, the bug can be fixed.

With this correction, the failing test should pass without raising the `RuntimeError`, and it should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
