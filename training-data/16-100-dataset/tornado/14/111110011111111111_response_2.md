The issue is occurring because when the `make_current` argument is True, the function is attempting to check if the current `IOLoop` exists before making the current `IOLoop` instance. But the conditional check is incorrect and is raising a `RuntimeError` even when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check when `make_current` is True. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional check for `make_current` will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` when the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` only when the current `IOLoop` already exists. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and in the GitHub issue.
