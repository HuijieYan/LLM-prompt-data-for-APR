# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to `if make_current is None or make_current`, we can properly handle the case where `make_current` is True. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and should fix the bug.
