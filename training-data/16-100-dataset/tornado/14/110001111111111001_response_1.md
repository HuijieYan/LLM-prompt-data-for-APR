Potential Bug Location:
The bug seems to be in the logic of the conditional statements within the `initialize` function. Specifically, the condition to check if `make_current` is True or not is not being properly handled.

Bug Cause:
The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is True, it tries to check if the current IOLoop exists, but it does not actually call `self.make_current()` in this case, which leads to the RuntimeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic within the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True.
2. Ensure that `self.make_current()` is called when `make_current` is True.

Corrected Code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Handle the case when make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True, and it should pass the failing test.
