The problem lies in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statements that handle the `make_current` argument. 

The failing test `test_force_current` tries to initialize an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. After initializing, it checks if the current `IOLoop` is the same as the one just initialized and then tries to initialize another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If it is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method, but if it is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This behavior is inconsistent and leads to the issue reported in the GitHub post.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and handling the `make_current` argument is consistent and correct.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to simplify the logic by always calling the `make_current` method if `make_current` is `True`. If the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` and `make_current` is also `True`, then we'll raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will behave consistently and address the issue reported in the GitHub post. Now, it should also pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
