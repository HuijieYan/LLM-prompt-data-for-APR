Potential error location: The issue may be with the self.make_current() function call.

Bug's cause: The bug occurs because the make_current() method is not being called properly based on the input value of make_current.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the make_current() method exists in the class and call it appropriately based on the input value of make_current.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
