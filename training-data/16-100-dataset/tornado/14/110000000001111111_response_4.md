The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the case when make_current is True. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, make it the current instance. However, when make_current is True, it is supposed to raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location is in the condition `if make_current:`. This condition checks if make_current is True, but it does not check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making it the current instance or raising an error.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the case when make_current is True, resulting in unexpected behavior and the error message being raised when it should not be.

One approach to fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making it the current instance or raising an error when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when make_current is True and ensure that the appropriate actions are taken based on the existence of an IOLoop instance. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
