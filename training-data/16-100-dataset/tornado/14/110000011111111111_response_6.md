The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional check for `make_current` parameter and its validation. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which contradicts the condition that is supposed to prevent this scenario.

The cause of the bug is that the if-else conditions are not properly handling the case when `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to ensure that the validation of `make_current` parameter is done correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to change the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # remove the redundant check for make_current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check if IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when `make_current` is True properly, and the RuntimeError should not be raised when it shouldn't be.

This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
