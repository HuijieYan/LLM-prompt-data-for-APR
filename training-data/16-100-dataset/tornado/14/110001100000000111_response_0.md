Analyzing the provided code, the related functions, and the GitHub issue reveals the following:

1. The `initialize` function takes a parameter `make_current`, and based on its value, it either calls `make_current()` or raises a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition for checking if `make_current` is `None`. It checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. This is followed by an `elif` condition which seems redundant and confusing.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not properly implemented, and the conditions are unclear.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Remove the redundant `elif` condition and simplify the logic.
   - Check if `make_current` is `None` and then call `self.make_current()` if needed, without checking if the current IOLoop exists.
   - If `make_current` is not `None`, then simply check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise an error if it does.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the bug is fixed, and the function behavior aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
