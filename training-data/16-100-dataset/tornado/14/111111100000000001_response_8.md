1. The buggy function is `initialize` which is a method of the `IOLoop` class. The method checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and if not, it tries to make the current instance. The potential issue could be with the logic of checking and making the current instance.

2. The potential error location is in the conditional statements that check and make the current instance of `IOLoop`.

3. (a) The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and if not, it tries to make the current instance.
   (b) The `IOLoop` class has the methods `current` and `make_current` to get the current instance and make a new instance the current one.
   (c) The related functions `current` and `make_current` are called within the `initialize` method to check the current instance and make a new instance the current one.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the conditional statements to correctly check and make the current instance.
   - Ensure that the logic to check and make the current instance is implemented accurately.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=True):  # Fixed the default value and removed the None option
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the default value of `make_current` is set to `True` and the condition to check if the current instance exists is updated to check if it is not None. The logic for making the current instance is also updated to only make a new instance the current one if it doesn't already exist.
