The buggy function "initialize" is part of the "IOLoop" class, which also contains two other functions "current" and "make_current". The "current" and "make_current" functions are also defined outside the class, but are not related to the buggy function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and setting it as the current instance if it doesn't exist.

The bug's cause is that the condition `if make_current is None:` always results in the "if" block being executed, because the default value of `make_current` is None. This means that even if there is an existing IOLoop instance, the `make_current` method will not be called.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the current IOLoop instance needs to be adjusted so that it checks if there is no current instance and then sets the current instance accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if make_current is None:` has been kept as is, and the condition `if make_current:` has been updated to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` which makes sure that the current instance is set if it exists. Additionally, the `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` line has been updated to negate the condition, as it should only be raised if there is an existing current IOLoop.
