1. The buggy function is `initialize()` and it appears to be a method of a class, as it uses `self` as a parameter. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to initialize an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then expects to receive a RuntimeError when trying to initialize another IOLoop with `make_current=True` again.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize()` function seems to be the condition that checks if `make_current` is True and whether a current IOLoop instance already exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the `initialize()` function is not correctly checking for an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True. This is evident from the error message, which indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when trying to initialize a second IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding a check for an existing current IOLoop instance and modifying the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize()` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
