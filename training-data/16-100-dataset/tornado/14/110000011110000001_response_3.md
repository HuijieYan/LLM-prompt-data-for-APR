1. The buggy function is an `initialize` method that is part of a class, possibly related to IOLoop. It takes an argument `make_current` and checks if it is None or True, then executes certain code based on that condition. The test function `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and expects that to successfully create the object. However, it fails with a RuntimeError indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` inside the `elif make_current` block. This condition is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the code checks if the current IOLoop is None before making it current, but when `make_current` is True, it should directly make the current IOLoop without checking if it is None.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement inside the `elif make_current` block to directly call `self.make_current()` without checking if the current IOLoop is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly make the current IOLoop when `make_current` is True, regardless of whether it already exists. This should allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass.
