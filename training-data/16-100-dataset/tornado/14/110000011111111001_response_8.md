The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. It should ensure that if `make_current` is True, the current IOLoop does not already exist before trying to make it the current loop.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix this, we can modify the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is True and raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modified function, the test should pass without raising a RuntimeError when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.
