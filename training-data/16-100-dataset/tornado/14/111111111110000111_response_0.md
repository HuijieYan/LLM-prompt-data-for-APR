### Bug Analysis:

The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object by setting it as the current `IOLoop` if there is no current `IOLoop` already, and also has the functionality to force it to become the current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation is causing a `RuntimeError` when trying to make the current `IOLoop` without checking if one already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` instantiates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, and then attempts to do the same again, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as the current behavior of `initialize` is to immediately raise such an error without checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.

The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy between the behavior and the condition check on line 252. It indicates that even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it still raises a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists".

### Bug cause:
The potential location of the bug is in the `initialize` function on line 252, specifically in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. This condition should allow the `IOLoop` to be initialized as the current `IOLoop` only if there is no current `IOLoop`. However, even if there is no current `IOLoop`, the function still raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to properly check if a current `IOLoop` exists before attempting to make the current `IOLoop`.
2. Update the behavior of the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly.

### Corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make it the current `IOLoop`. This will fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
