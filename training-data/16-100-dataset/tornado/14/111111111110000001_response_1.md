1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The function takes a `make_current` argument and checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is already current. If `make_current` is not provided, it makes the current `IOLoop` instance, while if `make_current` is `True`, it also ensures that there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance before making the current instance. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and it is expecting to raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location is in the `initialize` method where the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists is not working as expected, as it is raising a `RuntimeError` even when a current `IOLoop` instance doesn't exist.

3. (a). The problematic function `initialize` is not handling the logic to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance properly.
   (b). The related `IOLoop` class contains the `initialize` method and the methods `current` and `make_current`.
   (c). The failing test `test_force_current` is expecting the `initialize` method to raise a `RuntimeError` in a specific scenario, which it currently does but incorrectly.
   (d). The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it shouldn't because the current test is trying to create a new current `IOLoop` instance.

4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the logic for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
With this correction, the `initialize` method will properly handle the scenarios for making the current `IOLoop` instance and raising a `RuntimeError` when needed. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
