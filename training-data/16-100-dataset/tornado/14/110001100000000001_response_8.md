1. The buggy function "initialize" is checking if the IOLoop is already made current using the "make_current" method. If it is not, it calls the "make_current" method to make it current. However, there are issues with how the "make_current" and "current" methods are being used within the "initialize" function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition where it checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None and calls self.make_current(). This condition does not handle the case when make_current is passed as an argument to the initialize function.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) In the buggy function, the condition for checking if IOLoop.current() is None and calling self.make_current() is incorrect. It does not handle the case when make_current is passed as an argument to the function.
   (b) The "make_current" and "current" methods are not being used correctly within the "initialize" function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Modify the condition to properly handle the case when make_current is passed as an argument to the function.
   (b) Use the "make_current" and "current" methods appropriately within the "initialize" function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected code, the condition checks if make_current is None or True, and if IOLoop.current() is None, it calls self.make_current(). It also handles the case when make_current is explicitly passed as False and raises a RuntimeError if IOLoop.current() is not None.
