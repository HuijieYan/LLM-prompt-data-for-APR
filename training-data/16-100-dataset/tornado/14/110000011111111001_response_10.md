The issue in the `initialize` function is that when `make_current` is True, it is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance, and if it doesn't exist, it is raising a `RuntimeError`. However, the intention seems to be that if `make_current` is True and the IOLoop instance doesn't exist, it should be created.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to create the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist when `make_current` is True. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will create the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist when `make_current` is True, and it will pass the failing test case.
