Analysis:
The buggy function is a part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and why the error "already exists" is being raised even though it seems that the current instance is None.

The potential error is present in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, but it does not handle the case when the current instance exists but is not None.

The bug's cause is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly evaluated. The code should check if the current instance is None, but it does not handle the scenario when the current instance is not None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition to handle both cases when the current instance is None and when it is not None.
2. Add a check to determine if the current instance exists and is not None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is assigned to `current_instance` before the conditions. Then, the conditions are modified to check if `current_instance` is None or not None, handling both cases correctly. This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function works as intended without raising any unnecessary errors.
