The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is None, and if it is, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it returns None, it then calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then either raises an error or calls `self.make_current()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. Depending on the value of `make_current`, the logic may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the logic to check for the existence of a current IOLoop or to create a new one based on the value of `make_current` is not properly implemented.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Refactoring the logic to properly handle the different cases based on the value of `make_current`.
2. Adding proper checks and conditionals to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented based on the value of `make_current`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    # added this condition to handle case when make_current is False
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
```

This corrected code handles the different cases based on the value of `make_current` and fixes the issue reported in the GitHub post.
