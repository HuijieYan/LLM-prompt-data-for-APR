Potential error location: In the initialize function of the IOLoop class, the condition `if make_current is None` is checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. However, when `make_current=True`, the condition `if make_current` is attempting to check the same thing again, which is redundant and causing the error.

Bug Cause:
a. The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance in multiple places, leading to redundant checks and an incorrect error being raised.
b. The class `IOLoop` is not handling the behavior of making the IOLoop current correctly in the `initialize` function.
c. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to verify the behavior of creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but it's currently failing due to the redundant checks in the initialize function.
d. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised because the current IOLoop already exists, even though it's not the case.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the redundant check for `make_current` and only consider the case when `make_current` is True to handle making the IOLoop current.
2. Update the `make_current` function to properly handle the logic for making the IOLoop current.

Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the redundant check for `make_current` is removed and the behavior of making the IOLoop current is handled appropriately. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
