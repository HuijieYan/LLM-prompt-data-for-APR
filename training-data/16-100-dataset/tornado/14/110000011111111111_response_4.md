The issue is that the `make_current` parameter is not being handled correctly in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True, the function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does, but if it doesn't exist, it should then call `self.make_current()`.

The problem is that the current function is being called with the `instance=False` parameter, which means it will always return None, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the IOLoop instance without using the `instance=False` parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test. This change also resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
