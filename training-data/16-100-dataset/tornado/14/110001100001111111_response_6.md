The issue in the buggy code is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect, leading to the "already exists" error being raised incorrectly.

In the buggy function, the `initialize` function is checking if the current IOLoop already exists, and if it does not, it is supposed to call the `make_current` function. The issue is with the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is used to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, but the condition is incorrect, leading to the "already exists" error being raised incorrectly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists and then call the `make_current` function accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # using self.current instead of IOLoop.current
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # checking if IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists using `self.current(instance=False)`, and calls `make_current` if it doesn't. It also correctly checks if the IOLoop instance already exists before raising the "already exists" error.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
