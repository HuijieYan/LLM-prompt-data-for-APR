The issue in the buggy function is that it is not calling the correct function to check for the current IOLoop instance. The function `IOLoop.current` is being called without the correct class reference. 

To fix this issue, the function `IOLoop.current` should be called with the class reference and the `make_current` function should be called using `self`. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks for the current IOLoop instance and calls the `make_current` function using `self`. This resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
