The problematic function `initialize` is expecting an argument `make_current` but it is also calling another function `make_current` from the same file, which can lead to confusion and errors. 

The failing test is calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)`, and the error message indicates that it is raising a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we can rename the argument `make_current` in the `initialize` function to something else that does not conflict with the function name `make_current`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, force_current=None):
    if force_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif force_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function argument `force_current` is less likely to be mistaken for the function name `make_current`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
