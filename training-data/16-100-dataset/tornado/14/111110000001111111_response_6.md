Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `if make_current:` block.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is True, the function checks if the current IOLoop does not exist, and if so, it raises a RuntimeError. However, the next line still attempts to make the current IOLoop, which is contradictory.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the redundant check for the current IOLoop in the `if make_current:` block.
2. If `make_current` is True, always attempt to make the current IOLoop without checking for its existence.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # Removed the redundant check for the current IOLoop
        self.make_current()  # Always attempt to make the current IOLoop
```

This corrected code ensures that when `make_current` is True, the IOLoop will always attempt to become the current IOLoop without checking its existence, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
