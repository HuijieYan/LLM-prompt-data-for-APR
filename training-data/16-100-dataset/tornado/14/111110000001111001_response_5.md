The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the `make_current` parameter. It should be checking if the provided `make_current` is `True` or `False` and then performing the appropriate action based on that.

Additionally, the function was also checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. This is incorrect as `IOLoop.current` does not take an `instance` parameter. Instead, it should simply be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` by calling `IOLoop.current()`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and also fix the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.
