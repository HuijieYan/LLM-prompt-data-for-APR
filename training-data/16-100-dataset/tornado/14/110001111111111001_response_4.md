The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly checking the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is passed as `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Changed this line to check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Reversed the condition to check if IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and should pass the failing test.

This corrected code checks if `make_current` is `True` before raising a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop already exists.

By using the updated `initialize` function, the failing test should now pass.
