1. The buggy function is a part of the `IOLoop` class. It is used to initialize the IOLoop and potentially make it the current IOLoop. The `initialize` function takes an argument `make_current` which, if True, makes the IOLoop the current IOLoop. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks if the current IOLoop exists and then decides whether to make the IOLoop the current one or not.

3. (a). The buggy function checks if the current IOLoop exists and if it does not, it attempts to make the IOLoop the current one. However, the condition for checking the current IOLoop is incorrect, and it may not behave as expected.

   (b). The relationship with the buggy class is that the IOLoop class has methods like `current` and `make_current` which are used within the `initialize` function.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the condition for checking the current IOLoop to ensure that it behaves as expected. We should also handle the case where `make_current` is False. 

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other parts of the class)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
            else:
                if IOLoop.current() is None:
                    self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the `instance=False` argument when calling `IOLoop.current()`, as it was causing the incorrect behavior. We have also added a condition for handling the case where `make_current` is False. This ensures that the IOLoop is made the current IOLoop only when necessary.
