The buggy function is the `initialize` method of a class (presumably `IOLoop`) which takes a parameter `make_current` with a default value of `None`. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current` set to `True` and then tries to create another instance with `make_current` also set to `True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`. 

The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is set to `True`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `elif make_current:` block, which is intended to check if the current IOLoop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `elif make_current:` block to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. We can modify the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:` to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and raise the error if it does.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
