The problem with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. Specifically, the condition `if make_current is None` should only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True. Additionally, when `make_current` is True, it should also raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current()` already exists.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, and then trying to create another IOLoop with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling this case, leading to the test failure.

The GitHub issue also highlights the discrepancy between the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the function `initialize` needs to be modified as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This change ensures that `self.make_current()` is only called when `make_current` is True and also raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current()` already exists when `make_current` is True.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
