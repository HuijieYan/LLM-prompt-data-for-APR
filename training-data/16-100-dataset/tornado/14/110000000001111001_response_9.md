The potential error location within the buggy function is in the if-else statement. When make_current is True, the function should check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is not None, it should raise a RuntimeError. However, the current implementation is not handling this case correctly.

The bug is caused by not properly handling the case when make_current is True.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the if-else statement to properly handle the case when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the case when make_current is True and check if the current IOLoop already exists before making it current.
