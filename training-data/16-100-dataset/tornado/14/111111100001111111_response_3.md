The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check whether there is a current `IOLoop` instance and optionally make the current instance during initialization. However, the logic for checking the current instance and making it the current instance is flawed.

The problem occurs when the `make_current` parameter is True. In this case, the function first checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. If this condition is met, the function raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists", which is logically contradictory.

To fix this bug, we need to reevaluate the logic of the `initialize` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then we check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current instance to determine whether to make the current instance or raise an error.

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
