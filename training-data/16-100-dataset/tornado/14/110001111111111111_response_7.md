## Analysis
The issue is occurring in the `initialize` function. The error message indicates that even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, a `RuntimeError` is still being raised for "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not working as expected.

The `initialize` function takes an argument `make_current`, which is supposed to be a boolean. Based on the failing test, when `make_current` is `True`, it is expected that a new IOLoop should be created and set as the current IOLoop, and if `make_current` is not provided or `None`, and there is no current IOLoop, then a new IOLoop should be created and set to the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, but a current IOLoop already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is nested within another condition, causing it to incorrectly check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

## Possible Approaches
1. Remove the nested condition and directly check for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current` is `None`.
2. Use the `make_current` argument directly to determine whether to create and set the current IOLoop or to raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
