1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. This function is called with the argument `make_current=True` in the failing test `test_force_current`. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is unexpected. The corresponding GitHub issue suggests that there might be a problem with how the `None` case is handled in this function.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `None`. It then checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and calls `self.make_current()` if it is. The else block then checks if `make_current` is True and whether `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

3. The bug is caused because the `if` condition in the `initialize` function does not handle the case when `make_current is True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` correctly. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` will become the current `IOLoop`, but the function is raising a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop`.

4. To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. Additionally, the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` needs to be updated.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
