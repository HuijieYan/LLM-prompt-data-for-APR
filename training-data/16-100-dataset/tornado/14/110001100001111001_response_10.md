The bug in the initialize function is that the if condition for checking if make_current is True is not being properly evaluated due to the way the condition is written. It should be checking if make_current is not None instead of checking if it is True.

In addition, the function calls IOLoop.current and self.make_current, but these functions are not defined in the current namespace and should be referenced with their full names including the module.

To fix the bug, the condition for make_current should be updated to check if it is not None, and the method calls need to reference the functions with their full names including the module.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            tornado.ioloop.make_current(self)
    elif make_current is not None:
        if tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        tornado.ioloop.make_current(self)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the make_current parameter and call the related functions from the correct module.
