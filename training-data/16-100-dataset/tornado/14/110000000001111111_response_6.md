1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance exists and, if not, makes it the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should always make the IOLoop the current one. If it is not set, it should only make the IOLoop current if it doesn't exist. The GitHub issue points out the confusion around when the "already exists" error is raised.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements for `make_current`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the different scenarios for creating and making the IOLoop current. It does not distinguish between the cases where `make_current` is `None` and `True`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check for `make_current` being `False` and not doing anything in that case.
   - Refactoring the conditional statements to clearly handle the different cases for `make_current`.
   - Properly raising the "already exists" error only when it is appropriate.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and only raises the "already exists" error if necessary. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
