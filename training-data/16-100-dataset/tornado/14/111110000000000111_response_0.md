Potential error location: 
The potential error in the buggy function is at the "initialize" function where it checks the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` before raising a RuntimeError.

Bug cause:
The bug causes is that the condition checks if the current IOLoop is None, and if it is None, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory because if it is None, it should not raise a RuntimeError.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the condition to correctly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance is None.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we have changed the condition in the elif statement to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None, and then raise a RuntimeError. This ensures that the code behaves as expected and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
