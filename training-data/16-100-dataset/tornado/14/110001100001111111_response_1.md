Upon analyzing the buggy function and its related functions, along with the input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. 

The issue is arising because the `make_current` parameter is not being used properly to determine whether to make the IOLoop current. Additionally, there is a mix-up between calling class methods and function calls in the code. 

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:

1. The `make_current` parameter should be used appropriately to either make the IOLoop current or raise an error if it already exists.
2. The correct function should be called to set the IOLoop current.
3. The conditionals should be modified to reflect the correct logic based on the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = current(instance=False)  # Call the current method from the related functions
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()  # Call the make_current method from the related functions
    else:
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()  # Call the make_current method from the related functions
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed and the function should behave as expected, satisfying the given input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
