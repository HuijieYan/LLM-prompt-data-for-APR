The potential error in the `initialize` function is in the condition `if make_current is None`. When the `make_current` parameter is passed as `True`, the condition will evaluate to `False` and the code inside the block will not run. This is likely causing the tests to fail when `make_current` is passed as `True`.

To fix this, we can change the condition in the `initialize` function to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and execute the appropriate code based on its value.
