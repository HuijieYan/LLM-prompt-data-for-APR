Potential error location: 

The issue seems to be in the conditional statement where it checks if the current IOLoop is None and then raises a RuntimeError if make_current is True.

Bug's cause:

The bug is caused by the conditional statement not correctly handling the logic to check for the existence of the current IOLoop.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the make_current parameter is True and the current IOLoop exists, then raise the RuntimeError.
2. Otherwise, make the current IOLoop if it does not exist.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected code implements the suggested fixes:
1. Check if make_current is True and the current IOLoop exists, then raise a RuntimeError.
2. Otherwise, make the current IOLoop if it does not exist.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and the function will work as expected.
