The issue with the buggy function is that the `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly. It is checking if `make_current` is None, and if it is, it attempts to make the current IOLoop. However, if `make_current` is True, it also checks if the current IOLoop exists, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected input/output variable information.
