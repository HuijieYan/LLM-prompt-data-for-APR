# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

The issue with the original code is that there was a logical error in the elif condition. It should be checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None before raising the RuntimeError. Additionally, the else statement has been added to explicitly call self.make_current() in the case that IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.
