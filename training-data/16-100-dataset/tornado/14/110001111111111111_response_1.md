The issue in the buggy code seems to be related to the `initialize` function's logic. The function is supposed to initialize an instance of IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if necessary. However, the logic for checking the current IOLoop and raising an error if it already exists seems to be flawed.

The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then verify that the current IOLoop is indeed the new one. However, the current logic in the `initialize` function is incorrectly handling the `make_current` parameter and the check for existing current IOLoop.

The failing test indicates that the error is triggered at the point where the new IOLoop is being initialized with `make_current=True`, leading to the RuntimeError being raised.

The GitHub issue also highlights a similar discrepancy, indicating that the logic for checking the current IOLoop and raising an error seems incorrect.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. The `make_current` parameter should be checked more effectively, and the condition for checking the existing current IOLoop also needs to be refined.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for existing current IOLoop. Additionally, a check should be added to ensure that if `make_current=True`, the new IOLoop indeed becomes the current one.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:  # This check can be simplified
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this adjustment, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for existing current IOLoop correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
