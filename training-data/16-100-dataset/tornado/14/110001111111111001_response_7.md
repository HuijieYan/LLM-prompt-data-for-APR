The issue lies in the `initialize` function where the condition `if make_current is None` is not handled correctly. Additionally, the `make_current` function is not being called properly.

The error message indicates that the "current IOLoop already exists" when trying to initialize the `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. This suggests that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not being evaluated correctly.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `make_current` function is called properly and the condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix involves correcting the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:` and also fixing the condition within the block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not.

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function should now handle the cases appropriately and pass the failing test.
