The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the if condition on line 32. When `make_current` is True, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. This is contradictory because if `make_current` is True, then the function should not raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set.

The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None is incorrect when `make_current` is True. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is not set.

To fix the bug, the condition on line 32 should be changed to:

```python
if make_current is not False and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This change ensures that the error is only raised when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is already set.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not False and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```
