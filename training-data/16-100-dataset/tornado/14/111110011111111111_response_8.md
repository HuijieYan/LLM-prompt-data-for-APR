The problem with the current implementation of the `initialize` function is that it checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists without considering the value of the `make_current` parameter. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current` is True.

The cause of the bug is a logical flaw in the conditional checks for `make_current` and the existing `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should simply make the current instance without checking for the existing instance when `make_current` is True. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing instance of `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function will pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
