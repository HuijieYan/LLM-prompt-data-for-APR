The buggy function is the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. It takes in a parameter `make_current` and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop.

The related functions are `current` and `make_current` which are called within the `initialize` function.

The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file creates an IOLoop instance with the `make_current` parameter set to True. It then checks if the current IOLoop instance matches the created instance. The test is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` if a second IOLoop with `make_current=True` is created.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised on line 664 of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file, because the current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the `elif` condition where it checks if `make_current` is True and then proceeds to see if the current IOLoop already exists.

One possible cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists and ensure that it correctly handles the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
