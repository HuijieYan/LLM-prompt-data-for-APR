The issue in the buggy function is that the logic for checking whether the current IOLoop exists or not is incorrect. The function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True or if the current IOLoop does not exist. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly.

The failing test `test_force_current` is designed to check if creating a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.

The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it is incorrectly detecting that the current IOLoop already exists when it should not.

The GitHub issue title accurately identifies the location of the bug as being around line 252 in `ioloop.py`. The issue description also questions why the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it seems that the current IOLoop does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated code checks if `make_current` is not None, and in that case, it checks if the current IOLoop exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. It also calls `self.make_current()` to set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop. Now, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
