The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is incorrectly checking if the current instance is None or not None when `make_current` is True. This is causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when it should not.

To fix this bug, we can update the `initialize` function to always call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is not None, regardless of the current state of the IOLoop.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This updated code will ensure that `self.make_current()` is always called if `make_current` is not None or is True, which fixes the bug.

With this change, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
