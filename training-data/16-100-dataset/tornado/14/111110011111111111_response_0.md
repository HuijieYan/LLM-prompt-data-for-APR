The issue in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It should first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and only then make the current instance. However, the current implementation raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True` without first checking if there is already a current instance.

The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set this instance as the current instance. However, the current implementation raises a `RuntimeError` because it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function will first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

This fix should make the failing test `test_force_current` pass, as it will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`, setting the current instance and not raising a `RuntimeError`.

The corrected code resolves the issue posted in the GitHub by ensuring that the function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current instance.

By making these changes, the bug will be fixed, and the failing tests will pass, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
