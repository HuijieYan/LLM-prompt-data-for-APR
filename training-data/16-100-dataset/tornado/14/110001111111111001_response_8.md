The issue in the buggy function `initialize` lies in the logic for checking and raising an error when `make_current` is True. The `make_current` variable should be used as a flag to indicate whether the IOLoop needs to be set as the current one, rather than being a method call. Additionally, the `make_current` parameter should default to False, and the `make_current` method should be called within the function instead of being passed as a parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the method will first check if `make_current` is True and if the current IOLoop exists, it will raise a RuntimeError. Then, it will proceed to make the IOLoop the current one.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
