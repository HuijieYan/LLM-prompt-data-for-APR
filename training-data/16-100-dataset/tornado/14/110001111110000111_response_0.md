The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it calls `make_current()`. If `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The issue seems to be related to the way the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is performed.

The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then checks if the current `IOLoop` is the newly created one, and also checks if trying to create another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`. The error message shows that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when the `make_current` is set to `True` even though the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

The GitHub issue title is not very descriptive, but the detailed description suggests that the issue is with the logic at line 252 in `ioloop.py`, where it is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if make_current` block, where it is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. 

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be corrected. The `if make_current` block should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Removed the redundant check for True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the code should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
