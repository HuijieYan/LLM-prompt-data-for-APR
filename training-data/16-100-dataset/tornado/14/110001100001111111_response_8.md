The bug is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `ioloop.py` file. The problem lies in the logic flow when checking if the IOLoop current instance exists or not. The function `IOLoop.current` is being called with the `instance` parameter set to `False` which is incorrect as it should be `True`.

The issue posted on GitHub accurately identifies the problem - the `IOLoop.current` function is being called with the incorrect parameter and is leading to an unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `IOLoop.current` function should be called with `instance=True`. Additionally, the logic flow to check if the IOLoop instance already exists should be adjusted to handle the conditions correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists and take the necessary actions based on the conditions. This code also addresses the issue identified in the GitHub post.
