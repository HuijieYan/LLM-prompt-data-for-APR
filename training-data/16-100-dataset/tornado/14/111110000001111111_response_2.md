The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition `if make_current:` which checks if `make_current` is True and then verifies if the `current` `IOLoop` instance exists. However, this logic is flawed because it should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current instance already exists, but it currently raises an error if `make_current` is False and no instance exists. This is not the expected behavior.

The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is True and an instance already exists, it should raise an error. If `make_current` is False and no instance exists, it should set the instance as current. If `make_current` is None, it should also set the instance as current if none exists.

To fix this, we need to adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to achieve the expected behavior based on the input value of `make_current`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This code now checks if `make_current` is None or True, and if so, it verifies if the current instance already exists and raises an error if it does. If `make_current` is False, it will not raise an error and proceed to set the instance as current. This updated logic aligns with the expected behavior.

The GitHub issue title could be revised to reflect the corrected logic:
```
ioloop.py need to check make_current before making current IOLoop
```
