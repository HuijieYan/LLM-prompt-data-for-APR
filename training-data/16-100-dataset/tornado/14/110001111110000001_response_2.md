1. The initialize function in ioloop.py is called with the argument make_current=True in the failing test case, and it should check if there is already an existing current IOLoop before creating a new one. The failing test is expecting a RuntimeError to be raised if a second IOLoop with make_current=True is created.

2. The potential error location within the initialize function is in the elif make_current block, where it checks if a current IOLoop already exists.

3. The bug is caused by the conditional check for an existing current IOLoop not working as intended. This check is not correctly preventing the creation of a new IOLoop when one already exists. This is evident from the failing test message, which indicates that a RuntimeError should be raised when a second IOLoop with make_current=True is created but it's not happening in the buggy code.

4. A possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the condition where a current IOLoop already exists. This can be achieved by checking if a current IOLoop exists before attempting to create a new one, and if it does, raise a RuntimeError as expected.

5. Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed elif make_current to else
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function will correctly handle the case where a current IOLoop already exists when make_current=True is passed, and it should pass the failing test.
