The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is attempting to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter and the logic for checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then asserting that it should be the current IOLoop. It also expects that trying to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The issue title and description in the GitHub issue also point to the same error, questioning why the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function seems to be in the logic for checking the current IOLoop's existence and handling the `make_current` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current IOLoop's existence.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current or make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
- We first check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and then we check if the current IOLoop already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`.
- After the check, if `make_current` is `True` or `None`, we call `self.make_current()` to make the current instance.
- This corrected code should now handle the initialization and current IOLoop checking properly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.

By implementing and testing this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
