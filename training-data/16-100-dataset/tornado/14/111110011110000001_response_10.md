1. The buggy function is `initialize` and it is part of the `IOLoop` class. The failing test is testing the behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`, and it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the conditional block where `make_current` is set to `True`.

3. The bug's cause is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, and a current `IOLoop` already exists, the conditional block in the `initialize` function is not raising the `RuntimeError` as expected. It should raise a `RuntimeError` when a current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. The failing test confirms that the `RuntimeError` is not being raised as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if a current `IOLoop` already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True`.
   b. Ensure that the `initialize` function handles the case when `make_current` is set to `True` correctly and raises a `RuntimeError` if needed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `RuntimeError` will be raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, passing the failing test.
