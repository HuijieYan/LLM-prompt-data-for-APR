1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance. The related functions `current` and `make_current` are used within the `initialize` function to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The failing test `test_force_current` instantiates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create a second `IOLoop` instance with the same argument, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional block where it checks if the `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is True.

3. The bug's cause is that the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is True after checking for the existence of the current instance. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even if no current instance exists.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Before calling `self.make_current()`, check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists again to handle the case where it was created between the initial check and the call to `self.make_current()`.
   - Remove the initial check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and always attempt to make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
