The problem lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the handling of the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code is supposed to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and if not, make the current instance. However, the current implementation unconditionally raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument, leading to an erroneous `RuntimeError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we should update the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `True`, it should first check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and if not, make the current instance. If an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
