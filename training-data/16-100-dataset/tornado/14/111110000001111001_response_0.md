The bug in the provided function `initialize` is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists, but instead, it is allowing the creation of a new current `IOLoop` even if one already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first store the current `IOLoop` instance in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we modified the conditions to check for `make_current` and `current_instance` accordingly. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.
