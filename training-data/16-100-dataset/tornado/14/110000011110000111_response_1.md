Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue lies within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is True, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists, but it is instead raising the error even if the `IOLoop` is None.

The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` method, the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists is not properly handled when `make_current` is True.

To fix this bug, the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is True should be modified to only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` exists. If it doesn't exist, then the `IOLoop` should be made current.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method now properly handles the case where `make_current` is True and rectifies the issue where the `RuntimeError` was raised even if the current `IOLoop` was None.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
