The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` function if the current IOLoop is not already instantiated. However, if `make_current` is not None, it checks if the current IOLoop is already instantiated and raises an error if it is not None, or calls `make_current` if it is None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` because it is being checked both inside the `if` and the `elif` blocks, leading to the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `if` and `elif` conditions are both checking the same condition, but the actions taken in each block are different.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary condition check in the `elif` block and only call `make_current` if `make_current` is True. Then, in the `else` block, raise an error if the current IOLoop is already instantiated.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code ensures that `make_current` is only called when it is set to True, and an error is raised if the current IOLoop is already instantiated when `make_current` is True. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
