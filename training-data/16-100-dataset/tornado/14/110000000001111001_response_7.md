The bug in the initialize function is that it is not properly checking for the current IOLoop instance when make_current is True. Additionally, the condition for make_current being None is also incorrect.

The buggy function is not correctly handling the make_current parameter and checking the current IOLoop instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check for the current IOLoop instance when make_current is True and handle the None case properly.
