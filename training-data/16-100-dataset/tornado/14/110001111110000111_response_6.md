The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object, and it takes an argument `make_current` which defaults to None. Based on the value of `make_current`, it either creates a new `IOLoop` instance or sets the current instance to the newly created instance.

The error in the function lies in the conditional check for `make_current`. When `make_current` is True, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which contradicts the condition.

The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then it tries to create another instance with the same flag set to True, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, due to the bug, the first instance creation also raises a `RuntimeError`, even though the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

The GitHub issue reflects the confusion around the occurrence of the `RuntimeError` when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check when `make_current` is True so that it only raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and create a new instance only if the current instance is None.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Adjusted the conditional check
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub by addressing the incorrect conditional check for `make_current`.
