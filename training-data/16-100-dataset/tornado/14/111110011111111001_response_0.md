The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to make the current `IOLoop` instance, unless it already exists. However, it is not handling the case where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` correctly. 

The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to become the current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` function is not handling this case as desired, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_loop and current_loop is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional statement for `make_current`, we ensure that if `make_current` is set to `True`, we check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if it exists. Otherwise, we make the current `IOLoop` instance.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and handle the input parameters as expected.
