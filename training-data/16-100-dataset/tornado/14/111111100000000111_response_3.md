The buggy function is `initialize` within the class `IOLoop` in the file `ioloop.py`. The function takes a parameter `make_current`, and it checks if `make_current` is `None`, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then makes the current `IOLoop` using `self.make_current()`. 

The potential error location is in the conditional statements where it checks the conditions for `make_current`. The issue could be with the logic when handling the `make_current` parameter.

The bug's cause:
(a). The `initialize` function does not handle the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly.
(b). The `IOLoop.make_current` function is not being utilized correctly.
(c). The `IOLoop.current` function is not being used appropriately to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.
(d). The GitHub issue reports a discrepancy in the logic, pointing out that `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, contradicts the subsequent raise of "already exists".

To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
1. Correcting the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.
2. Ensuring that the `IOLoop.current` and `IOLoop.make_current` functions are used appropriately to check for and set the current `IOLoop`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected code addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by fixing the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter and ensuring that the `IOLoop.current` and `IOLoop.make_current` functions are used appropriately.
