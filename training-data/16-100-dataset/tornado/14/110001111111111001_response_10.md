The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly checking if an IOLoop object already exists when `make_current` is set to True.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, and then it expects that a second attempt to create an IOLoop should raise a `RuntimeError` because the IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True. We should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
