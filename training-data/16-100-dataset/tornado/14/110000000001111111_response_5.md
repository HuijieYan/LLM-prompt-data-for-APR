The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop by setting the current instance. However, it contains a logical error which causes it to incorrectly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and make it current. The GitHub issue titled "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" is questioning why the `initialize` function raises "already exists" when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

Upon analyzing the code and the GitHub issue, it's evident that the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function. The function erroneously raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, even if `make_current` is set to `True`.

The bug's cause is the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is True, the function should make the IOLoop current regardless of its existence or non-existence.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function so that it correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and only raises an error if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and only raise an error when necessary, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.
