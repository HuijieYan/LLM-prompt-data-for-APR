The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it raises an error if `make_current` is `True`. However, in this case, it should actually call `self.make_current()` to create a new IOLoop.

To fix this issue, the `initialize` function should be modified to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, it creates a new IOLoop if one does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this modification, the function will properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and ensure that a new IOLoop is created if one does not already exist. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the function behaves as expected in all cases.
