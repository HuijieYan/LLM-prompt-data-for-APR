The issue in the code is that the `make_current` parameter is being ignored when the `initialize` method is called, and this is leading to the RuntimeError in the failing test.

To fix this, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Changes made:
1. Replaced the usage of `IOLoop.current` with `self.current` to correctly call the function from the instance.
2. In the `elif make_current` block, reversed the condition for checking if a current IOLoop exists so that we raise an error if it does exist.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
