The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check whether there is a current `IOLoop` instance and make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`. However, there seem to be discrepancies in the logic of the function. 

The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" suggests that there is an issue with the check for the current `IOLoop` instance and the handling of the `make_current` argument.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function `initialize` will now properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and it will also resolve the issue depicted in the GitHub post.
