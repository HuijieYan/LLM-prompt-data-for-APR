The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `initialize` method, particularly in the conditional checks for `make_current`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional checks and usage of the `make_current` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional checks and the usage of the `make_current` method to ensure that it is called correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the conditional checks to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. We also ensure that the `make_current` method is called only when necessary, based on the input parameter `make_current`.
