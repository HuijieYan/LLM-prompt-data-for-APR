The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert is incorrect. It is difficult to directly pinpoint the exact issue due to the complexity of the function and the related classes and functions. However, based on the input values and the expected values, it seems that the logic within the function is not properly handling the cases for calculating the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to carefully revise the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the input line and previous line information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.depth <= 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    
    if (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected code, the logic for handling indentation depth, previous definitions, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been revised based on the expected input/output variable information provided for the test cases. This should ensure that the function now behaves as expected and passes the provided test cases.
