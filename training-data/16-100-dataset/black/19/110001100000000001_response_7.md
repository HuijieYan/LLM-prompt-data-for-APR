Potential error location: There are multiple potential error locations within the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`. Some of the potential errors include incorrect handling of empty lines before certain types of code blocks, incorrect handling of indentation depth, and incorrect conditions for inserting empty lines.

Bug's cause: The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for determining when to insert empty lines before certain code blocks. This may be due to incorrect conditions and logic flow within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before different types of code blocks.
2. Ensure that the function takes into account all relevant conditions for inserting empty lines based on the previous line and the current line.
3. Check for any potential off-by-one errors in the logic for handling indentation depth and empty lines.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

class SomeClass:
    # other class methods...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the logic to handle the insertion of empty lines before different types of code blocks, and ensure that all relevant conditions are taken into account. We also fixed the conditions for handling the previous line and the current line to correctly determine when to insert empty lines.
