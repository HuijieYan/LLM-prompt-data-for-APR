The problem with the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be that it is not correctly handling the logic for appending newlines before and after certain types of code. This is leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual output values for the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the logic for appending newlines is correctly implemented for each specific code type that it encounters. It seems that the logic related to the presence of decorators, classes, and flow control statements may not be correctly implemented, leading to incorrect newline handling.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Review the logic for appending newlines before and after different code types (decorators, classes, flow control, etc.) and ensure it aligns with the expected behavior based on the failing test cases.
2. Check the conditions for appending newlines in the function and verify that they are correctly handling all relevant cases.
3. Verify that the `previous_line` and `current_line` variables are being used correctly to determine the appropriate newline behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
