To fix the buggy function, we will identify the issues in the current implementation and revise it accordingly to match the expected behavior for all the given test cases.

Looking at the expected values and types of variables for each test case, it seems the implementation needs to consider the "newlines" and "before" calculations, and the addition of 1 empty line in some conditions. Also, the implementation should properly manipulate the "previous_defs" list as per the expected results for Case 7.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple, List

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    type: str
    value: str
    prefix: str

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List[Leaf]
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected implementation, a new class definition is provided for Leaf and Line since these were referenced in the original function. The implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now modifies the variables as per the expected results for each test case, including manipulation of the `previous_defs` list when necessary. The implementation now accounts for the relationships between depth, decorators, imports, and yields to properly calculate the number of empty lines before and after each line.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and produce the expected results for all the given test cases.
