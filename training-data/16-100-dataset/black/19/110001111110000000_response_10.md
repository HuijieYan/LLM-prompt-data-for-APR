The buggy function attempts to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line in the code. It checks various conditions related to the current and previous lines to make this determination. However, it seems to have a bug in handling the empty line count.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, prefix, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_yield):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.prefix = prefix
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, prefix):
        self.prefix = prefix

class Self:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = Line(0, [], '', False, False, False, False, False)

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
    	self.previous_defs.pop()
    	before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've added some dummy classes to define the required `Leaf`, `Self`, and `Line` classes used in the function. I've also added `self` as an argument to the function's calls to `is_import` and `is_yield`, as those functions are defined to take `self` as an argument.

Please note that the actual implementations of the methods `is_import`, `is_class`, `is_def`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield` are assumed to be correct based on the available information. If there are issues with these methods, they would need to be addressed as well.
