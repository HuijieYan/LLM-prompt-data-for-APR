1. The buggy function appears to be a code formatter for Python. It is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The function considers various conditions such as depth of indentation, presence of leaves, decorators, flow control, import statements, and yield statements to compute the number of empty lines.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic for computing the number of empty lines based on the conditions specified.

3. The bug's cause is that the function may not be correctly computing the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the specified conditions. This could lead to incorrect formatting of the code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Reviewing the logic for computing the number of empty lines based on different conditions.
   b. Checking the handling of different types of lines such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure the correct number of empty lines are being calculated.
   c. Debugging the function by testing it with various code snippets to identify the specific conditions where it fails to compute the correct number of empty lines.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code:
- Added a check for the previous line being a decorator to prevent inserting empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
- Combined the conditional check for the previous line being None or a decorator to return 0, 0 in both cases.
- Modified the last two return statements to correctly handle the conditions for import and yield statements.
