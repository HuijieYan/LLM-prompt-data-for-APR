The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it checks for conditions related to previous lines. Specifically, the conditions checking for previous line attributes like is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, and is_yield may have some issues.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in handling the previous line attributes and checking for specific conditions related to those attributes. It seems that the function is not properly handling the different cases and conditions for calculating the number of empty lines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and revise the logic for handling previous line attributes and conditions related to is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, and is_yield.
2. Ensure that the function correctly checks the previous line and applies the appropriate rules for calculating the number of empty lines.

Corrected code:

```python
# Assuming the usage of the Leaf and Line classes, and importing the Tuple from the typing module

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
            and not current_line.is_import(self)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth

            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line

            and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the function calls the is_import and is_yield functions with the self parameter to properly check for the attributes of the previous line. This should help in addressing the bug and improve the functionality of the _maybe_empty_lines function.
