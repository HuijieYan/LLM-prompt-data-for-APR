The problematic function is a function that is used to determine the number of empty lines that need to be inserted before the current line. The function has multiple conditions that check the type of the current line and sets the number of empty lines accordingly.

The failing test is testing a case where a comment is present within a decorator in the source code. The error message shows that the expected output does not match the actual output.

Upon analyzing the code and the failing test, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of comments within decorators, which is affecting the number of empty lines inserted.

The potential error location within the function could be the handling of decorators and their checks. It seems like the condition for decorators and their relationship with comments and empty lines may not be handled correctly.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to review the conditions for decorators, comments, and empty lines and ensure that the handling of these cases is accurate.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the condition for handling decorators has been updated to ensure that empty lines are not inserted before the first line in the file or between decorators. Additionally, the condition for checking the previous line has been updated to include the case when the previous line is a decorator. These changes should address the issue observed in the failing test.
