Based on the information provided, the issue seems to arise from the incorrect handling of `newlines` and the conditions that follow regarding various properties of `current_line`. The `newlines` variable should be determined based on a few conditions and then used to calculate the return values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where `newlines` is being calculated and returned based on various conditions regarding the properties of `current_line`.

The bug's cause is the incorrect calculation and usage of the `newlines` variable. This is leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual output variable values.

To fix the bug, it's important to review the conditions used to calculate the `newlines` variable and ensure they are appropriately capturing the logic for determining the number of newlines. Based on the expected input/output variable information, it seems that the `newlines` variable should be calculated based on different conditions and used to return the expected values.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
