The issue in the provided function is caused by not updating the `previous_line` attribute after executing the logic to remove empty lines. This leads to incorrect behavior when processing subsequent lines, resulting in the failing test case.

To fix the issue, I would update the `previous_line` attribute after processing the `current_line` in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            self.previous_line = current_line
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            self.previous_line = current_line
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, 0
```

With this fix, the function now updates the `previous_line` attribute correctly, ensuring that subsequent lines are processed as expected. This should address the failing test case and ensure the correct behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
