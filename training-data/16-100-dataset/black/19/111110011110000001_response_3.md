Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` doesn't seem to have any syntax errors. The issue seems to be related to the functionality of the function itself. 

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is asserting the equality of `expected` and `actual` values using the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error message indicates that the expected and actual values are not equal.

It seems that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This could be causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual values.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the `_maybe_empty_lines` function calculates and handles the empty lines before and after the currently processed line. It seems to be incorrectly adding or removing empty lines, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly handles the calculation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. Check if the conditions for adding or removing empty lines are accurate and account for all possible scenarios.
3. Verify that the function is correctly interpreting the input `current_line` and making adjustments to empty lines accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure that it follows the expected behavior. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
