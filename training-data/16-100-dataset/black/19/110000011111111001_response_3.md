The buggy function appears to be intended to handle indentation and empty lines in code. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed in the code. The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected and actual output do not match, specifically in terms of the number of empty lines and comments.

The potential error location appears to be in the conditional statements inside the function, where the number of newlines and other details are being calculated based on the properties of the current line.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for handling empty lines and comments, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual output. This may be due to the incorrect assignment of the variable "newlines" based on certain conditions.

To fix the bug, the conditions for determining the number of newlines and handling comments need to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the logic for handling empty lines in different contexts (decorators, flow control, imports, etc.) needs to be revisited to ensure it accurately reflects the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues in the original function and pass the failing test case. It ensures that the correct number of newlines and comments are handled based on the current line's properties.
