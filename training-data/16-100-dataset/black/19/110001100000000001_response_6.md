Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function could be in the logic determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. There are multiple conditional statements and comparisons that could be causing the issue.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The function makes comparisons with the previous line and checks for various conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. Any incorrect logic in these comparisons could result in the wrong number of empty lines being inserted.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional statements and comparisons to ensure they are providing the correct logic for determining the number of empty lines.
2. Check for any potential conflicts or overlapping conditions that may be causing unexpected behavior.
3. Test the function with different types of input to identify any specific scenarios where the bug occurs.

Corrected code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

# this is the corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
