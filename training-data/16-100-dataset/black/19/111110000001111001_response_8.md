The issue with the buggy function is that it has multiple return statements and conditions, leading to potential conflicts and incorrect return values. The logic appears to be convoluted and possibly incorrect, especially with the use of multiple `return` statements that seem to override each other.

To fix the bug, the logic of the function needs to be restructured. It should handle the different conditions and return the appropriate values based on those conditions. The function needs to be made clearer and more concise.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass
from collections import deque

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        elif current_line.is_def:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            return 1, 0
        elif current_line.is_class:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            return 1, 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1
        elif current_line.is_import:
            return 1, 0
        elif current_line.is_yield or (self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0
```

This corrected code addresses the issues in the original function by restructuring the logic and utilizing a single return statement for each condition. This should prevent conflicts and ensure that the correct values are returned based on the input parameters.
