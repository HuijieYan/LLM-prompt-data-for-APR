The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the calculation of the number of newlines to be inserted in certain conditions.

The failing test is showing that there are discrepancies in the expected and actual output, particularly with the number of newlines and the presence of comments.

It seems that the function is not appropriately handling the insertion of newlines and comments in some specific cases, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the insertion of newlines before and after certain types of lines, as well as the preservation of comments.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to review the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted and ensure that comments are properly accounted for. Additionally, the function should consider the specific conditions related to decorators, class definitions, import statements, and flow control statements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that it passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
