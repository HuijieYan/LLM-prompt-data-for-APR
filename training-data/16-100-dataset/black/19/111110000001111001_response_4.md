The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be that the `newlines` variable is not calculated properly. The logic for setting the `newlines` variable is confusing and needs to be simplified. It also seems that the `before` variable is not being set correctly and is not being updated in all branches of the function.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for setting the `newlines` variable, and ensure that the `before` variable is updated in all necessary branches.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line = None
    previous_after = 0
    previous_defs = []

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and 
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

These changes should ensure that the `newlines` variable is calculated correctly and that the `before` variable is updated as expected in all branches of the function.
