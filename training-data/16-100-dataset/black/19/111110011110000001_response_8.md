The problematic function is `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing because it is expecting a certain output for a given input, but the actual output is different.

The bug likely lies in the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, where the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is not being handled correctly. This is resulting in an incorrect output that does not match the expected output in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is handled accurately for all possible cases. Debugging the function logic and refining the conditional statements within the function can help in identifying and fixing the bug.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

By correcting the conditional statements and the logic within the function, it should now produce the expected output for the test cases and resolve the failing test.
