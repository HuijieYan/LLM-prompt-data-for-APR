The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the inconsistent handling of the `self.previous_defs` list. In Case 7, the value of `self.previous_defs` is expected to be `[0]`, but the actual value is `[]`. This inconsistency is due to a conditional assignment within the while loop that modifies the value of `before` without considering the value of `depth`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for updating `self.previous_defs` and ensure that it behaves as expected in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if not depth:
        for i in range(len(self.previous_defs) - 1, -1, -1):
            if self.previous_defs[i] < depth:
                break
            self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated code should address the issues with the previous implementation and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
