Looking at the error message, it seems that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs. The error message indicates that the actual output has extra empty lines that are not present in the expected output.

Based on this, it's likely that the issue lies within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, since it is responsible for handling potential extra empty lines.

One possible approach to fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is to review the logic for handling empty lines. It seems that the function may be incorrectly adding extra empty lines in certain cases, leading to the mismatch in the test output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 1
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines = 0
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
            and not current_line.is_import(self)
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
            and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0

        return 0, 0
```

In the corrected function, we've adjusted the logic for handling decorators, empty lines, flow control, imports, and yields. We've also updated the calls to `is_import` and `is_yield` to be called with `self` as an argument, as these functions are methods of the same class.

This corrected version should address the issue and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test.
