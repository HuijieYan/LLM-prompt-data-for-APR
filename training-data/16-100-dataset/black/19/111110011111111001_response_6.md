The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it is not handling the input correctly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

The function _maybe_empty_lines seems to be designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It appears that the conditions and logic within the function are not accurately addressing all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test "test_comment_in_decorator" highlights the issue where the expected output does not match the actual output, indicating a discrepancy in handling comments and decorators.

To fix this issue, the _maybe_empty_lines function should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately addresses all the conditions specified for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

A potential approach for fixing the bug could involve restructuring the logic within the _maybe_empty_lines function to handle different cases such as comments within decorators, special cases within code blocks, and other scenarios that may affect the number of empty lines.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        after = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                after = 0
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                after = 0
            else:
                after = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            before = 0
            after = 1
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
            after = 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = 1
            after = 0
        else:
            # default case
            before = 0
            after = 0
        
        return before, after
```

This corrected code implements a revised logic for the _maybe_empty_lines function based on the identified issues and test cases. It should now accurately handle the different scenarios and hopefully address the discrepancies observed in the failing test.
