The problematic function appears to be a method called `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Based on the provided information, the function is supposed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there seem to be issues with the logic and conditions used within the function.

The function expects the current line object, the depth of the current line, and the state of some flags (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield`) as input parameters. It then performs several conditional checks based on these inputs to determine the number of empty lines to be added.

Based on the provided expected values and types of variables, along with the discrepancies in the actual input/output variable information, it seems that the conditional logic within the function is not correctly handling different scenarios, causing incorrect output.

To address this issue and correct the bug, it is necessary to review and revise the conditional statements within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that they accurately capture the intended logic for determining the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements should be revised to accurately capture the intended logic for determining the number of empty lines. This might involve adjusting the conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` flags, as well as the handling of `before` and `max_allowed` variables.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    # Default case
    before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n") if current_line.leaves else 0
    before = min(before, max_allowed)
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditional statements have been revised to ensure that the logic accurately captures the intended behavior of the function, as indicated by the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, the handling of `before` and `max_allowed` variables has been adjusted to align with the expected values.
