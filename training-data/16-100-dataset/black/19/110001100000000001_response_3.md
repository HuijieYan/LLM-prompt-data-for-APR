The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle indentation and empty lines in a piece of code. It uses information from other related functions like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_yield`, and `is_import`.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

The bug's cause may be due to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. This is also evident from the use of variables like `newlines`, `before`, and the conditional checks on `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, and `current_line.is_yield`. The function also uses `max_allowed`, `depth`, `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, and `self.previous_defs`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking and adjusting the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
2. Refactoring the logic for handling indentation and empty lines to make it more robust and accurate.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Assuming Leaf and Line classes are defined elsewhere

class CorrectedClass:
    # This is the corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        previous_defs = self.get_previous_defs()
        previous_line = self.get_previous_line()
        
        while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                previous_defs.append(depth)
            if previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if previous_line and previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            previous_line
            and previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            previous_line
            and previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, the related functions have been integrated into a class `CorrectedClass` and used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function has been modified to handle indentation and empty lines more accurately by improving the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Additionally, the use of variables like `max_allowed`, `depth`, `previous_defs`, and `previous_line` has been improved for better readability and maintainability.
