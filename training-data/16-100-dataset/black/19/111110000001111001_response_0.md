The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic is not handling all the conditions correctly, leading to incorrect return values. The conditions for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line are not properly handled, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle all the conditions and calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the input parameters and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

With the above corrected function, we have addressed the issues in handling the conditions and calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the input parameters and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
