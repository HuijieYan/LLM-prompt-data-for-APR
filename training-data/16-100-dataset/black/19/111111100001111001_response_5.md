The bug originates in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The problem lies in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be added before and after the currently processed line. The function appears to have issues with the calculation of `max_allowed` and handling the `newlines` variable.

The function is expected to return the `max_allowed` value and other related variables based on the conditions provided in the expected outputs. However, the function currently does not meet those expectations, which indicates that the logic and conditions inside the function need to be revised.

To fix this bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be updated to adjust the calculation of `max_allowed` and the handling of the `newlines` variable to align with the expected values. Additionally, the function should also ensure that the previous state is being correctly captured and handled as defined in the expected outputs.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if not self.previous_defs:
        self.previous_defs = [depth]
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function takes into account the conditions provided in the expected outputs. It adjusts the calculation of `max_allowed` and ensures that the previous state is handled correctly. This should address the issues and align the function with the expected behavior.
