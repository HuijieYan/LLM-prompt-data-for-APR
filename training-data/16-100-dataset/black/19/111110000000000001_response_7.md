The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is near the end, where it checks for specific cases like flow control, imports, and yield. It seems like the logic is not properly handling these cases, leading to incorrect empty line calculations.

The buggy function relies on the state of the class `EmptyLineTracker`, which maintains information about previous lines and their attributes. The function checks for various conditions such as depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yield, and based on these conditions, it determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the conditions and their interactions with the state of the class, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and the interaction with the state of the class within the function need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines based on the specified cases.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_defs = []
    previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected code includes the necessary attributes and state management within the `EmptyLineTracker` class and fixes the potential issues within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
