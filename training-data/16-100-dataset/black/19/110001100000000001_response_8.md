1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be designed to check and handle empty lines in the code. It uses various conditions and checks related to the properties and attributes of the `current_line` object. It also makes use of related functions like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the behavior of the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that processes the previous_line and current_line attributes and their respective properties, as well as in the conditions that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.

3. The bug's cause could be that the conditions and checks in the function might not be properly handling the cases where the previous_line and the current_line have certain properties (such as is_import or is_yield) and depth, leading to incorrect handling of empty lines.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic that processes the previous_line and current_line attributes to ensure that the conditions accurately handle the cases where certain properties are present.
   - Incorporate additional checks or conditions to cover all possible scenarios for inserting empty lines.
   - Ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted is accurate and handles all edge cases.

5. Corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Leaf:
    pass

class Line:
    pass

class CorrectedClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(self)  # Call the correct related function
            and not current_line.is_import(self)  # Call the correct related function
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)  # Call the correct related function
            and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)  # Call the correct related function
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_import` and `is_yield` related functions are called with the `self` parameter to ensure that they are properly accessed within the class context.
- The condition for handling empty lines between decorators is corrected to accurately check the `is_decorator` property.
- The class context is properly utilized throughout the function.
