The issue with the provided function is that the conditions used to determine the number of newlines and the values assigned to `before` and `newlines` are not consistent with the expected behavior based on the input parameters. The `before` and `newlines` values should be set according to specific conditions based on the input parameters to produce the expected result.

To fix the buggy function, the conditions for setting the values of `before` and `newlines` need to be revised based on the input parameters provided to the function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line and not current_line.leaves:
            newlines = 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 0
        before = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = 1

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected function ensures that `before` and `newlines` are set correctly based on the input parameters and the specific conditions that need to be met. This should address the failing test and produce the expected results.
