The issue with the current implementation is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` appears to be overly complex and difficult to understand due to its extensive list of conditional statements.

Here's how you can fix the buggy function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    comments: list
    bracket_tracker: str
    inside_brackets: bool
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    prefix: str

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            return max(0, max_allowed - before), 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In this modified version of the function, I simplified the conditionals to make the logic clearer and easier to understand. This should resolve the issues and make the function more maintainable and easier to test.
