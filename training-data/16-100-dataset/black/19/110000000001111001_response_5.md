The bug appears to be in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions provided. The function should be returning a tuple of two integers, but the values returned do not appear to align with the expected values.

The bug seems to be caused by an incorrect handling of the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert. In each case presented, the function doesn't always return the expected values according to the input parameters.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revisiting the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted and also checking the logic within the if-else statements to ensure that the correct values are being computed.

Below is a corrected version of the function based on the provided input/output variable information:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if line.leaves:
        first_leaf = line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or line.is_def or line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
