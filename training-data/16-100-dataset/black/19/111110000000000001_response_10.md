Potential Error Location: The while loop that updates the "before" variable based on the depth of the current line might be causing the bug. It seems to be overwriting the "before" variable under certain conditions, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Cause of the Bug:
The while loop is intended to update the "before" variable based on certain conditions, but it is also updating the "before" variable for all cases, even when it should not be updated. This is causing incorrect values to be assigned to the "before" variable, leading to incorrect empty line calculations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add additional conditions in the while loop to ensure that the "before" variable is only updated when certain conditions are met.
2. Separate the logic for updating the "before" variable into different conditional blocks based on the requirements for each case.
3. Refactor the code to make the logic for updating the "before" variable more explicit and easier to follow.

Corrected Code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():

    # Corrected function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
        depth = current_line.depth
        if depth > 0:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
                before = 1
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if (is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class) and self.previous_line:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditional logic for updating the "before" variable has been adjusted to make sure it is updated correctly for each specific case. This should address the bug and ensure that the function provides the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
