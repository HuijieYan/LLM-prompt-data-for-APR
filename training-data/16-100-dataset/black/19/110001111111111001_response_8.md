The issue seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of newlines and before values in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is not implementing the correct logic to determine the number of newlines to insert or the before parameter in certain conditions.

It appears that the conditions for determining newlines and before are not being handled correctly, resulting in mismatches between the expected and actual output.

To fix this issue, the logic for determining the newlines and before values in different conditions should be carefully reviewed and corrected. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields should be checked to ensure that the correct values are being calculated.

In addition, the logic for handling the previous_defs list should be reviewed to ensure that it is being updated and used correctly within the function.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = max_allowed
        newlines = 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        before = max(before, 1)
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        before = max(before, 1)

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected code should address the issues with incorrect newline and before calculations, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
