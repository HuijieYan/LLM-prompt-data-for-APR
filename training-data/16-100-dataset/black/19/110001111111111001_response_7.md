The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines, particularly when determining the number of newlines to return.

The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, which suggests that the function is not handling empty lines and comments correctly.

It seems that the function is not correctly considering empty lines and comments before returning the output.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling empty lines and comments, ensuring that they are correctly taken into account when determining the number of newlines to return.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
    if first_leaf:
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count('\n'), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ''

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should address the issues identified in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
