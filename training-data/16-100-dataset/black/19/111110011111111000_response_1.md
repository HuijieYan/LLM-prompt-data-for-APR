The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely caused by the incorrect logic in the conditions and variable assignments within the function. There are multiple checks and conditions that need to be corrected for the expected output. Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided failing test cases and expected results:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    pass

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: list


def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        before = 0
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or (self.previous_line.is_def and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth)):
            before = 0
        else:
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return before, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(1, max_allowed), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(1, max_allowed), 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues observed in the failing tests, and the expected results should match the actual results with these changes.
