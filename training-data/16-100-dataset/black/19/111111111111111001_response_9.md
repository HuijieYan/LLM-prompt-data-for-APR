The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is called with the input parameter `current_line` of type `Line` and the properties `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` of type `bool`. The function uses these properties to perform various checks and then return the values of variables `max_allowed`, `first_leaf`, `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator`.

The error seems to be related to incorrect handling of newlines in the `current_line` variable and its properties. This is causing the `actual` and `expected` values in the failing test to differ.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to correctly handle the newlines in the `current_line` variable and its properties, and return the expected values for the variables.

One approach to fixing the bug is to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` variable. This might involve updating the logic for calculating the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables, as well as ensuring that the proper number of newlines are added where necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should ensure that the function handles newlines and properties of the `current_line` variable correctly, and as a result, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
