The problem seems to be in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The error message from the failing test shows that there is an issue with how the empty lines are being handled in the resulting code.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be the logic for inserting empty lines, specifically the conditions for `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` and the subsequent logic.

The cause of the bug could arise from incorrect handling of empty lines, especially in cases related to decorators, `is_def`, and `is_class`.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could be to review the logic for inserting empty lines, especially around decorators, `is_def`, and `is_class`, and maybe refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the updated code, we have made changes to the conditions and added additional checks to handle `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` correctly, in order to address the issues observed in the failing test.
