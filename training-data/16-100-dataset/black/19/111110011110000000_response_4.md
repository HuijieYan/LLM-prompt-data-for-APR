The issue with the buggy function is that it is not returning the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. To fix this, the function needs to be modified to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the given conditions. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        # ... (other code)

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

With these modifications, the function should now return the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. This should address the failing test and the AssertionError related to the number of empty lines in the output.
