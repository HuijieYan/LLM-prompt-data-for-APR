1. It appears that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not handling the logic of empty lines and the different conditions appropriately, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the logic that handles the computation of empty lines based on different conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, depth, and previous line properties.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of different conditions and variables within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This is leading to incorrect calculations and returning unexpected results. The failing test and error message also indicate that the expected output is not matching the actual output, highlighting discrepancies in the function's behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the conditions and calculations for empty lines are accurately implemented.
   - Checking each conditional statement and its corresponding logic to identify any discrepancies or incorrect handling of cases.
   - Considering edge cases and different scenarios that could affect the computation of empty lines and adjusting the function's logic accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues and discrepancies in the previous implementation, ensuring that the function accurately computes the number of empty lines based on the specified conditions and input parameters. It should also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
