The potential error in the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it doesn't seem to be manipulating the class attributes properly. The function is assuming the existence of certain class attributes (`current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`), which are not explicitly defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It appears that these attributes are expected to be present due to the dependencies on other functions mentioned in the comments. So, the potential error lies in the missing class attributes and their manipulation within the function.

One approach to fixing the bug is to make sure that the required class attributes are properly defined and initialized within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. In addition, the function should be refactored to use these attributes in a way that aligns with their expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    prefix: str
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_defs: list
    previous_line: Line

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected code:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class now explicitly defines the required class attributes, such as `previous_defs` and `previous_line`.
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function now uses these class attributes properly for the intended logic.
