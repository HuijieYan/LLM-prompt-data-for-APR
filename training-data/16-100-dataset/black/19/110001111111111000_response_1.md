The issue with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be that it's not correctly handling the cases where specific conditions are met. The function's purpose is to determine whether empty lines should be inserted based on certain conditions related to the input `current_line` and the previous line.

The fix will be to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the expected cases, thus ensuring that the function behaves as intended.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Logic for previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    newlines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
            
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the different cases appropriately and produce the expected outputs for each scenario. After updating the function with the corrected logic, re-running the failing test should result in a passing outcome.
