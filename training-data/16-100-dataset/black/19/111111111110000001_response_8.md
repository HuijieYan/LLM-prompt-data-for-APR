The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The failing test is indicating that the empty lines are not being handled correctly when there are comments within decorators. 

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and make sure that it correctly handles empty lines in different scenarios. 

One possible fix is to carefully review and rewrite the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it properly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the presence of decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return 0, newlines
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues identified in the failing test and error message and pass the test case.
