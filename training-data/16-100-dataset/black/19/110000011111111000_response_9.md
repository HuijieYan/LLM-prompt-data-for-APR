The issue with the `maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not correctly handling the cases when empty lines need to be inserted. Based on the failing test cases and the expected results, it seems that the function should return the correct number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line, as well as whether an additional empty line should be inserted after the current line.

I will provide a corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided failing and expected test cases.

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, is_yield):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type, value, prefix=''):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value
        self.prefix = prefix

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = max_allowed
        return newlines, 0

    before = 0
    if current_line.depth:
        before = max_allowed - 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and 
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and 
        self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

I've added classes `Line` and `Leaf` to represent the structure within the `maybe_empty_lines` function. I've also included the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the provided test cases and the expected behavior.

This implementation should handle the test cases appropriately and produce the expected results.
