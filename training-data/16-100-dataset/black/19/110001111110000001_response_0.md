The bug is likely caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function not properly handling the number of empty lines to insert before certain elements in the source code. This is causing the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail because the expected and actual outputs do not match.

To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be modified to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before various elements in the source code, such as decorators, import statements, and flow control statements.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review and update the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should handle the insertion of empty lines before various elements in the source code correctly and pass the failing test.
