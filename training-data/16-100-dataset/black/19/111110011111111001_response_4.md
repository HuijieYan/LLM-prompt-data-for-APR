Based on the input parameters and expected values, it seems that the issue lies in the manipulation of the `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. In all the failing test cases, the `before` variable needs to be properly computed based on certain conditions, but the current implementation does not seem to handle these conditions correctly, resulting in incorrect values for `before`.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be modified to properly compute the `before` variable based on the specific conditions provided in each failing test case. Additionally, the function should ensure that the `max_allowed`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` variables are also being handled correctly to produce the expected results.

Here's a possible approach to fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(max_allowed, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(max_allowed, 1), 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

This modified version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should handle the specific conditions provided in the failing test cases and produce the expected values for the variables.

By using this corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
