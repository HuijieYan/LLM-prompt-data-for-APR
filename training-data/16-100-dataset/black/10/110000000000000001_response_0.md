1. The buggy function appears to be designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. It seems to be tracking the current line, current column, and waiting for a new line character. However, there are some logical errors in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the handling of new line characters and the calculation of the current column position.

3. The bug's cause seems to be the mishandling of new line characters and the incorrect updating of the current column position. This is leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   a. Properly updating the current column position when encountering different characters.
   b. Correctly handling new line characters and resetting the current line and column position.

5. Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line = current_line.strip()
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code:
- The handling of new line characters has been adjusted to check if the current line meets the column condition before consuming the prefix.
- The logic for updating the current column position has been adjusted to accurately represent the consumption of characters.
- The function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column.
