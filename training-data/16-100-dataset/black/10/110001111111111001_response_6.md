The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be in how it handles the indentation level and wait_for_nl flag. It doesn't correctly handle the indentation level when encountering spaces or tabs, and also doesn't reset the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering a newline character.

To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering different characters. We also need to update the way `lines` are being appended to ensure the correct alignment of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 1
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should now handle the indentation level and newline characters correctly, as well as handle the appending of lines to maintain the correct alignment of the code. This should satisfy the failing test cases and the expected input/output variable information provided.
