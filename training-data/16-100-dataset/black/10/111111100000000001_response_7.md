Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` as it is not correctly checking whether the current line is empty or not.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume the prefix up to a certain column, but the condition to check for an empty line and the column position is incorrect.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the current line is not empty before evaluating the column position.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle tab characters and new lines.
3. Use the `len()` function to calculate the length of the current line and compare it with the given column.

Corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and len(current_line) <= column:  # Check if the current line is not empty and its length is less than or equal to the given column
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With these changes, the function should now correctly partially consume the prefix up to the specified column.
