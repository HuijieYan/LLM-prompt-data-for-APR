Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix and return the consumed part and the remaining part. The function seems to have issues with handling the indentation within the prefix, which is causing the test failure. The indentation in the prefix is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Bug Cause:
The current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation and new line characters within the prefix. This results in incorrect consumption of the prefix, leading to the failing test.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and new line characters in the prefix. Additionally, the logic for consuming the prefix needs to be adjusted to ensure that the correct result is obtained.

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix, including handling indentation and new line characters. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
