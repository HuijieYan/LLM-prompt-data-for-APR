The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True, it only checks if the current character is a newline character and then proceeds to check if the current column is less than the specified column. However, it doesn't account for the case where the end of the prefix is reached and the column condition is not met. The logic to check for the column condition should be outside the if statement for `char == '\n'`.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle the column condition outside the `char == '\n'` if statement and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when the prefix ends. Additionally, the current line should be added to the lines list when it's collected after the column condition is checked. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # check for the column condition outside the char == '\n' if statement
                if current_column < column:
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        # reset the wait_for_nl flag when the prefix ends
        elif prefix.index(char) == len(prefix) - 1:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
