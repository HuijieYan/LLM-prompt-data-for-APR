The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely the cause of this issue. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix, and yet correctly calculate the column value and handle indentation. However, it currently fails to handle tabulated comments correctly after a dedent.

The problem lies in the logic for handling tab characters and newline characters. The current implementation does not properly handle tab characters and newline characters, leading to incorrect processing of the input prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tab characters and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the indentation is correctly determined and maintained for comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), current_column
```

This corrected implementation properly handles tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` value accordingly. It also correctly handles newline characters to maintain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

With this corrected function, it should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
