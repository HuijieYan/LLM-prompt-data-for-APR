The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be causing incorrect behavior when processing indentation and comments, leading to failing tests and an issue on GitHub.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the logic related to handling the indentation and the wait_for_nl boolean flag. It looks like the function is not maintaining the correct column position for comments after a dedent.

The buggy function is not handling the indentation and newline characters properly, causing incorrect behavior when processing the prefix. This is evident from the failing test's error message, which shows the expected and actual output difference in the indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and comments after a dedent. This may involve reworking the logic related to tracking the current column position, handling whitespace characters, and maintaining the correct indentation level for comments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            break

    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):].lstrip()
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation and comments after a dedent properly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information. This fix should also address the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
