The potential error in the `partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the beginning of each line in the `prefix` string. It needs to correctly track the column number while iterating through the `prefix` string.

The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` as well as the incorrect updating of `current_column` when encountering whitespace characters.

To fix the bug, you should initialize `current_column` to 1 and set `wait_for_nl` to `True`. Then, when encountering a space or tab, you should increment `current_column` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 1  # Initialize current column to 1
        wait_for_nl = True   # Set wait_for_nl to True
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Update the condition to include the specified column
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 1  # Reset current column to 1
                    wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1  # Increment column by 1 for space
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Increment column by 4 for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 1  # Reset current column to 1 for new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the `partially_consume_prefix` function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
