The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and partially consume it up to a specified column. However, the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This can be seen from the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, which compares the expected and actual output for code with tabs and spaces. The error message indicates that the indentation for comments after a dedent is not being handled properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `wait_for_nl` condition. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying when a comment should be indented or not, resulting in incorrect output for comments after a dedent.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the misleading indentation detection within the `wait_for_nl` condition. This leads to the incorrect processing of comments following a dedent, resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This might involve adjusting the logic for indentations within the `wait_for_nl` condition and properly tracking the current column position.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function adjusts the logic for identifying when to wait for a newline and properly accounts for the current column position. This should address the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.

This corrected function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post by handling comment indentation correctly, especially when using tabs.
