The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments properly, which leads to incorrect behavior in the test cases.

Upon analyzing the failing test and the function's code, it is evident that the issue lies in the logic of handling indentation and newlines within the prefix string. The function is not correctly accounting for the indentation levels when dealing with comments.

The failing test specifically checks the indentation of comments after a dedent, and it fails because the function does not preserve the correct indentation in such cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation and newlines within the prefix string.

One possible approach to fix the bug would be to refactor the logic within the function to consider individual lines within the prefix string and handle the indentation based on tab characters and spaces.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = prefix.split('\n')
    consumed_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        leading_spaces = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
        if consumed_lines and leading_spaces < column:
            break
        consumed_lines.append(line)
    consumed_prefix = '\n'.join(consumed_lines)
    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(consumed_prefix):]
    return consumed_prefix, remaining_prefix
```

This corrected version of the function splits the prefix string into individual lines and then iterates over the lines, considering the leading spaces to determine the consumed prefix. It also properly handles the remaining prefix after consumption.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report about incorrect comment indentation.
