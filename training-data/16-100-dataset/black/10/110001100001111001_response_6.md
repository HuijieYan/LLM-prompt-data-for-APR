The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly updating the `current_column` variable when encountering tabs. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the indentation level, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `current_column` variable when encountering a tab in the input `prefix`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        else:
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 3
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should satisfy all the provided test cases.
