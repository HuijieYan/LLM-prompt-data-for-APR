The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it is not correctly handling the prefix it receives. It also doesn't properly calculate the number of characters based on tabs and spaces. This leads to incorrect indentation in the output, causing the failing test cases.

The key problem with the function lies in the handling of indentation levels and newline characters, specifically when calculating the current column and identifying when to wait for a newline character.

To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly calculate the current column by counting the number of spaces and tabs, and then compare it with the provided `column` parameter to determine the correct position to split the `prefix` string. Additionally, it needs to properly handle the 'wait_for_nl' condition and keep track of the lines that have been consumed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        if current_column >= column:
            break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the prefix string and correctly determine where to split the prefix based on the specified column. This should address the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
