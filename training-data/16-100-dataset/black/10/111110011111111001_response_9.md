The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues with consuming the prefix and updating the lines and current_line variables correctly. When there is a new line character, it should also check the indentation of the next line and compare it with the given column value.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of the logic after encountering a new line character.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the lines and current_line variables when encountering a new line character, and it is not correctly comparing the current column with the given column value.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling new line characters and their indentation needs to be improved. Additionally, the logic for updating the lines and current_line variables should be adjusted.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle indentation and new lines, as well as correctly consume the prefix based on the given column value. This should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
