The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to process a `prefix` string and return the first substring that fits within a specified column, and the remaining string. However, the function has several issues causing it to not work properly.

In particular, the function doesn't handle the case when the last line of the prefix doesn't contain a newline character. Additionally, it doesn't handle the case when the `column` parameter is greater than the length of the prefix string. 

To fix the buggy function, the following changes need to be made:
1. Ensure that the `prefix` string is not empty.
2. Check if the `column` value is greater than the length of the `prefix` string, and if so, return the whole prefix as the first substring, and an empty string as the remaining string.
3. Split the prefix string into lines and process each line, keeping track of the current column, and the remaining characters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        if not prefix:
            return '', ''

        if column >= len(prefix):
            return prefix, ''

        lines = prefix.split('\n')
        result_lines = []
        current_column = 0
        for line in lines:
            if current_column + len(line) <= column:
                result_lines.append(line)
                current_column += len(line)
            else:
                remaining = line[column - current_column:]
                result_lines.append(line[:column - current_column])
                return '\n'.join(result_lines), remaining
        
        return '\n'.join(result_lines), ''
```

With the corrected function, it should now correctly process the prefix string and return the expected substrings according to the provided test cases.
