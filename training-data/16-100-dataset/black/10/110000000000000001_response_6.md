Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the if condition `if char == '\n':` and `elif char == ' ':` which are not nested properly. This is causing the function to not handle the new line character properly.

Bug's cause: The function is not handling the new line character properly, leading to incorrect parsing of the prefix and column.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to restructure the if conditions to properly handle the new line character and adjust the logic for handling the prefix and column.

Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the if condition for `wait_for_nl` is properly nested within the else statement, ensuring that the handling of the new line character is done correctly. The logic for handling the prefix and column has also been adjusted to address the bug.
