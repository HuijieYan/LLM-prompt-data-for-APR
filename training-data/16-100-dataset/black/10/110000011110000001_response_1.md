1. The buggy function is meant to partially consume the prefix and return the consumed content and the remaining content. The failing test test_comment_indentation is testing this function and is failing with an assertion error.

2. The potential error location in the function is the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition.

3. (a). The buggy function is not handling the wait_for_nl condition properly, which is causing it to consume the wrong parts of the prefix.
   (b). The failing test test_comment_indentation is comparing the expected and actual content after passing it through the function. The error message indicates that the function is not producing the expected output.

4. To fix the bug, we can revise the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition and also make sure the current column count is updated correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1  # update current column count
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test.
