The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the prefix is entirely consumed before reaching the specified column. Additionally, the logic for handling the indentation with tabs is incorrect. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle these cases and return the appropriate values. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                    return ''.join(lines), current_line

                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
