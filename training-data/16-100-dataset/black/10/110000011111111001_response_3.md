This buggy function is supposed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column value. However, it fails to do so due to incorrect logic.

The bug is likely in the condition where the function compares the current column with the specified column and determines if it needs to return the consumed prefix or continue consuming. The issue seems to be with the handling of the `wait_for_nl` and resetting the `current_column`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checks and updates to accurately handle the logic of consuming the prefix based on the column value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now handle the logic of consuming the prefix based on the specified column value accurately, and it should pass the failing test case.
