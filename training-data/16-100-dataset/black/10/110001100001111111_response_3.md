1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and count the number of spaces and tabs before the main content of the string. The function has issues with maintaining the correct indentation levels when processing the prefix.

2. The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling spaces and tabs, as well as handling new lines and updating the current column.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the correct indentation level when encountering tabs or spaces, leading to incorrect column counts.
   (b). The logic for updating the current column does not account for existing indentation, causing discrepancies in the column count.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates a specific scenario where the indentation of comments is affected by incorrect column counts after dedent operations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Revise the logic for updating the current column when encountering tabs or spaces to accurately reflect the indentation level.
   (b). Adjust the handling of new lines to correctly maintain the current column count after dedent operations.
   (c). Ensure that the function properly processes the indentation of comments, especially after dedent operations, to address the specific issue reported on GitHub.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tabs are equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if not wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should address the issues with maintaining correct indentation levels and better handle the processing of prefix strings, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
