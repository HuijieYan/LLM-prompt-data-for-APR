The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be related to the logic for handling the indentation of comments within the prefix. The issue appears to be that the function is not properly handling the case when the comment indentation is less than the specified column.

The buggy function is trying to consume a prefix string until it reaches the specified column, and then return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling comments and indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in {' ', '\t'}:
            if not current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now properly consume the prefix until the specified column, handling comments and indentation correctly.

By using this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
