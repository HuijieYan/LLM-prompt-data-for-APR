1. The _partially_consume_prefix function is designed to process a prefix string up to a certain column, consuming lines as needed. However, it has a bug causing it to not correctly handle cases where the prefix string ends before reaching the target column.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement where it checks if current_line.strip() and current_column < column. This logic seems incorrect and may be causing the issue.

3. The bug's cause is the incorrect handling of the condition for reaching the target column.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to refactor the logic to properly handle cases where the prefix string ends before reaching the target column.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic has been refactored to properly handle the cases where the prefix string ends before reaching the target column. The condition for reaching the target column has been adjusted and placed before the newline check to ensure it is correctly handled.
