1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes a `prefix` string and a `column` number as input and processes the prefix characters to partially consume the prefix based on the given column. 

2. The potential error location within the function is in the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the current column and the wait for newline flag. The function does not properly handle the indentation and newline characters, which leads to incorrect processing of the prefix.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Revise the logic for tracking the current column and handling the wait for newline flag.
   - Ensure that the function properly processes the indentation and newline characters in the prefix.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected code, the logic for handling the tab character (`\t`) has been modified to properly update the `current_column`. Additionally, the handling of the newline character (`\n`) has been adjusted to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountered.
