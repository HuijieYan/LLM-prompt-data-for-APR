The bug in the given function is that the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is never being met, which means the function will always reach the end of the prefix string and return an empty string as the second value. 

To fix this, we need to keep track of the current line column count and check if it has reached the specified column before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function will now correctly check if the current line's column count has reached the specified column before returning the result, satisfying all the provided expected input/output variable information.
