# Buggy Function Analysis:

This function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column position. It processes each character in the prefix and builds up lines until the specified column is reached.

# Potential Error Location:

The potential error lies in the handling of newline characters and the updating of the current column count.

# Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by the mishandling of line breaks and the column count. When encountering a newline character, the current column count is not reset to 0, resulting in incorrect calculations for the specified column position.

# Approach for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the newline character and reset the current column count to 0 whenever a newline is encountered.

# Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0  # Reset current column count
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current column count when encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the current column count is reset to 0 when encountering a newline character. This ensures that the column count is correctly handled and the function functions as intended.
