It seems that the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the character counting logic. 

When the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` and we encounter a newline character, we need to check the current column before resetting `current_line` and `current_column` to ensure that we don't consume characters beyond the specified `column`. Additionally, the logic for counting spaces and tabs in relation to the `current_column` also seems to be incorrect.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to adjust the logic for counting characters, including spaces and tabs, in relation to the `current_column`, and to ensure that characters are not consumed beyond the specified `column` when `wait_for_nl` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should address the issues with character counting and the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

When tested against the failing test, this corrected code should pass all the cases and produce the expected output based on the given inputs.
