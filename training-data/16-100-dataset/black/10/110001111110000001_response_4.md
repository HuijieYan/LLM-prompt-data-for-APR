Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the parsing of indentation and comments within the '_partially_consume_prefix' function. It is not handling the indentation of comments properly, leading to the failing test.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function '_partially_consume_prefix' is not handling the indentation of comments correctly.
(b). The failing test 'test_comment_indentation' is comparing the expected and actual outputs of the formatting, and it fails due to incorrect indentation handling.
(c). The error message shows that the comment indentation is not being handled properly.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to adjust the handling of indentation and comments within the '_partially_consume_prefix' function. Specifically, the function should correctly identify the indentation level and handle the presence of comments within the code.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
By adjusting the logic, the corrected code should now handle the indentation and comments properly, ensuring that the failing test 'test_comment_indentation' will pass.
