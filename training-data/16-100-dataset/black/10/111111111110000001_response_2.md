The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class which seems to be related to parsing a prefix string. The failing test is testing the indentation of comments in Python code, where spaces and tabs are used for indentation.

The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters, specifically the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation level and the newline characters, leading to incorrect results when consuming the prefix string.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `wait_for_nl` and `current_column` variables needs to be modified to correctly handle the whitespace characters and newline characters.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to rewrite the logic for processing whitespace and newline characters to accurately track the current indentation level and handle the transition from one line to the next.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test for the `Driver` class.
