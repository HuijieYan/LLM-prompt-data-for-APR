The problematic function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on the given column number. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that lead to incorrect behavior. The main issue is that the function fails to account for the newline characters when calculating the current column position and partially consuming the prefix string.

The buggy class `Driver` doesn't seem to be directly related to the issues in the function, as they are independent of each other. The class contains the problematic function, and the function itself is responsible for processing the prefix string.

The expected and actual input/output variable information reveals that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix string based on the column number, leading to incorrect values for the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling newline characters in the prefix string when calculating the current column position and partially consuming the string. This leads to incorrect identification of the column position within the string and causes the function to return unexpected values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling newline characters and updating the current column position accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
``` 

This corrected code should now satisfy all the provided test cases and their expected input/output variable information.
