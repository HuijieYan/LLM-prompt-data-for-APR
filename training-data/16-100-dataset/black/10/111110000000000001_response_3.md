The potential error in the function "partially_consume_prefix" is with the logic for consuming the prefix and determining the current line and column. The function is supposed to consume the prefix up to a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, the logic for tracking the current line and column seems to be faulty.

The bug is caused by the incorrect tracking of the current_line and current_column, as well as the incorrect handling of whitespace and newline characters.

To fix the bug, the logic for tracking the current line and column needs to be revised. Also, the condition for checking if the current_line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for tracking the current_line and current_column has been simplified and the condition for consuming the prefix up to a certain column has been corrected.
