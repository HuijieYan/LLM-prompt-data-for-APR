1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes a prefix and a column as input, and then iterates through the prefix while counting the number of spaces and tabs to determine the current column. 

2. The potential error location is when the function is checking for the condition `if char == '\n'` because the current column count is not being reset in this case. This can lead to incorrect calculation of the current column.

3. The bug is caused by not resetting the `current_column` when encountering a new line character. This causes the column count to be incorrect when starting a new line. The function should reset `current_column` to 0 whenever a new line character is encountered. 

4. One approach for fixing the bug is to add a line `current_column = 0` after the comment `# unexpected empty line` to reset the column count. 

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0  # reset the column count
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
