The problem with the current function is that it is not correctly identifying the completed lines and the remainder of the prefix string. It incorrectly identifies a newline character as the end of a line when it should only do so if the column limit has been reached.

We can fix this by keeping track of the current prefix that has been consumed, and then checking if the current line should be added to the 'lines' list based on the column limit.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_prefix = ""
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_prefix += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_prefix
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_prefix)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_prefix = ""
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            current_prefix = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_prefix
```

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
