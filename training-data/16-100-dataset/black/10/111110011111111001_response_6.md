The problem with the current implementation is that the function is not correctly handling indentation for lines with only spaces and tabs. Additionally, the condition to check if the current_column is less than the input column is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle indentation levels and also keep track of the current column count correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                continue
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                continue
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now handle the indentation properly based on the input column and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
