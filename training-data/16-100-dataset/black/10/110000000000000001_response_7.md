1. The function is intended to consume a prefix up to a specified column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, it appears to have a logic error and incorrect condition checks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking and handling newlines.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly updating the current line and column when encountering a newline character, and the logic for consuming the prefix is incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for handling newlines to correctly reset the current line and column.
   - Revise the logic for consuming the prefix up to the specified column.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
