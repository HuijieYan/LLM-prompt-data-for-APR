The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is experiencing a problem with properly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used in the input. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which describes a similar problem with incorrectly changed indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic that handles the indentation and new lines. It seems that the function is not properly keeping track of the current indentation level and how it should be applied to the comments.

The bug's cause is due to the mishandling of tab characters and the logic for handling new lines and indentation levels. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling tab characters and new lines, ensuring that the function accurately maintains the correct indentation level for comments. Additionally, the function needs to properly handle the indent and dedent logic, considering the presence of both spaces and tab characters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

With this corrected code, the function should now accurately handle the indentation and new lines, ensuring that the comments are properly indented after a dedent. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
