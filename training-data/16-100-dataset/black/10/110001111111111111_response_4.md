The issue is related to the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates this issue, showing that the function is not properly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly determining the required indentation level for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to properly handle the identification of comment indentation after a dedent.

One possible approach for fixing the bug might be to track the current level of indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, and adjust the comment indentation level accordingly. This will ensure that comments are properly indented after a dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_level = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent_level += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent_level += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent_level = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column += indent_level
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function tracks the `indent_level` and adjusts the `current_column` accordingly. Now, the function should properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent and pass the failing test as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should address the issue posted in the GitHub report.
