1. The buggy function is meant to partially consume a prefix string while keeping track of the current line, column, and indentation. The function seems to be related to the GitHub issue as it deals with handling indentation and new lines. The GitHub issue discusses how Black (a code formatter) incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of indentation and new lines, particularly when a dedent is encountered and for tabulated comments.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation. This aligns with the GitHub issue where the indentation is changed incorrectly for tabulated comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for handling indentation and new lines
   - Ensuring that tabulated comments are correctly handled, especially after a dedent
   - Considering the use of a different approach for tracking indentation and new lines

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            if wait_for_nl and char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should properly handle the indentation and new lines, including tabulated comments after a dedent, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
