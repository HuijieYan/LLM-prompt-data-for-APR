Based on the failing test, the error message, and the input/output variable information, it seems that the buggy function is not handling indentation levels correctly, especially when comments are involved.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation and new lines while processing the `prefix` string. This is indicated by the failing test, which is related to comment indentation and the error message which shows incorrect alignment of comments.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the indentation levels and new lines, ensuring that the function processes the prefix string with the correct context of indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        
        if current_column >= column and not wait_for_nl:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation and new lines correctly, ensuring that the input/output variable values match the expected values provided.

Additionally, it should pass the failing test related to comment indentation and avoid the error message that was originally encountered.
