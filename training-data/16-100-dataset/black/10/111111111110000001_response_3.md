The `partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is intended to partially consume a string and return the remaining string after consuming a certain number of characters up to a given column. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the output of this function, which is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the function is in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. It seems like the intent is to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column, but the logic inside the condition is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `current_column < column` is not being properly evaluated, leading to incorrect output.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the condition for checking the current column. Additionally, the logic for appending lines needs to be adjusted to handle the cases where a line does not meet the specified column criteria.

Here's the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                continue
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `partially_consume_prefix` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
