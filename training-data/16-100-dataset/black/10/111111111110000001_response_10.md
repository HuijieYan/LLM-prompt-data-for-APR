The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag, which is not reset when a newline character is encountered after an indent. This results in the incorrect returning of the consumed prefix.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when a newline character is encountered after an indent. This causes the function to prematurely return the consumed prefix, leading to the incorrect output and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be reset when a newline character is encountered after an indent, so that the function continues to consume the prefix until the specified column is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the `wait_for_nl` flag and satisfy the failing test.
