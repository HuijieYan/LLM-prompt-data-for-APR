In the given function, the issue appears to be with the logic for updating the `current_column` and the `wait_for_nl` variables. The logic for counting spaces and tabs, as well as handling newlines, seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to correctly count spaces and tabs, as well as handle newlines to determine correct indentation and column values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
