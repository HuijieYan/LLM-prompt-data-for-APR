1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle indentation levels and partially consume a prefix based on a given column. The GitHub issue is related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when the input file uses tabs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles the indentation level and waiting for a new line.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect calculation of the current column and the handling of tabs and new lines. The function does not handle tabs properly, which results in the incorrect indentation when dealing with comments.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Revising the logic for handling tabs and new lines to ensure that the indentation is maintained correctly.
   - Verifying the indentation calculation and adjusting it to accurately reflect the input file's tabs and new lines.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column % 4 == 0:
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by properly handling tabulation and new lines, ensuring that the indentation is maintained correctly even when dealing with comments after a dedent. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
