The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class. It is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. The potential error location in the function is the condition for checking if the character is a newline (`\n`). 

The cause of the bug is that the indentation is being reset on encountering a newline character, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly when encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the `wait_for_nl` variable and handled the newline character directly. Now, the `current_column` is correctly updated for the newline character as well.
