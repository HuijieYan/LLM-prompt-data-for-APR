The buggy function is named `_partially_consume_prefix` and it is called within the failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the file `tests/test_black.py`. The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing because the actual output does not match the expected output.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely related to how it handles the indentation and newline characters. Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the function is not handling the indentation and newline characters correctly when consuming the prefix.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix and determining the remaining string based on indentation and newline characters. This results in incorrect output when comparing the expected and actual results in the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation and newline characters and correctly determine the remaining string based on the column parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly consume the prefix and handle the indentation and newline characters, allowing it to pass the failing test.
