Potential error location: The bug may be causing incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, leading to an incorrect result.

Bug's cause: The function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, resulting in an incorrect output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Keep track of the current indentation level and handle it properly.
2. Ensure that newline characters are handled correctly to maintain the column position.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
