The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when the character is a newline (`\n`) and `wait_for_nl` is True, it should reset `current_line` and `current_column`, but it doesn't. This causes incorrect output in the cases provided.

To fix this bug, we can reset `current_line` and `current_column` when the character is a newline and `wait_for_nl` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                # reset current_column
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code ensures that `current_line` and `current_column` are reset when a newline is encountered and `wait_for_nl` is True, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
