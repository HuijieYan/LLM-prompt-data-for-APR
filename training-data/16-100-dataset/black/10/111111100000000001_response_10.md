1. The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" is a method of the class "Driver" which seems to be responsible for parsing input data and checking for indentation levels. It processes the input prefix character by character, updating the current line and column count as it goes.

2. The potential error location within the function seems to be the condition for checking if "char" is equal to '\n' and "current_column" is less than "column". This condition should be checked before the condition for "wait_for_nl", as it is related to the indentation level and should be evaluated first.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect ordering of the conditions within the for loop. Checking for the newline and column level condition should be the first priority before checking for whitespace and tab characters.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reordering the if statements to first check for the newline and column condition.
   - Refactoring the logic to use a clearer and more efficient method for tracking and updating the current line and column count.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # The corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
In the corrected code, the reordering of the conditions ensures that the newline and column level condition is checked before the whitespace and tab characters. This should fix the bug and improve the function's behavior.
