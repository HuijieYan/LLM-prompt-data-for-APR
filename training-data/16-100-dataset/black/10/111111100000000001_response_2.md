Potential error location: The 'wait_for_nl' flag is not being reset to False after a newline character is encountered, which causes the function to incorrectly keep waiting for a newline.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number. It processes the characters of the prefix string one by one and builds lines, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newline characters, and the target column number.
(b) The buggy class is a part of a larger program and this function is used to handle prefix strings in a specific way.
(c) The related functions might depend on the correct operation of this function for proper functioning of the program.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the 'wait_for_nl' flag to False after a newline character is encountered.
2. Handle the case where the target column number is reached before encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag to False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Handle the case where the target column is reached
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag to False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
