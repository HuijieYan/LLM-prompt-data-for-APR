The bug in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the indent and the logic to partially consume the prefix based on the column value. The function does not correctly handle the indentation using spaces and tabs, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the column value, accounting for spaces and tabs, and handles newline characters appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == '\t':
                if current_column + 4 <= column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
