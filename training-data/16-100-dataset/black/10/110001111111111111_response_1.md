The issue is related to the indentation of comments being incorrectly changed after a dedent. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the prefix string and column and adjusting the indentation.

The error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition and the calculation of the current column.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl condition and the calculation of the current column. This causes the function to incorrectly adjust the indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition and the calculation of the current column. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct column is calculated for each character in the prefix, and that the wait_for_nl condition is properly reset when encountering a new line.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the prefix string and column input correctly. It should also pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.
