The issue seems to be with the logic for determining the indentation column. The current implementation does not handle the indentation level properly.

Based on the failed test and the input/output information, it seems that the function does not correctly handle the indentation levels when encountering comments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately calculates the indentation level and correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and address the issues identified with the failing test cases.
