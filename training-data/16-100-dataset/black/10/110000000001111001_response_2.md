The bug in the function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of indentation levels and the wait_for_nl condition. The wait_for_nl condition is not being properly reset after encountering a new line, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the indentation level is not being properly calculated, causing issues with the column count.

To fix the bug, the wait_for_nl condition should be reset to False after encountering a new line. Additionally, the calculation of the indentation level should be corrected to accurately reflect space and tab characters.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_line[-1] != '\t':
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset wait_for_nl
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
