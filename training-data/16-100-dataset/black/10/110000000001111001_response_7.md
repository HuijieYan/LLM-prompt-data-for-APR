The problem in the code is that the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not checking for the proper number of columns. The variable `current_column` is always being reset to 0 and it's not properly updated when spaces or tabs are encountered.

To fix the bug, we need to keep track of the number of spaces and tabs in the `current_column` variable. We should also properly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when a new line is encountered.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # check if the current_line is not empty and the number of columns is less than required
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
