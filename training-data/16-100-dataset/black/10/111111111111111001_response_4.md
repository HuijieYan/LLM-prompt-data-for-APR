The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when there is a newline character (`\n`) in the input prefix, it does not properly handle the indentation level. This causes the function to return incorrect values.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when the function encounters a newline character, it resets the `current_line` and `current_column` values according to the correct indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the newline characters and indentation, and pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
