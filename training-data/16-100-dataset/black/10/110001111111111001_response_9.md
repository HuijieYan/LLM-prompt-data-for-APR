The issue with the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it does not handle the case where the current_line is not empty when the wait_for_nl condition is met. This causes the function to return an incorrect result. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the case where the current_line is not empty and the wait_for_nl condition is met. We can update the logic to check if the current_line is non-empty before adding it to the lines list. 

Here is the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():  # check if the current line is non-empty before adding it to the list
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip():  # check if the current line is non-empty before resetting it
                current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this updated logic, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now correctly handle all cases and pass the failing test.
