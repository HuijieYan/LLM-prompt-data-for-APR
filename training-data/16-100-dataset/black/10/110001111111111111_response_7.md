The problem lies in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function which is responsible for processing the indentation and comments. The issue appears to be related to the handling of comments after an indent or dedent. This is causing incorrect indentation for comments in the processed output, leading to failing tests.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the reformatted code with the expected output. The error message indicates that the reformatted code does not match the expected output for the input provided.

The failing tests and the related GitHub issue both suggest that the indentation for comments is being incorrectly modified after a dedent. This could be due to how the function handles the wait_for_nl flag and updates the current_line and current_column variables.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to revise how the function handles the wait_for_nl flag and the updating of the current_line and current_column variables. The function should correctly account for the indentation of comments after an indent or dedent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation and comments after an indent or dedent more accurately. It has been revised to properly update the current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables based on the input characters, which should address the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
