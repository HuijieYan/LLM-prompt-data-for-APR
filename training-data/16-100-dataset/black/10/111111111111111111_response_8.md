The potential error in the problematic function lies in the logic for handling indentation when the prefix contains spaces, tabs, or new lines.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the scenario when the comment is at a deeper indentation level than the previous line.

The issue is related to how the function is handling the indentation level while iterating through the prefix string. It is not correctly determining the indentation level and does not handle cases where the comment is at a deeper level than the previous line.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic responsible for tracking the current indentation level and handling the indentation of the comment.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function handles the indentation and comment scenarios correctly and should resolve the issue.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved with the corrected function.
