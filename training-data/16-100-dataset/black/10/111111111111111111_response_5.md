The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if char == '\n':` combined with `wait_for_nl = True`. This leads to incorrect behavior when the comment is on the same line as the code, causing the comment indentation to be incorrect.

The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling newline characters when determining the indentation level for comments. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling newlines, and the computation of indentation levels for comments. We can modify the code so that the logic for handling comments is independent of whether the comment is on the same line as the code or not.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This corrected code should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
