Potential error location: The issue may be with the logic that determines when to append `current_line` to `lines`. It seems that the `wait_for_nl` condition is not triggering as expected, leading to incorrect processing of the `current_line`.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to split a string `prefix` at a specific `column` position. It does so by iterating over the characters of the prefix and accumulating them in `current_line`. When the accumulated characters reach the desired column, the function should return the result and the leftover characters.
(b). The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates that the function does not correctly split the string at the specified column position. This is evident from the assertion error where the expected and actual strings do not match.
(c). The error message provides the comparison between the expected and actual strings, clearly indicating that the function is not handling the indentation and comments properly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Revise the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition to correctly append the `current_line` to `lines` when the desired column is reached.
- Make sure that the function correctly handles different types of characters, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters, in determining the column position.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly split the `prefix` string at the specified `column` position and pass the failing test.
