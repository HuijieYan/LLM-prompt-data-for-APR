The issue is related to the incorrect handling of comment indentation in the source code when using tabs. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected formatting result with the actual formatting result using the `assertFormatEqual` method. The test fails, indicating that the comment indentation is not being handled correctly.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is identified in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. This condition is intended to check if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the provided column parameter, indicating that the comment should be indented. However, the calculation of `current_column` and the conditional logic is not accurate and is causing the incorrect behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `current_column` is not being correctly calculated when encountering tabs or spaces. The logic for handling indentation and newlines is flawed, leading to incorrect results when formatting the comments.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the `current_column` and handling indentation, as well as newlines, needs to be revised. Additionally, the conditions for checking if the comment should be indented need to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code now correctly handles the calculation of `current_column` for tabs and spaces and also adjusts the logic for handling newlines and indentation detection.

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
