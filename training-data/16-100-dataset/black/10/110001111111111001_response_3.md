Based on the input parameters, expected results, and failing test scenarios, it appears that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the indentation properly, specifically when encountering `'\t'` and `' '` characters. Additionally, the condition for checking the column and returning the result is not correct.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the indentation based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                break
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected results for all provided input parameters.
