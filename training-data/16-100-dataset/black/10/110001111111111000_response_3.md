The issue in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation and column count when encountering a newline character. It also returns the incorrect result in certain cases. Below is the corrected function based on the provided test cases:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line + char)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 0 if char != '\t' else 4
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function includes handling for wait_for_nl and the correct update of current_line and column values based on the encountered character. It also appends the new line to the lines list when necessary.

The corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation and column count when encountering a newline character. It should also return the correct result in all test cases.
