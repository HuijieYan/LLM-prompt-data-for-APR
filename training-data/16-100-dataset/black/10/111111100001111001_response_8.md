The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the given `prefix` string up to a certain column value. However, there are a few issues with the function that need to be addressed:
1. The `current_column` value is not being updated correctly. It should be incremented only when a space or tab character is encountered, but the function is currently incrementing it for every character, including newlines and non-whitespace characters.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset properly after encountering a newline character. This might cause the function to miss consuming the prefix correctly.
3. In some cases, the function returns unexpected output because of the incorrect handling of `wait_for_nl` and `current_column`.

To fix these issues, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` conditions, and the logic for building the `lines` list needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                continue
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` conditions, and return the expected output for the given input parameters.
