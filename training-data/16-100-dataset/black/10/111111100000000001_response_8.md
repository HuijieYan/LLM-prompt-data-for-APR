1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class within the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file. This function is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on a specified column value.

2. The potential error seems to be related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition and the calculation of the `current_column`.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition, which results in incorrect parsing and splitting of the prefix string.

4. To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition to correctly track the new line and column positions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char

            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the `wait_for_nl` condition is properly handled, and the new line and column positions are calculated as expected. This should address the bug and ensure the function works as intended.
