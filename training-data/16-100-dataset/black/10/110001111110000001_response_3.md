The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. The issue seems to arise from how the current_line and lines are being handled within the loop.

Looking at the failing test and error message, it seems that the problem is related to handling indentation and comments. In the failing test, it's trying to compare the formatting of two strings with different indentation styles. The error message indicates a mismatch in the comparison due to the presence of a comment.

The potential error in the function lies in the logic for handling the indentation and comments. The function is not correctly handling the indentation with spaces and tabs and the position of comments in the input strings.

To fix the bug, we can change the logic for processing the prefix string. More specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of indentation and the position of comments.

The corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # reset the wait_for_nl flag
                wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to handle different types of indentation and the position of comments correctly. This updated function should satisfy the failing test.
