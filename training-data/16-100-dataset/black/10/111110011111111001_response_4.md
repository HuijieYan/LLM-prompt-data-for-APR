The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle prefix lines that are longer than the specified column. It also does not properly handle prefix lines that contain tabs in terms of calculating the column number. Additionally, the existing logic does not seem to handle the case where the prefix is empty correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle these edge cases and properly calculate the column number for lines that contain tabs. It should also handle the case where the input prefix is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            
        if char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle all edge cases correctly and should produce the expected results for the failing test cases.
