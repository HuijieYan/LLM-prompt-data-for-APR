The issue seems to be with the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It is not correctly handling the cases where indentation (spaces or tabs) is followed by a comment and then no more indentation is present. 

Looking at the failing test and the error message, it seems to be failing when a comment is not aligned correctly. This is confirmed by the expected and actual values of the failing test cases.

The bug appears to be in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` within the loop. This condition is checking if the current line's content has any non-whitespace characters, which is incorrect as we only need to check for indentation. If no indentation is found, it should return the result.

The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset properly after a new line character is encountered.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to keep track of the indentation length, detect when the indentation ends, and return the result. Additionally, reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when a new line character is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indentation = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_indentation < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_indentation = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_indentation += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indentation += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_indentation = 0  # reset the current indentation
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the given failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
