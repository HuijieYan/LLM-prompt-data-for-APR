                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The function was corrected to properly handle the indentation and newline characters in the prefix. Now it should behave as expected and pass all the failing test cases.
