1. The buggy function, _partially_consume_prefix, is a method of the Driver class. It takes a prefix and a column as input and processes the prefix while keeping track of the current line, column, and waiting for newlines.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for handling newlines and indentations, as well as the condition for returning the result when the column limit is reached.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of newlines and indentations, leading to the function not properly consuming the prefix and returning the remaining prefix.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adjusting the logic for handling newlines and indentations, ensuring proper tracking of the current line and column, and revising the condition for returning the result when the column limit is reached.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling newlines and indentations is adjusted to ensure proper consumption of the prefix. The condition for returning the result when the column limit is reached is also revised to correctly return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
