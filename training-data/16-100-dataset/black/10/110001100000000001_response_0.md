The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column, but it contains a logical error that prevents it from functioning properly.

The potential error location is the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` inside the if statement for `wait_for_nl`. This condition should be checking if the length of `current_line.strip()` is less than the `column`, not if it's truthy, and then it should return the result and the remaining prefix.

The bug is caused because the current condition is not correctly evaluating whether the current line has exceeded the specified column. It only checks if the line is not empty and the column is less than the specified column. This logic is incorrect and does not accurately determine if the function should return the result and the remaining prefix.

To fix the bug, the condition inside the `if wait_for_nl` should be modified to compare the length of the stripped `current_line` with the `column` to determine if the column limit has been reached.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(current_line.strip()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code modifies the condition inside the `if wait_for_nl` to compare the length of the stripped `current_line` with the `column`. This change ensures that the function correctly determines whether to return the result and the remaining prefix.
