The issue with the buggy function (_partially_consume_prefix) is that it does not correctly handle the cases where the prefix ends without a newline character. In those cases, the lines list is not being properly updated and returned.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the prefix ends without a newline character by appending the current line to the lines list before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    res += current_line
    return res, ""
```

This corrected code should handle all the cases mentioned in the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
