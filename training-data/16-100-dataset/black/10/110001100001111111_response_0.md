The issue described in the GitHub post and the failing tests indicate that the problem occurs when the buggy function encounters comments with tabs in an indented block of code. The function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column value and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, it fails to handle indentation correctly when encountering comments with tabs.

The problem seems to be occurring when the function encounters a tab character while waiting for a new line. This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the current_column value, leading to the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments with tabs.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling tab characters and ensure that the current_column value is calculated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # calculate the number of spaces required to reach the next tab position
            current_column += num_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles tab characters by calculating the number of spaces required to reach the next tab position and updating the current_column value accordingly. This ensures that the function correctly handles indentation for comments with tabs.

This corrected function should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information for the failing tests and should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
