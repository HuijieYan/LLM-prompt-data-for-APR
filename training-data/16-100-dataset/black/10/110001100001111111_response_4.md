The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix and split it into lines based on the given column. The issue here seems to be with the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation. The function seems to incorrectly calculate the column and wait_for_nl flags, leading to incorrect indentation when splitting the prefix into lines.

By analyzing the expected and actual variable values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling tabs and spaces for indentation, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix into lines.

The GitHub issue also mentions the problem with indenting comments incorrectly after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the input file.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling tabs and spaces for indentation and adjusting the column and wait_for_nl flags accordingly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to refine the logic for handling tabs and spaces for indentation, ensuring that the correct column and wait_for_nl flags are set based on the input prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line.strip('\t'))  # Remove leading tabs before adding to lines
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column based on current position
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should handle tabs and spaces for indentation properly, ensuring that comments are correctly indented after a dedent. It should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
