The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation in the provided prefix. When encountering a newline character, it should check if the current line's indentation level is less than the specified column. If so, it should consume that line and continue until the indentation level exceeds the specified column, at which point it should stop consuming lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation and newline characters properly while consuming the prefix.

After applying these changes, the failing test cases should pass as the function now correctly preserves the specified indentation levels.
