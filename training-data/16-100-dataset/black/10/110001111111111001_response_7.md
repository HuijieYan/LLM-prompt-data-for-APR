The issue with the current implementation is that when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True and a newline character is encountered, the function does not account for the case where the `current_column` is less than the specified `column`. Instead, it resets the `current_column` to 0 and waits for the next newline character, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic inside the loop to correctly handle the case when `current_column` is less than the specified `column`. We also need to make sure that the last line in the prefix is correctly appended to the `lines` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    if current_line.strip():
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
