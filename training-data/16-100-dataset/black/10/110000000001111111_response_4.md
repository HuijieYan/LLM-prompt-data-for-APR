The problem appears to be related to the handling of indentation and newline characters in the input prefix string, particularly when mixed with tab characters. This becomes clear when we examine the relationship between the expected and actual input/output variable information, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue.

The bug is caused by the function incorrectly updating the current_column and wait_for_nl variables when encountering tab characters. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level, especially when mixing spaces and tabs.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling tab characters and their impact on the current_column and wait_for_nl variables. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and preserves the original indentation level of comments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now handle tab characters correctly and preserve the original indentation level of comments, satisfying the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and newline characters, ensuring consistent formatting regardless of the presence of tabs in the input data.
