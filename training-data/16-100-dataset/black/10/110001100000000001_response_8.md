1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. It initializes some variables and then iterates through the prefix character by character. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and a flag to wait for a newline character. If a space or tab is encountered, it increments the current column accordingly. If a newline is encountered, it checks if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column value. If so, it concatenates the lines and returns the result. Otherwise, it adds the current line to the lines list and resets the current line and column. If any other character is encountered, it sets the flag to wait for a newline.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column value when encountering a newline character.

3. The bug's cause is that the logic for checking if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column value is flawed. This is resulting in incorrect behavior when partially consuming the prefix.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reworking the logic for checking the current line and column when encountering a newline character.
   - Using a different approach to track the current line and column to ensure accurate partial consumption of the prefix.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for checking the current line and column when encountering a newline character has been reworked to ensure accurate partial consumption of the prefix. The condition for checking the current line and column has been properly placed within the if block for encountering a newline character.
