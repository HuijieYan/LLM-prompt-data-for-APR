The issue with the current function is that it fails to correctly calculate the indentation level when consuming the prefix string. The `current_column` variable is not being updated properly, causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the increase in the `current_column` variable when encountering tabs or spaces.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
