The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that when `wait_for_nl` is `True`, it never gets reset to `False`, causing the function to not properly process the prefix. This results in incorrect values for `res` and the remaining prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to properly reset `wait_for_nl` to `False` after it has been used to handle a new line character.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl to False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function properly resets the `wait_for_nl` variable to `False` after it has been used, ensuring that it can correctly handle new lines and process the prefix as expected.
