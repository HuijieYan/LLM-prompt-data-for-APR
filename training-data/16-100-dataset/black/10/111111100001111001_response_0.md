The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is in the logic for checking the indentation level. The function should return the consumed prefix along with the remaining portion of the prefix. However, it currently has issues with tracking the current column and checking for newline characters.

To fix this bug, the logic for tracking the current column and handling newline characters needs to be corrected.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to correctly update the `current_column` based on the encountered characters and to handle the newline character properly to determine the correct indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
