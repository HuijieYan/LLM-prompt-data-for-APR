The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'wait_for_nl' condition. It doesn't handle the case when a comment is encountered after dedent and it is not indented properly.

The bug is caused because the 'wait_for_nl' condition does not properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect reformatting of the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the 'wait_for_nl' condition to handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly.
2. Adjust the logic to properly track the column and indentation levels when encountering comments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().endswith(':'):  # check if the line ends with ':'
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # set wait_for_nl only if the line does not end with ':'
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
