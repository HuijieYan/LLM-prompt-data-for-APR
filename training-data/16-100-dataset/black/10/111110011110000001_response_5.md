The buggy function is a method called _partially_consume_prefix within the Driver class. The failing test function test_comment_indentation is trying to compare the output of _partially_consume_prefix for two different input strings, but it is failing with an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the _partially_consume_prefix function is the condition for wait_for_nl. This condition is not being properly reset, leading to incorrect logic when encountering a newline character.

The bug's cause is that the wait_for_nl flag is not properly being reset after processing a newline character, causing the function to incorrectly process subsequent characters.

To fix the bug, the wait_for_nl flag should be reset to False after the current_line has been processed when encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False # Reset wait_for_nl flag
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the _partially_consume_prefix function should now pass the failing test.
