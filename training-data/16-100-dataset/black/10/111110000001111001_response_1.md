The potential error in the code is in the condition for checking `wait_for_nl` in the if statement:

```python
if wait_for_nl:
    if char == '\n':
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
    ```

The issue lies in the `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` condition. This condition checks if the `current_line` is not empty and `current_column` is less than `column`. Instead, this condition should check if `current_column + len(current_line) <= column`. This is necessary to verify if the current line length exceeds the required column, and if it does, return the result accordingly.

Another issue is with the second return statement which triggers when the loop finishes. In this case, the correct return value should be `prefix`, not `current_line`.

The corrected code should be as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column + len(current_line) <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return prefix, ''
```
