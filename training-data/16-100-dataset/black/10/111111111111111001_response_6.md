Potential error location: The issue appears to be in the logic for checking the column location of the prefix content.

Bug's cause:
The logic for updating the `current_column` and the `wait_for_nl` variable is incorrect. The logic doesn't properly handle tab characters and doesn't accurately check the column value against the given input `column`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add logic to properly handle tab characters and calculate the updated value of `current_column` accordingly.
2. Update the logic to accurately compare the column value against the given input `column` and handle cases where the column value exceeds it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code includes adjustments to properly handle tab characters, accurately check the column value, and update the function logic to satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
