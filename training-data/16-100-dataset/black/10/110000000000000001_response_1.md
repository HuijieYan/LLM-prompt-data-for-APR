1. The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column and then return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, there are issues with handling newlines, spaces, and tabs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is around the logic for handling newlines, spaces, and tabs, as well as the condition for checking the column.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles newlines, spaces, and tabs, which leads to incorrect consumption of the prefix and calculation of the remaining prefix.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Revise the logic for handling newlines, spaces, and tabs to accurately calculate the consumed prefix and remaining prefix.
   b. Use proper conditional checks to determine when to consume the prefix and reset the column count.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:  # check if the current column is less than the target column
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
