Potential error location: The if statement `if char == '\n':` is outside of the `wait_for_nl` condition, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering a new line character.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to capture lines of a text string based on a given column, but it fails to properly handle new line characters when `wait_for_nl` is True.
(b). The buggy class `Driver` contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column.
(c). The related functions are the string manipulation operations performed within `_partially_consume_prefix`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Move the condition `if char == '\n':` inside the `wait_for_nl` condition block to properly handle new line characters.
- Adjust the logic to accurately track the current column position and handle new lines.

Corrected code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
