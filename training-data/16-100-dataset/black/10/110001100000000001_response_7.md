The buggy function "_partially_consume_prefix" takes a prefix string and a column as input and processes the prefix string character by character. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it is waiting for a new line. It then returns the processed lines and the remaining prefix string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of newlines. The function checks for newlines and indents within the prefix string, but it does not correctly update the current column and handle the new lines.

The bug's cause is that the function does not properly handle indentation and new lines, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation and new lines within the prefix string.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we properly handle indentation and new lines by updating the current column and resetting it when encountering a new line. We also correctly handle the wait_for_nl flag to ensure the correct processing of the prefix string.
