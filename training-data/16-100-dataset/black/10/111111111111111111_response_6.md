The issue is due to the incorrect handling of indentation when there is a combination of tab and space characters in the input code. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is improperly handling the indentation and tab characters, leading to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

The bug is caused by the way the function is calculating the current column and determining when to wait for a newline character. It is not correctly handling the tab character, which is causing the issue with the indentation of comments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and adjust the current column based on the tab width. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a newline character and the handling of empty lines needs to be adjusted.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            pass
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now properly handle tab characters and adjust the current column based on the tab width. It also adjusts the logic for waiting for a newline character and the handling of empty lines.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
