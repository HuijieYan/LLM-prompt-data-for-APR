The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely within the logic that checks for a newline. It appears that the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column is not being properly handled. This is evident from the input/output variable value discrepancies, where the function is returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking if the current column is less than the specified column needs to be corrected. Additionally, the handling of newlines and indentations should be adjusted to ensure the function operates as expected.

The corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is as follows:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and handle the given test cases correctly.
