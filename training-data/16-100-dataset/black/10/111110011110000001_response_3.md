Potential error location:
The potential error in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters when consuming the prefix.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of spaces and tabs, as well as the newline characters. This results in the incorrect output when consuming the prefix, leading to the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust how the function handles the indentation of spaces and tabs, as well as the newline characters.
2. Update the logic for consuming the prefix to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It should now correctly consume the prefix and pass the failing test.
