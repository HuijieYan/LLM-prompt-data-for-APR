The buggy function is causing incorrect indentation for comments when the input file uses tabs. This is evident from the expected and actual input/output variable values provided, as well as the GitHub issue describing a similar problem.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the tab character ('\t') and counts it as 4 spaces instead of 1.

The bug's cause is likely the mishandling of tab characters, which results in incorrect indentation for comments when the input file uses tabs. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description and the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the indentation based on the tab width. This can be achieved by replacing the logic for tab characters with a function that counts the number of spaces a tab represents and updates the current_column accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4 spaces
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
This corrected function should now handle tab characters correctly and calculate the indentation based on the tab width, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
