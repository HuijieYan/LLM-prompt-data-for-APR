1. Analysis:
The function '_partially_consume_prefix' is a method of the 'Driver' class. It takes two parameters, 'prefix' and 'column'. The function processes the 'prefix' string character by character and handles indentation and newline characters based on the 'column' parameter. The function is supposed to return a pair of strings: the processed prefix and the remaining prefix string.

The input/output variable information provided for the failing tests shows that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual values of 'lines', 'current_line', 'current_column', 'wait_for_nl', 'char', and 'res'. The GitHub issue describes a problem related to indentation of comments after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

2. Potential error location:
The potential error in the function seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and indentation level tracking.

3. Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function does not handle tab characters properly when tracking the current column for indentation.
(b) The 'wait_for_nl' flag is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect handling of newline characters and comments.
(c) The discrepancy in actual output values compared to expected values indicates that the function is not correctly processing the input.
(d) The GitHub Issue suggests that the problem is related to indentation of comments after a dedent, specifically when tabs are used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
(a) Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly track the current column for indentation.
(b) Review the logic for updating the 'wait_for_nl' flag to ensure proper handling of newline characters and comments.
(c) Verify the handling of comments and indentation after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_column += spaces_to_add
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
The corrected code includes proper handling of tabs, updating the 'wait_for_nl' flag, and ensuring correct tracking of the current column for indentation. This should address the issues observed in the failing tests and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
