The issue in the function is that when the current line contains only whitespace, the columns are incorrectly calculated, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of the current column when encountering spaces or tabs. Additionally, the logic for updating the current line and other variables needs to be modified.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to track the actual column position by counting the leading whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        leading_whitespace = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and leading_whitespace < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    leading_whitespace = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                leading_whitespace += 1
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                leading_whitespace += 4
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                leading_whitespace = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                leading_whitespace += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, it should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
