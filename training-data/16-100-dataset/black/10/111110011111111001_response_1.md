The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and consume part of it up to a certain column. The function has a bug where it's not consuming the prefix correctly and causing the failing test.

The error is likely caused by the incorrect handling of whitespace characters, such as tabs and spaces. The conditional statements for checking if the character is a tab or space and updating the `current_column` are incorrect. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines and empty lines needs to be revised.

To fix the bug, we can take a different approach to handle whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines. Below is the corrected version of the code that should address the issues:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            elif current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the given column, handling tabs, spaces, and newlines as expected. This should resolve the failing test scenario and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
