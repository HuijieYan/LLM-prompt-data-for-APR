The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string and splitting it into lines based on a given column number. The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. This is indicated by the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and the detailed description in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the indentation and waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`).

The bug's cause is that the function doesn't correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect formatting of the comments, as seen in the failing test and the GitHub issue information.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, ensuring that the comments are properly aligned based on the given column number.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. This check ensures that comments are properly aligned based on the given column number. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
