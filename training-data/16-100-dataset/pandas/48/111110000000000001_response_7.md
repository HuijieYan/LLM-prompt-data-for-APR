1. The buggy function is a method within the DataFrameGroupBy class. It appears to be responsible for performing aggregation on data within a GroupBy object. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the handling of exceptions and the conditional logic for different cases of how the aggregation is performed.

3. The buggy function attempts to aggregate data within a GroupBy object, but there are several conditional logic statements that handle different scenarios. This makes the function complex and difficult to debug. The potential cause of the bug could be related to how the conditional logic is handling exceptions and different aggregation scenarios.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include simplifying the conditional logic and error handling within the function to make it more readable and less error-prone. Additionally, breaking down the function into smaller, more manageable parts could improve its maintainability and allow for easier debugging.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, aggregate_error = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        if aggregate_error:
            if alt:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Aggregation method not implemented")
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected code, the conditional logic for handling different aggregation scenarios has been simplified and the handling of exceptions has been improved. This should make the function more readable and less error-prone.
