The issue seems to be caused by improperly casting values to the incorrect data type. To fix this, we need to carefully cast the values to ensure they match the expected data type. Here's an updated version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (loop logic)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype != block.dtype:
                raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {block.dtype} to {result.dtype}")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the function should handle data type casting errors more gracefully. This update ensures that improper typecasting is avoided and raises a `TypeError` with an appropriate error message when non-equivalent data types are encountered during the process.
