Based on the given information, the bug is related to a data type casting issue. The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the 'safe' rule.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the part where type casting is being performed, specifically when trying to cast values from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Using explicit type casting to ensure that the values are casted from float to integer in a safe manner.
2. Handling the nullable integer values separately to avoid type casting issues.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # existing code continues...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...
        if result is not no_result:
            # existing code...

            if result is not no_result:
                if block._can_hold_na:
                    result = result.astype(float)
                else:
                    result = result.astype(int)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we added conditional type casting to handle nullable integer values separately. This would help to resolve the type casting issue and pass the failing test.
