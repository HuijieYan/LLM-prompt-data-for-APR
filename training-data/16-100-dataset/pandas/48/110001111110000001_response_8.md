Looking at the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies in the safe casting of values from float to int64. The error message indicates that there is an error in casting from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'.

To fix this bug, we need to review the safe casting process and ensure that the casting is handled properly for float to int64 conversion. It seems that the error is occurring when trying to cast float values to integer values.

The corrected code for the problematic function would involve checking for the datatype of the values before the casting operation and converting the values properly to the required datatype without any loss of precision or information. Additionally, handling the conversion of NA or missing values should also be taken into consideration.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if numeric_only:
            # Check if the data is float and then convert to int64
            if pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(block.values):
                block.values = block.values.astype('Int64')
                block.dtype = 'Int64'

        # ... (existing code)

    # ... (existing code)
```
In this approach, we check if the block values are of float dtype using `pd.api.types.is_float_dtype()` and then convert the values to 'Int64' dtype to handle the safe casting properly.

By ensuring proper handling of safe casting and conversion, the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should pass the failing test and resolve the TypeError related to safe casting of values from float to int64.

Additionally, it's important to consider the use of nullable integers and missing values (NA) while performing the casting and aggregation operations.

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected code with various scenarios involving float to int64 conversions and ensure that it passes the failing test without any errors related to safe casting.
