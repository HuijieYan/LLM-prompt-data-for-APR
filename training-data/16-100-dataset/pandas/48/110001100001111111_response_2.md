The issue appears to be related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the new nullable integer data type. The bug seems to be occurring in the _cython_agg_blocks function, specifically in the part where it tries to aggregate the data. It seems that the implementation is not handling the nullable integer data type correctly when calling the mean function.

The expected output from the GitHub issue is to obtain the mean of the 'b' column grouped by the 'a' column. However, the actual output is resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this, we need to update the _cython_agg_blocks function to handle the nullable integer data type when calling the mean function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check the data type of the column before performing the aggregation. If the data type is nullable integer, then we can filter out the NA values before calculating the mean. This can be achieved using the dropna function.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            obj = obj.dropna()
            result = obj.groupby(self.grouper).agg('mean').values
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated code will handle the nullable integer data type appropriately when calling the mean function, and should resolve the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub thread.
