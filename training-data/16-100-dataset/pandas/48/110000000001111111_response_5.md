The issue is that using the new nullable integer data type ('Int64') with the `groupby` and `mean` operations results in a TypeError. This issue is also observed with other operations like median and std.

The bug is located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where the `self.grouper.aggregate` method is used to perform the aggregation. It seems that the function is not handling the nullable integer data type correctly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the nullable integer type appropriately to avoid the TypeError when performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values.astype('float64'), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle NotImplementedError
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same...

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the nullable integer data type by using the `astype('float64')` method before performing the aggregation operation. This should resolve the TypeError issue.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
