The buggy function is intended to perform aggregation on data, but there are multiple issues within the function that need to be addressed. One of the main issues is that the variable `agg_block` is being appended to the list `agg_blocks` without being properly initialized. Additionally, the logic for splitting object-dtype blocks into separate lists is not correctly handling cases where the result is a DataFrame instead of an ndarray. 

To fix the issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Initialize the `agg_block` variable before using it to store the result of aggregation.
2. Update the logic for handling object-dtype blocks to properly handle cases where the result is a DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

        agg_block: Block
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            elif isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                # This condition handles the case when result is a DataFrame
                # and correctly encapsulates the logic for splitting object-dtype blocks
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue
            else:
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining logic for handling split_items unchanged)
```

By initializing the `agg_block` variable and updating the logic for handling object-dtype blocks, the corrected code addresses the issues present in the original buggy function.
