The issue with the buggy function is that when the `how` parameter is set to 'median', 'var', or other aggregation methods that are not applicable to the nullable integer data type, it results in a TypeError. This is consistent with the GitHub issue where calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError, and the error also occurs with median and std.

The error occurs within the `try` block of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where the `group.aggregate` method is called. In this block, there is a lack of handling for TypeError exceptions specifically for the 'median', 'var', and other non-applicable aggregation methods with nullable integer data.

To fix the bug, the `try` block should be expanded to include separate `except` blocks for handling TypeError exceptions for the non-applicable aggregation methods. These `except` blocks should handle the specific scenarios where TypeError occurs for 'median', 'var', and other non-applicable aggregation methods with nullable integer data, and provide an appropriate alternative action or error handling.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except TypeError:
            if how in ['median', 'var']:
                raise NotImplementedError(f"'{how}' not applicable to nullable integer dtype")
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise the original TypeError for other cases

        # ... (existing code)

    # ... (existing code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this correction, the function now includes specific `except` blocks to handle TypeError exceptions for non-applicable aggregation methods with nullable integer data. It raises a NotImplementedError for 'median' and 'var' methods, and re-raises the original TypeError for other cases, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
