The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data based on certain criteria but has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the aggregation process and the creation of `agg_block`.

The root cause of the bug may be related to how the function is handling the result and the specific aggregation method being used. It's possible that the aggregation method is not being applied correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to review the aggregation method being used and ensure that it is being applied correctly to the data. Additionally, the creation of the `agg_block` should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately represents the aggregated result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Handling of the result
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i * loc : (i + 1) * loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should properly handle the aggregation of data based on the specified criteria and provide the expected output based on the input parameters.
