1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and is related to the `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate` methods in the same class, as well as the `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate` functions from another class in the same file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of the `Block` objects and the `DataFrame` objects, especially when dealing with split items and split frames.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to how the function handles the aggregation of data and the manipulation of `Block` objects. The way it iterates through the data blocks, splitting items, and creating `agg_blocks` might be causing unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the logic for splitting items and creating `agg_blocks`, ensuring that the handling of different types of data (numeric and non-numeric) is done correctly, and handling the exceptions for certain operations properly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# Fixed and corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            result = result.reshape(1, -1) if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1 else result

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
