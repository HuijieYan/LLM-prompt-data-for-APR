The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the class `DataFrameGroupBy` and is called by the methods `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate`. It takes input parameters `how`, `numeric_only`, `min_count`, `alt`, and `self`, and uses them with the block and data to perform aggregation. The problematic code seems to be handling of the aggregation result and updating the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists.

The cause of the bug is likely in the handling of the aggregation result and the update of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists. This is evident from the discrepancies in the actual `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` values compared to the expected ones, as well as the processing of the block and result variables.

A possible approach to fixing the bug could be to carefully handle the aggregation result according to the desired behavior, updating the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` lists as required, and ensuring the correct indexing and assignment of values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, locs = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Assuming there is no splitting of blocks, as it's not clear in the provided information

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should handle the aggregation result and updating of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` more effectively, addressing the issue with the buggy function.
