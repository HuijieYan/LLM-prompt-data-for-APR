1. The buggy function appears to be an aggregation function that operates on a BlockManager object. It checks the data for numeric values and aggregates them based on the specified method. The function also handles splitting object-dtype blocks and includes error handling for certain cases.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the try-except block where it handles the aggregation of block values. Specifically, the error may be related to how the function deals with non-numeric data or splits object-dtype blocks.

3. The bug's cause likely stems from the handling of non-numeric data or the splitting of object-dtype blocks when applying aggregation methods. Additionally, there could be issues with the indexing and updating of the BlockManager objects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include refining the error handling for non-numeric data, ensuring proper handling of split object-dtype blocks, and reviewing the indexing and updating processes for the BlockManager objects. Additionally, it may be beneficial to streamline the code for clarity and efficiency.

5. Here's the corrected code with potential fixes:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # Changed to _get_numeric_data method

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result  # Moved the result assignment outside the try-except block
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count  # Changed the order of argument in the aggregate method
            )
        except TypeError as e:
            if alt is None:
                raise e
            else:
                # Added code to handle alternate aggregation method
                result = alt(block.values)
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                    result = result.values

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

The corrected code includes changes such as using the proper method for getting numeric data, adjusting the order of arguments in the aggregate method, and handling the alternate aggregation method. These changes aim to address the potential issues identified in the buggy function.
