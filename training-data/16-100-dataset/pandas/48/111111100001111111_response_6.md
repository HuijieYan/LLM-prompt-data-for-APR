The issue seems to arise from using the nullable integer data type (Int64) in the DataFrame. The error occurs when calling aggregation functions like mean, median, and std on grouped data.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block that handles the aggregation operation. The issue seems to occur when the dtype of a column is Int64, leading to a TypeError when performing aggregation operations.

It is possible that the buggy function is not handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) correctly when performing aggregation operations.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) properly when performing aggregation operations. This may involve converting the nullable integer data type to a regular integer data type before performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Convert Int64 to regular integer data type
    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            block.values = block.values.astype('int64')

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this modification, the function should correctly handle nullable integer data type (Int64) and perform aggregation operations without raising a TypeError.
