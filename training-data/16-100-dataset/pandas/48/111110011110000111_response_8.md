The bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions after grouping with a nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype. This results in a TypeError related to casting from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe' in the `integer.py` module.

The cause of this bug is related to handling nullable integers during the aggregation process, specifically when casting from float to integer. The error message from the failing test indicates that the issue is occurring in the safe_cast function when trying to cast the values to the specified dtype.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated to handle nullable integers correctly during the aggregation process, ensuring that the casting from float to integer is performed in a way that avoids the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should handle nullable integers correctly and avoid the TypeError when performing aggregation operations.
