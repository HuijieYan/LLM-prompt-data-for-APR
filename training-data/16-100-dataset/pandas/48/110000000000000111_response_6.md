1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used for aggregation of blocks in pandas. The GitHub issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype which results in a TypeError. The issue can be related to the aggregation process where the function fails to handle the nullable integer data type properly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block where the grouping is being performed and the aggregation function is being applied to the data.

3. The bug's cause is that the function in its current state is not handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly, leading to a TypeError when performing aggregation functions like `mean`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the data type and handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) separately in the aggregation process.
   - Validating the data type compatibility with the aggregation function to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values
        if hasattr(result, "dtype") and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
            result = result.astype("float64")  # Convert to float for aggregation
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(pd.unique(np.concatenate(new_items)))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the nullable integer data type by converting it to float for aggregation to ensure compatibility with the `mean` function and resolves the issue described in the GitHub post.
