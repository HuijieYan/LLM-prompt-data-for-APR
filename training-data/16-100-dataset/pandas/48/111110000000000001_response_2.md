The potential error in the code lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function is responsible for creating aggregated blocks based on the input data. 

The potential bug could be caused by several factors such as incorrect aggregation logic, improper indexing, or handling of split items.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the aggregation logic is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the indexing and handling of split items are accurately performed.
3. Address any potential issues related to the handling of deleted items.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block = self._create_agg_block(result, block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reorder the items based on the aggregated blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    self._reset_block_locs(agg_blocks, indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items


def _aggregate_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    # Add logic here to aggregate the block based on how and alt
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        return result
    except NotImplementedError:
        # Handle the exception or continue as needed
        return None


def _create_agg_block(self, result, block):
    # Add logic here to create a new aggregated block based on the result
    agg_block = block.make_block(result)
    return agg_block


def _reset_block_locs(self, agg_blocks, indexer):
    # Add logic here to reset the locs in the aggregated blocks based on the indexer
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc
```
