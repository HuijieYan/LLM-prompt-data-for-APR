The issue seems to stem from the `how` parameter value being set to 'mean', 'median', or 'var' in the GitHub issue, which is then used in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to aggregate the data. The problem occurs when calling these functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type, as evidenced by the provided example and the expected output.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly in the section where the aggregation is performed, as it directly deals with the input parameters and data aggregation process.

To fix the bug, one possible approach could be to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function correctly handles the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation, allowing the 'mean', 'median', and 'var' functions to be applied without raising a TypeError. This might involve modifying the data handling and aggregation process to account for nullable integers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code for handling split items and returning the result remains the same

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected code should handle the nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregation, resolving the TypeError issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
