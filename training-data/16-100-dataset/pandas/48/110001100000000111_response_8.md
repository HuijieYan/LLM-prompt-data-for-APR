The issue described in the GitHub post seems to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This issue occurs when using the new nullable integer data type and calling functions like mean, median, and std after grouping.

The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be involved in the aggregation process after grouping and has potential error locations at the following points:
1. Handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) during aggregation.
2. Exception handling related to the type of agg result and dtype inference.
3. The manipulation of DataFrameGroupBy objects using block operations.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is a problem with calling mean after grouping with Int64 dtype. This leads to a TypeError, but the issue does not occur when calling min, max, or first. Additionally, the error does not occur when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy to calculate the mean. This information suggests that the problem might be related to the handling of nullable integer data type during aggregation.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Check and handle the special cases related to the nullable integer data type (Int64) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially during aggregation operations like mean, median, and std.
2. Inspect the exception handling in the function to ensure that the type of result and dtype inference are handled correctly for different aggregation functions.
3. Verify the handling of DataFrameGroupBy objects and make necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with nullable integer data types.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.agg(how, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = np.array([i])  # Adjust locs for the block

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the function has been simplified to iterate through the data blocks and apply the aggregation function directly to each block. The nullable integer data type (Int64) is handled by using the `agg` method of the blocks, ensuring that the aggregation functions like mean, median, and std are correctly handled. Additionally, the adjustments to the locs in the blocks have been modified to correspond to the current ordering. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
