The issue is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

The problem is likely within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, where it attempts to cast values from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe', which is not possible due to the presence of nullable integer data type.

The bug's cause has been analyzed using the provided information:

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` attempts to cast floating point values to integers, leading to a TypeError due to the presence of nullable integer data type.

The potential fix for the bug is to handle nullable integer data type specifically by explicitly converting it to float type before aggregation operations, to avoid the TypeError caused by attempting to cast to 'int64'.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # rest of the code remains the same

    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code remains the same

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            # handle nullable integer data type specifically
            if is_integer_dtype(result) and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = result.astype(float)  # convert to float type

            # rest of the code remains the same

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By explicitly converting nullable integer type to float before aggregation operations, we prevent the TypeError caused by attempting to cast to 'int64'.

This corrected code should fix the issue and pass the failing test, resolving the problem posted in the GitHub issue.
