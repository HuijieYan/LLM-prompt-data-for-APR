The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error occurs due to a safe cast from dtype float64 to int64, which is not allowed according to the 'safe' casting rule.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is trying to cast float64 to int64, which is not allowed for nullable integers.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type correctly. Specifically, the safe_cast function is causing the TypeError, and it needs to be adjusted to handle nullable integers properly.

Here is the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count)
        
        # cast the result to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The changes include handling the result correctly and avoiding the safe_cast function. This corrected version of the function should now handle nullable integers properly and pass the failing test.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well, ensuring that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype no longer results in a TypeError.
