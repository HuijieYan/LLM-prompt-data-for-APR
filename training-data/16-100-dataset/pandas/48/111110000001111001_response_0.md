The buggy function is trying to aggregate data within a group, but there seems to be an issue with the aggregation logic. The result obtained from the aggregation process is not as expected in all the test cases.

Based on the input parameters and the returned variable values, it appears that the issue lies in the aggregation logic, specifically in the calculation of the aggregate values. The result is consistently off by a factor of 0.5 in all the test cases.

To fix this issue, the aggregation logic needs to be reviewed and potentially corrected to ensure that the aggregate values are calculated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        agg_values = None

        # Perform aggregation according to the specified how method
        if how == 'mean':
            agg_values = block.values.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        elif how == 'median':
            agg_values = block.values.median(axis=1, skipna=True)
        elif how == 'var':
            agg_values = block.values.var(axis=1, skipna=True)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(agg_values)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the aggregation logic is revised to use the appropriate methods for calculating the aggregate values based on the specified how method. This should address the issues observed in the original buggy function.
