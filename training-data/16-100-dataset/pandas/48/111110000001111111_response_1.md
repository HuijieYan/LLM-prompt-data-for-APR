The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the nullable integer data type when using the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object. The bug seems to be located in the aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the DataFrameGroupBy class.

The issue is reproducible when using the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) for the DataFrame, and then calling the `mean` function after grouping by a column. The bug results in a TypeError. This behavior is not observed when using the standard integer data type (`int64`) or when selecting a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy.

To fix the bug, the aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be adjusted to handle the nullable integer data type properly when calculating the mean.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function ensures that the aggregation logic properly handles the nullable integer data type when calculating the mean, resolving the TypeError issue.

This fix should address the problem described in the GitHub issue and make the `mean` function work correctly with nullable integer data types in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
