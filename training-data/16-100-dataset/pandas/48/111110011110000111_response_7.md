The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64. The issue arises when performing the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions after grouping a DataFrame with Int64 dtype.

The problem seems to be related to the safe casting of values to the dtype, which is resulting in the TypeError. This issue is critical because it prevents the mean, median, and var functions from working with nullable integer data types.

To fix this bug, the safe cast operation needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer data type more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.values):
            result = block.values.astype(float)
        else:
            result = block.values.astype(object)

        # existing code...
    
    # existing code...
```

In this corrected code, we check if the block values are of integer dtype. If they are, we cast them to an object type to accommodate nullable integers. This ensures that safe casting is performed without raising a TypeError.

I would recommend submitting this fix as a pull request to the pandas repository on GitHub.
