After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the TypeError is occurring due to the use of the new nullable integer data type ('Int64') in the DataFrame. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing to handle this new datatype correctly, resulting in a TypeError when calling mean, median, and std functions after grouping.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated to handle the 'Int64' datatype properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._astype('float')  # Convert all columns to float for consistent calculation

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Construct the new index
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle the nullable 'Int64' datatype by converting the data to float for consistent calculation using the `data._astype('float')` method. We also use the `_try_aggregate` method to attempt aggregation, which can handle nullable integer data properly.

This corrected code should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean, median, and std on a DataFrameGroupBy with 'Int64' datatype.

I would recommend testing this corrected code with the provided failing test cases to ensure it resolves the issue as expected. Once verified, the correction can be submitted as a pull request to resolve the GitHub issue.
