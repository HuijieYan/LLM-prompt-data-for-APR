Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly in the handling of data types during aggregation. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting array from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. This implies that there is an issue with safely casting non-equivalent data types.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the data types are handled correctly during aggregation, taking into account nullable integers and floating-point numbers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic around data type handling and casting in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It might be necessary to add explicit checks for the data types and handle nullable integers and floats appropriately when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    # for checking nullable integers and floats
    nullable_int_dtype = np.dtype("Int64")
    float_dtype = np.dtype("float64")

    # Filter the columns for nullable integers and floats
    if numeric_only:
        numeric_data = data.select_dtypes(include=[nullable_int_dtype, float_dtype], copy=False)
    else:
        numeric_data = data

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

This correction explicitly checks for nullable integers and floats and handles them appropriately for aggregation operations. This should ensure that the data types are handled correctly during aggregation, addressing the `TypeError` related to casting array from dtype 'float64' to 'int64'.

It's important to note that the actual fix might require more intricate changes to the function, depending on the complexity of data type handling and aggregation operations.
