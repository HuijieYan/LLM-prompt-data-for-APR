The error is occurring when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This is likely due to an issue with safely casting the values to the desired dtype.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data type appropriately, ensuring that the values are correctly cast to the desired dtype. 

It seems that the function is not handling the nullable integer data type properly, leading to errors during aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
  
    # Existing code here...

    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code here...
        if min_count < 0 or locs.shape[0] >= min_count:
            result = block.values
            if result.dtype.type == np.float64:
                # Convert to nullable integer if applicable
                result = result.astype("Int64")
            # Rest of the code remains the same...

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring that the values are cast to the correct dtype, we can resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. After implementing this fix, the failing test should pass without any TypeErrors, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
