The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64. This is happening within the `safe_cast` function.

The failing test is trying to perform various aggregations on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer values, and it's encountering the TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError when using the new nullable integer data type.

It seems that the issue lies in the safe casting of values within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where it's trying to cast float64 values to int64, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the safe casting logic needs to be adjusted to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately. This may involve treating nullable integers as floats when performing calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.internals.managers import Block, BlockManager
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.arrays.integer import coerce_to_array

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Rest of the code for the function...

    # Fix for safe casting of values for nullable integers
    def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
        if isinstance(values.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        try:
            return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
        except TypeError as err:
            casted = values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            if (casted == values).all():
                return casted
            raise TypeError(
                f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
            ) from err

    # Rest of the code for the function...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By adding a condition to check for nullable integers in the `safe_cast` function and handling them as floats, we can address the TypeError that was occurring.
