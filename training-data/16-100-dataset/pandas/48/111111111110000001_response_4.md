The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is throwing a `TypeError` when trying to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64`. This error occurs when `casted` and `values` are not equivalent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking the data types of the values to ensure that the safe cast can be performed.
- Using conditional logic to handle the safe cast based on the data type of the values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []  # moved to top to ensure split_items is defined for cleanup
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []  # moved to top to ensure split_frames is defined for cleanup

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...

        result = block.values.astype(float)  # cast values to float
        if result.dtype == np.float64:
            # Perform the safe cast only if the resulting dtype is float64
            casted = result.astype(np.int64, casting="safe")

            if (casted == result).all():
                result = casted
            else:
                raise ValueError("Casting failed due to non-equivalent values")

        # Existing code...

    # Existing code...
```

With this correction, the function should successfully pass the failing test.
