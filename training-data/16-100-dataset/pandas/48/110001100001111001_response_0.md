The buggy function is trying to aggregate data using different functions based on the input parameters. It seems to be encountering issues when processing the aggregation, specifically when handling the result and the dtype of the blocks.

The potential error location could be in the processing of the result of the aggregation and handling the dtype of the blocks.

To fix the bug, you can consider updating the code to properly handle the results of the aggregation and ensure that the dtype of the blocks is appropriately handled.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[sum(len(b.mgr_locs) for b in agg_blocks[:i]) : sum(
            len(b.mgr_locs) for b in agg_blocks[: i + 1]
        )]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code focuses on directly aggregating the data and properly assigning the result to the aggregated blocks. It also handles the indexing of the aggregated items correctly.

This code should address the issues identified and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
