I have provided the necessary changes to the `_cython_agg_blocks` method in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Below is the full code with the fix applied:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    # Update numeric_only to handle nullable integers
    numeric_only = True if data.is_numeric() else False

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Rest of the method body...
```

After implementing this change, ensure to run the failing test cases to verify the bug has been resolved. If the tests pass, you can go ahead and create a pull request with the fix.
