The purpose of `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be to aggregate DataFrame blocks into new blocks. It seems the error is occurring when trying to cast values to integer using the `safe_cast` function. Based on the error message, the function is trying to convert a float64 value to an int64 but is encountering an error.

The issue may be caused by the DataFrame columns being of type `Int64` (nullable integer) and the function is attempting to cast them to non-nullable integer which causes the error.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Union, cast

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    """
    Aggregate DataFrame blocks into new blocks.

    Parameters:
    - `how`: str, the aggregation function to be used.
    - `alt`: Any, an alternative aggregation function.
    - `numeric_only`: bool, whether to consider only numeric columns.
    - `min_count`: int, the minimum number of items required for the aggregation.

    Returns:
    - A tuple containing the aggregated blocks and the index.

    TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    """
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            # Attempt the aggregation with the primary function
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # If the primary function is not applicable and no alternate function is provided, raise an error
                raise ValueError("No valid aggregation function found.")

            # If an alternate function is provided, attempt the aggregation with it
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(alt)

        new_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(new_block)
        agg_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    # Concatenate the new items
    indexer = np.concatenate(agg_items)

    # Retrieve the corresponding items based on the indexer
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function first attempts to perform the aggregation using the primary function. If that fails and an alternate function is provided, it uses the alternate function to perform the aggregation. The float to int casting issue has been avoided by refraining from unnecessary casting.

This should resolve the casting issue and allow the function to perform the aggregation correctly.
