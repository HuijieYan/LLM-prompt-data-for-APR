The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to how it handles aggregation of data and the creation of blocks. This function seems to encounter an error when trying to perform the aggregation and block creation, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the aggregation and block creation more robustly. One potential approach is to refactor the aggregation and block creation logic to ensure it can handle different aggregation methods and create the blocks correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[Index] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._get_aggregated_result(how, alt, min_count)

        agg_block = block.create_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        agg_items.append(agg_block.items)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we have simplified the aggregation logic and block creation process, ensuring that it can handle different aggregation methods and create the blocks correctly. This should address the original bug and provide the expected functionality.
