The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. The cause of this bug seems to be related to the way the aggregation is being handled in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the `Int64` dtype properly during aggregation. It seems that the issue arises when trying to cast the values from `float64` to `int64`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types.

One possible approach to fixing this bug could be to add a check in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the special case of `Int64` dtype values. When encountering `Int64` dtype values, we should ensure that the aggregation is performed using floating-point arithmetic to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if data._is_integer_na_type:
        if how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
            result = data._try_aggregate_numeric()
            return [result], data.items

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we added a check for `Int64` dtype values when the aggregation method is "mean", "median", or "var". If the data is of `Int64` dtype and the aggregation method is one of these, we attempt to aggregate the data using floating-point arithmetic to avoid the TypeError.

This correction should ensure that the aggregation functions work correctly for `Int64` dtype values when called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub problem and should also resolve the failing test cases related to calling aggregation functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns.
