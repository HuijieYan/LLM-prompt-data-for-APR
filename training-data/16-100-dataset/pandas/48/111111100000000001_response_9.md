Potential error location: There appears to be an issue related to handling of split object-dtype blocks. In particular, there is inconsistency in handling the split frames.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by inconsistencies in handling split object-dtype blocks, potentially leading to incorrect aggregation of data and unexpected behavior in the function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
One approach for fixing the bug could be to ensure consistent handling of split frames and object-dtype blocks during the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


class DataFrameGroupBy:
    # ... (other functions)

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> Tuple[List[pd.core.internals.blocks.Block], pd.Index]:
        data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data._get_numeric_data()
    
        agg_blocks = []
        new_items = []
        deleted_items = []
        split_items = []
        split_frames = []
    
        no_result = object()
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                
                s = obj.groupby(self.grouper)
                result = s.agg(alt)
                
                if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
                    result = result.to_numpy()
                
            if result is not no_result:
                result = pd.core.internals.managers.maybe_downcast(result, block)
                new_block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(new_block)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise pd.errors.DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        if split_items:
            for locs, frame in zip(split_items, split_frames):
                for i in range(frame.shape[1]):
                    new_items.append(np.array([locs[i]]))
                    new_block = frame.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0]
                    agg_blocks.append(new_block)
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
        offset = 0
        
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected code, we have updated the handling of split frames to ensure that they are consistently added to `agg_blocks` and `new_items`. We have also updated the way the result is obtained from the groupby object and cast to numpy array if needed. Lastly, we have used the appropriate methods and attributes for the `DataFrameGroupBy` instance.
