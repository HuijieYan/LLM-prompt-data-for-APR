The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used for aggregating data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object, and it seems to be producing incorrect results when used with numeric-only data.

The potential error location within the `cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be the calculation of the mean. It appears that the function is not handling `Int64` dtype data correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when the `mean` function is called.

The cause of the bug may be due to the incorrect handling of `Int64` dtype data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which leads to the `TypeError` when the `mean` function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
1. Adding a specific handling for `Int64` dtype data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the `mean` calculation is performed correctly for this data type.
2. Reviewing the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that it can handle different data types appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected implementation of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        if isinstance(block, ExtensionBlock) and block.dtype == 'Int64':
            result = block.values.astype('float64').mean(axis=1)
        else:
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # remaining code for handling split blocks and returning the results
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected implementation explicitly checks for the `'Int64'` dtype and converts the values to `float64` before calculating the mean to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly for this data type.
