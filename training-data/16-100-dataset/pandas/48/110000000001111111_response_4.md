The issue is likely occurring due to problems with applying the `mean` function to a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The bug appears to be in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the logic related to grouping and applying aggregations to the data blocks.

The function should be modified to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately, without causing a TypeError. This likely involves adjusting the logic for aggregation and potentially handling the nullable integer data type explicitly.

Additionally, the GitHub issue describes the expected output and the actual problematic behavior when using the `mean` function with nullable integer data types.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be updated to handle nullable integer data types when applying aggregations such as `mean`. The function should explicitly account for nullable data types and handle them appropriately to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
import pandas as pd  # if not already imported

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_type('block', errors='coerce')  # Convert to nullable integer type

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, I've added a conversion to the nullable integer type when `numeric_only` is True, to handle the nullable integer data appropriately. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and account for the nullable data type when applying aggregations.
