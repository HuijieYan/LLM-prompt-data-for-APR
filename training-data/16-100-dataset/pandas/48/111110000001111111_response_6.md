The issue is caused by an error in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function is not handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly while trying to perform aggregation operations like mean, median, and standard deviation.

The problem is identified in the way the function handles the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations. This results in a TypeError when using certain operations like mean, median, and std.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle nullable integer data type appropriately during aggregation operations by checking for null values and applying the operation accordingly.

Based on the expected input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, we can suggest the following approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for null values in the nullable integer data type and handle them appropriately during aggregation operations.
2. Ensure that the function can handle nullable integer data types in a way that is consistent with the expected behavior for aggregation operations.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, skipna=True
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for null values in the aggregation operation by using the `skipna=True` parameter. This will ensure that the function can handle nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregation operations, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
