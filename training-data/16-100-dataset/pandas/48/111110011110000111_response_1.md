The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing the error because it is attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, resulting in a TypeError. This is happening when trying to call the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling nullable integer dtype properly when performing aggregation operations, resulting in a TypeError when attempting to cast float64 values to int64.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer dtype properly and avoid attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            if result is not None:
                if hasattr(block.values, "dtype") and "Int" in str(block.values.dtype):
                    result = result.astype(block.dtype)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this corrected code, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now properly handle nullable integer dtype and avoid attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

This should resolve the TypeError when calling mean, median, and var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype and pass the failing test cases.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well.
