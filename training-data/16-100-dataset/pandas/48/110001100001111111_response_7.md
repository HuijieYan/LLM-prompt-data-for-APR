The issue is likely caused by the handling of nullable integer data types in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `pandas` library. This is evident from the provided GitHub issue, which indicates that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the 'Int64' dtype results in a TypeError. The issue occurs with other aggregation functions such as median and std as well.

Based on the provided input and output variable information, it seems that the problem lies within the processing of the data blocks and the aggregation results. The function is not handling the nullable integer data type appropriately during aggregation operations, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to incorporate proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation, ensuring that it is compatible with the expected behavior for mean, median, std, and other aggregation functions.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas` library:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        try:
            if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.number):
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # existing code...

            if alt is not None:
                # existing code...
                result = s.agg(alt)
                # existing code...

        # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

In this corrected code, the aggregation operation is explicitly checking for numeric data types using `np.issubdtype` and appropriately handling the nullable integer data type during mean, median, std, and other aggregation operations.

This should resolve the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the 'Int64' dtype as reported in the GitHub issue.
