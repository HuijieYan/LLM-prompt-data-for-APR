The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to perform aggregation on the data, but there seems to be an issue with the result and how it's being handled. The main problem seems to lie in the result variable, which is an ndarray, but it's being processed as if it's a DataFrame in some parts of the code. This leads to inconsistencies in handling the result data and eventually causes the issues in the function.

To fix this bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the result of the aggregation is consistently treated as an ndarray rather than a DataFrame.
2. Check for any unnecessary code that specifically handles DataFrame results and replace it with appropriate handling for ndarrays.
3. Make sure that the logic for handling different types of aggregation results is consistent throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the result of the aggregation is consistently treated as an ndarray, and unnecessary handling for DataFrames has been removed. Also, the consistency of logic for handling different types of aggregation results has been improved.
