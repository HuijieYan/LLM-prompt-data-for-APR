The issue seems to be related to how `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are being calculated. Looking at the provided runtime values and types, the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` seem to be correctly populated, so the correction should be focused on the other calculations within the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# corrected version of _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # other parts of the code

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # other parts of the code
        
        if block.ndim > 1:
           obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
           s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
           try:
               result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
           except TypeError:
               deleted_items.append(locs)
               continue
           
           result = cast(DataFrame, result)
           result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        # remaining part of the code

    # remaining part of the code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Make sure to incorporate these changes in other parts of the code as well.
