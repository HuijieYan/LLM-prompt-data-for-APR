Analysis:
The buggy function is the `_cython_agg_blocks` function from the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. This function is responsible for aggregating data using the Cython library. It seems that the function is encountering issues with casting values from float to int64 and vice versa. The failing test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is attempting to apply various aggregation functions to data with nullable integer dtype and expects the results to be of type float. The error messages indicate that there are type casting issues when trying to perform these aggregations.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly when attempting to cast values from float64 to int64 and vice versa.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It appears that the function is not handling the required type casting for nullable integer dtypes and is resulting in type casting errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the type casting logic to handle nullable integer dtypes correctly and perform the required type conversions for aggregations.
2. Ensure that the function can handle the specific datatype involved in the failing test, i.e., nullable integer dtype and expected float results.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # Perform type conversion for nullable integer dtypes to float
            if is_nullable_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
                result = result.astype(float)

            # Append the rest of the existing logic for aggregation

    # Existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected code, the main change is to ensure that when the result is a nullable integer dtype, it is correctly cast to float before being appended to the aggregations. This should address the type casting issues and allow the function to pass the failing test.
