The bug in the function seems to be related to the aggregation of data. The 'how' parameter is used to determine the aggregation method, and it seems to be causing issues with the aggregation of the data.

The 'how' parameter is used to determine the aggregation method, and it seems to be causing issues with the aggregation of the data. The function is not handling the 'how' parameter properly, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'how' parameter is being properly used to perform the desired aggregation operation on the data.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if how in ['mean', 'var', 'median']:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid 'how' parameter")

        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the 'how' parameter is properly used to determine the aggregation operation to be performed. Additionally, a check for valid values of the 'how' parameter is added to handle any invalid inputs.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the given input/output variable information.
