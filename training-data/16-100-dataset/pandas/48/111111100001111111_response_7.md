The issue seems to be related to TypeError occurring when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. Based on the provided information, the bug is likely within the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the class `DataFrameGroupBy`. It seems to be related to the computation for mean, as well as other aggregation functions like median and std.

The bug seems to be caused by a discrepancy in handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the mean calculation within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly. This may involve adding specific handling for nullable integer data type in the mean calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.dropna().get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._cython_agg(how, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This code handles nullable integer data type (`Int64`) by first dropping NA values and then getting the numeric data. Then, it applies the aggregation using the `_cython_agg` method in each block.

This revised code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue by properly handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when calculating the mean and other aggregation functions.

This issue can be solved using this approach, and the corrected code should address the problem and produce the expected output.
