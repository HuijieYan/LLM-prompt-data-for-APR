The issue seems to arise when calling mean on a DataFrame with a nullable integer data type (Int64). It triggers a TypeError, which prevents the expected output from being achieved. The problem does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but occurs with median and std as well.

To fix this issue, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy class needs to be modified as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    agg_result = data.groupby(self.grouper, axis=self.axis).mean(min_count=min_count)

    if how == "median":
        agg_result = data.groupby(self.grouper, axis=self.axis).median(min_count=min_count)
    elif how == "var":
        agg_result = data.groupby(self.grouper, axis=self.axis).var(min_count=min_count)
    # Add additional elif statements for other cases as needed

    agg_items = agg_result.items
    agg_blocks = agg_result.blocks

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In this fix, we're using the `groupby` function directly on the `data` BlockManager to apply the aggregation method based on the input parameter `how`. This approach should address the TypeError issue while enabling the mean, median, and var methods to work properly.

This fix is a suggestion based on the provided information. It may need to be adjusted based on the overall context of the codebase and the specific requirements of the DataFrameGroupBy class.
