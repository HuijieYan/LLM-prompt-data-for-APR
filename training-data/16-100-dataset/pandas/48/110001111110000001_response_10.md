The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering an issue with safely casting non-equivalent float64 values to int64. This is happening when attempting to perform operations related to calculating the mean, median, or variance on nullable integers.

The potential cause of the bug seems to be related to the data type conversion and handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is not handling nullable integer types properly when attempting to cast them from float64 to int64. This issue is leading to a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent casting.

To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integer types should be improved in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially when it comes to safely casting float64 to int64. This might involve ensuring that the appropriate type checks and conversions are performed on the data to correctly handle the nullable integer values.

Based on the error message and failing test cases, it is clear that the conversion from float64 to int64 is causing the TypeError. It appears that the test is specifically designed to handle nullable integer values, and the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is preventing the test from passing.

It is recommended to handle nullable integers separately and ensure that the type conversions support nullable integer types properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the case for nullable integers
            if pd.api.types.is_nullable_dtype(block.dtype):
                result = block.values  # Skip type conversion for nullable integers
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise the NotImplementedError for other cases

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
        
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged to handle the aggregation and return the results
```

In the corrected code, a specific check is made for nullable integer types, and in such cases, the result is set directly without attempting any type casting. For other cases, the existing code for handling aggregation is retained.

This change should address the issue with casting non-equivalent float64 to int64 for nullable integer values and allow the failing tests to pass.
