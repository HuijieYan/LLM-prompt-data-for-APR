The bug in the code is due to the NumPy integer type being used inappropriately. The code is trying to cast float values to the integer type, which results in a TypeError. To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use a suitable NumPy data type for the calculation. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)

        if numeric_only:
            # Use the appropriate NumPy type for the aggregation
            # For example, if the result is a float, use float64
            if result is not no_result:
                result_dtype = result.dtype
                if np.issubdtype(result_dtype, np.integer):
                    result_dtype = np.float64
                    result = result.astype(result_dtype)

    # ... (previous code)
```

This modification will handle the appropriate casting of the data to the correct NumPy data type, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring previously. After making this change, the bug should be resolved and the test cases should pass without any issues.

I would also recommend submitting a bug report and creating a pull request for this fix on the Pandas GitHub repository. This will help the Pandas development team to review and merge the fix into the main codebase.
