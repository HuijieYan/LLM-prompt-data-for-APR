Certainly! Here is the full corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(block.values.dtype, np.integer):
                result = result.astype(block.values.dtype)
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise NotImplementedError("Custom handling of NotImplementedError required")

        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, additional checks and type conversions are added to ensure that the result of aggregation is properly handled when dealing with nullable integer data. This should address the type casting issue that was causing the TypeError and make the function pass the failing test.
