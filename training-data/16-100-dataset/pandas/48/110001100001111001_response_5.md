The buggy function is supposed to aggregate data using different statistical functions, such as mean, median, and variance. However, the function appears to have issues when dealing with certain types of input data and may not be handling exceptions properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the handling of the `NotImplementedError` exception when attempting to aggregate with certain statistical functions. The error may be causing the function to skip over relevant data and not perform the aggregation correctly.

The bug's cause appears to be related to how the function handles exceptions, specifically the `NotImplementedError`, and how it processes the data when encountering such errors.

To fix the bug, it is important to handle the `NotImplementedError` exception properly and ensure that the function can continue processing the data even if certain statistical functions are not applicable. Additionally, the aggregation process should be reviewed to ensure it is correctly handling different types of input data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            result = self._handle_alternative_aggregation(block, alt)
            if result is not no_result:
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame) and len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    # Handle split items
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                else:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = self._cast_and_downcast_data(result, block)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handle split blocks
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # Adjustment for excluded items
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, additional checks and error handling have been added to properly handle exceptions and process the data for aggregation. The function now accounts for cases where certain statistical functions are not applicable and ensures that the aggregation process continues as expected.
