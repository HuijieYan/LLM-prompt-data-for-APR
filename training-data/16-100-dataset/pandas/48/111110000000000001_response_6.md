Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the if statement where it checks if numeric_only is True. It then goes on to perform operations based on this condition.

Bug's Cause:
The potential cause of the bug in the problematic function could be due to the conditional check for numeric_only. It seems that the operations within the statement may be causing unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the get_numeric_data method and ensure it is returning the expected data.
2. Review the conditional check for numeric_only and ensure it is being used correctly.
3. Debug the function step by step to identify any unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

Corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            numeric_data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
            data = numeric_data if numeric_data is not None else data

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, I have added a check to ensure that the data obtained from get_numeric_data is not None before assigning it to the data variable. This will prevent any unexpected behavior due to None values and ensure that the data variable is correctly updated based on the numeric_only condition.
