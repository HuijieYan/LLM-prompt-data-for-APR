The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError." The issue arises when calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError when using the new nullable integer data type 'Int64'. The problem does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but occurs with median and std as well.

It appears that the potential error location within the problematic function may be in the try-except block where the error is caught. The code is attempting to handle different cases based on the dtype and the method called, and there may be a specific case involving 'Int64' that is triggering the TypeError.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the 'Int64' data type properly when trying to perform aggregation operations like mean, median, and std. This is likely due to the internal implementation not accounting for the nullable nature of 'Int64', causing a TypeError to be raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug would include:

1. Adjusting the implementation to properly handle 'Int64' data type, ensuring that aggregation operations like mean, median, and std work correctly with nullable integer data types.
2. Updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to account for the nullable nature of 'Int64' and handle aggregation operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True)

    # Perform aggregation
    agg_blocks, agg_items = data._cython_agg_general(how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
By updating the `numeric_only` check to convert the data to numeric, and calling the internal method `_cython_agg_general` to perform aggregation, we can handle the 'Int64' data type properly and resolve the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
