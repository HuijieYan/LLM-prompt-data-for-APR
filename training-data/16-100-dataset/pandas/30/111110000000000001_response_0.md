1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class. It seems to be trying to convert data to a date format, handling different data types and formats. However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation of the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different data types and formats, as well as the conditions for returning the data and the boolean value. 

3. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of data types and date formats. The function is not correctly converting data to date format and the conditions for returning the data and boolean value are not accurately implemented. Also, the function seems to be using some external variables ("self.min_stamp", "self.date_unit") which are not defined within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensure that the data type conversion is done correctly for different input formats.
   - Refactor the logic for returning the data and boolean value based on successful parsing.
   - Check for any missing definitions or dependencies required for the function to work correctly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def __init__(self, min_stamp, date_unit):
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ['ns', 'us', 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h', 'D']

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- I added an `__init__` method to the Parser class to initialize the `min_stamp` and `date_unit` attributes.
- I removed the external dependencies (`self.min_stamp`, `self.date_unit`) and replaced them with attributes of the class.
- I modified the logic for the date conversion and the conditions for returning the data and boolean value.
