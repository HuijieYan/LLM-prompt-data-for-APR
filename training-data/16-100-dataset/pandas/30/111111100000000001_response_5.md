1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is a method within the "Parser" class, which seems to be part of a larger codebase related to parsing JSON files with pandas. The function attempts to convert a data array into a date column by coercing object types into integer formats and checking for numbers that are out of range. It then attempts to convert the data into a datetime format using a specified date unit.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the "new_data" array and the checks for numbers that are out of range.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not performing the necessary checks and conversions to accurately convert the data array into a date column.
   (b). The "Parser" class may also have issues with the handling of data types and conversions, which could affect the behavior of the "_try_convert_to_date" function.
   (c). Other related functions, such as the ones used for data type conversions and datetime conversions, could also be contributing to the buggy behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement stricter checks for data types and ranges to ensure accurate conversion to date formats.
   - Improve error handling and exception handling to address any potential issues with data conversions.
   - Update the code to use more efficient and accurate methods for data type and datetime conversions.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
        
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the "new_data" array is handled more accurately, and error handling has been improved for data type conversions and datetime conversions. These changes should help to fix the bug in the original function.
