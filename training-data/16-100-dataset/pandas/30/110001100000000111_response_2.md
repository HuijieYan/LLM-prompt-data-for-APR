1. The buggy function is part of the pandas library and is used to convert data to a date column. The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of the read_json method when typ="series" is used and the input is a list of booleans. The issue is caused due to the _try_convert_to_date function incorrectly parsing boolean values as dates.

2. The potential error within the problematic function is the handling of boolean values when trying to convert data to date format.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function is attempting to convert data to date format using the to_datetime function, but it is not correctly handling boolean values.
   (b). The related functions include data type conversion functions and date parsing functions within the pandas library.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a clear example of the incorrect behavior and states the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Adding a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately from date parsing.
   (b). Modifying the logic to skip date parsing for boolean values when typ="series" is used in read_json.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        if all(isinstance(value, (int, float)) or isinstance(value, str) and value.isdigit() for value in data):
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks if the data type is "object" and whether the values are either int, float, or can be converted to int. It then uses the pd.to_datetime function to convert the data to date format, if the conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns the original data and False. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
