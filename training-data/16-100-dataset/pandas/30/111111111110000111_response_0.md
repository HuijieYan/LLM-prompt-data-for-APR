The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column, but it is currently not handling boolean values correctly, resulting in a TypeError. This function is part of the `Parser` class in the `_json.py` file in the pandas library.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON array of boolean values into a Pandas Series using the `read_json` function. The expected result is a Series of boolean values, but currently, it is throwing a TypeError due to the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible and leads to a TypeError.

The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem and the expected output, and it also mentions the inconsistency with the behavior of the `read_json` function when `typ="frame"`.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values and not try to convert them to datetime.
2. We also need to ensure that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` returns a Series of boolean values for a JSON array of boolean values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if is_bool_dtype(data):  # Check if the dtype is boolean
            return data, True  # Return the boolean values without conversion

        # Rest of the function (omitted for brevity)
```

By adding a check for boolean values and returning them without conversion, we can ensure that the function handles boolean values correctly.

With this change, the fixed `_try_convert_to_date` function should now return boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime, resolving the TypeError and passing the failing test. This change also aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
