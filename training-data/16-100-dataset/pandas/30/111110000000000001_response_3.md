1. The buggy function is a method inside the Parser class. It appears to be attempting to convert data into a date column by parsing it. The function is trying to coerce object types into epoch/iso formats and integer/float types into epoch formats. It also checks for numbers that are out of range and attempts to convert the data to a datetime format.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the new_data variable and the conversion to datetime.

3. The potential bug's cause could be related to the incorrect conversion of data types and the handling of exceptions during the conversion process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking for the data type of new_data before attempting to convert it.
   b. Implementing proper error handling and logging to identify the root cause of any conversion errors.
   c. Ensuring that the input data is in the expected format before attempting any conversions.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    
    # Fixed and corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

        Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the function has been updated to properly handle the conversion of data types and the handling of exceptions during the conversion process. Correct method calls have been implemented, and the checks for the data type and range have been improved for accuracy.
