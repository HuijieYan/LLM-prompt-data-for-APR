The issue seems to be related to parsing a list of booleans into a Series with the `read_json` function in Pandas. The expected behavior is to return a Series of boolean values, but instead, it results in a Series of timestamps in older Pandas versions and raises a TypeError in the newer Pandas version.

The problem seems to be related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file, as it is responsible for parsing the input data into a date column.

Upon analyzing the function and the related GitHub issue, it seems that the issue occurs when the input data is of type `bool`. The function tries to convert the boolean data into a timestamp, which leads to the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean input separately and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them into timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this modification, the function will now return the input data as is if it is of type `bool`, preventing it from being incorrectly converted into timestamps. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
