1. The buggy function is part of a class called Parser. It is attempting to convert a given data into a date column by parsing ndarray-like data. It checks for data type, then tries to convert it to int64, and finally attempts to convert it to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for converting data to int64 and then to datetime. Additionally, there is a reference to self.min_stamp and self.date_unit, which are not defined within the function.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to convert data into a date column, but it is not handling all possible data types, and there are references to variables that are not defined within the function.
   (b) The buggy class is missing some necessary attributes or methods that are being referenced within the buggy function, such as self.min_stamp and self.date_unit.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Defining the missing attributes or methods within the class, such as self.min_stamp and self.date_unit.
   - Handling all possible data types and edge cases when converting data to int64 and datetime.
   - Refactoring the logic for converting data to int64 and datetime to ensure proper conversion.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)  # assuming self.min_stamp is defined
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns', 'ps', 'fs', 'as')
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, I have added a default tuple of date units if self.date_unit is not defined. I have also made assumptions about the definition of self.min_stamp, but it should be defined within the class. Additionally, I have updated the logic for checking in_range and added appropriate exception handling for converting to datetime.
