1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the class `Parser`. It is part of the `pandas.io.json` module and is used to try to parse an ndarray into a date column. The error arises when trying to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. This results in a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it is trying to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

3. The bug's cause arises from the function's attempt to convert boolean values to datetime. This behavior is not consistent with the expectations of the users, and it leads to an error when trying to read JSON data with `typ="series"`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the data types before attempting to convert them to datetime. If the data type is boolean, it should not be converted to datetime. Additionally, handling boolean values separately to ensure that the series is correctly returned as a series of booleans rather than trying to convert them to datetime.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.missing import isna, iNaT
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray into a date column.
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore boolean values and only handle numerical data types
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        else:
            return data, False

        return new_data, True
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the data type is boolean and returns the original data if it is. If the data type is numerical, it proceeds with the rest of the parsing logic. This ensures that boolean values are not mistakenly converted to datetime and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
