The bug seems to be related to the conversion of a list of booleans to a Pandas Series object using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`. The error message indicates that a boolean is not convertible to datetime, which implies that there is an issue with the conversion logic within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The failing test provides a specific case where the function fails, and the GitHub issue further clarifies the expected behavior and the observed problem.

The potential error location within the `_try_convert_to_date` function is likely in the conversion logic for non-datetime types. The code attempts to convert the input data to datetime without explicitly checking if it is of the correct type.

To fix the bug, the conversion logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be updated to handle boolean values correctly. Additionally, the handling of non-datetime types in the function should be improved to ensure that the function returns the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtypes == bool:
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to handle boolean values appropriately, returning the value as it is and marking the conversion as unsuccessful. Additionally, we have used `pd.to_datetime` instead of `to_datetime` to ensure consistency and proper conversion of the data.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
