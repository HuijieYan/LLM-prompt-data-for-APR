The bug in the function is caused by the fact that the variable `new_data` is not being updated correctly. Instead of updating it in place, a new variable should be created and assigned the updated value.

The issue reported on GitHub is related to reading a JSON file with boolean values as a pandas Series. The expected output would be a Series of boolean values, but in older versions of pandas, it results in a Series of timestamps. Since version 1.0.0, it raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the conversion of the input data to a date column. It should also address the reported issue on GitHub by ensuring that when reading a JSON file with boolean values as a pandas Series, the output is indeed a Series of boolean values.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data)
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if is_datetime(new_data) or issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            new_data > self.min_stamp
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code should fix the bug by handling the data conversion properly and should also address the issue reported on GitHub by returning a Series of boolean values when reading a JSON file with boolean values as a pandas Series.
