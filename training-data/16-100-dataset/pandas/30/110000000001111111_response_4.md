The potential error in the function lies in the logic that processes the date conversion. It seems to be incorrectly identifying boolean values as dates, where it should just return the original data as it is.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking and coercing object types to dates is incorrect, leading to the incorrect parsing of boolean values as dates. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where a list of boolean values is incorrectly converted to date timestamps.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly identify and handle boolean values as a special case and return the original data unchanged.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, False

    if (isinstance(data, int) or isinstance(data, float)) and data < self.min_stamp:
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, list):
        data = np.array(data)

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for boolean values and returns the original data, and also correctly converts other data types to datetime if possible. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and address the issue posted in the GitHub report.
