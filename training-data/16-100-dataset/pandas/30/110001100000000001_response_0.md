1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column. It checks for different date formats and attempts to convert the data to a datetime format. However, there are several potential issues within the function, such as handling the data type and checking for in-range values.

2. The potential error locations within the function include:
   - Handling the data type check for "object" type
   - Checking for in-range values of numeric data
   - Error handling and exception catching during the conversion process

3. The bug's cause may be related to incorrect handling of data types and exception handling. The function should properly handle the conversion of "object" type to "int64", as well as properly checking for in-range values of numeric data. Additionally, the error handling during the conversion process might not be thorough enough, leading to unexpected exceptions and failure in parsing the data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly handle the data type conversion from "object" to "int64"
   - Implement thorough error handling during the conversion process
   - Improve the in-range value checking for numeric data
   - Ensure that the function can handle different date units and formats effectively

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    for date_unit in [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the data type conversion and in-range value checking has been improved. The function now properly handles the conversion of "object" type to "int64" and checks for in-range values of numeric data. Additionally, the error handling during the conversion process has been enhanced to ensure that the function can handle different date units and formats effectively.
