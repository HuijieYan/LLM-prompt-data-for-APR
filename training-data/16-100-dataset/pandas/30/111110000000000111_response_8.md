1. The buggy function is part of a class called Parser, which seems to be related to parsing and converting data into a date format. The GitHub issue is related to reading json with typ="series" of json list of bools resulting in timestamps/Exception, which seems to be related to date conversion issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for converting data into date formats, as well as handling boolean values.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is attempting to convert data into date formats, but it seems to be causing issues with boolean values.
   (b). The class might be incorrectly handling the conversion of boolean values to dates.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that the problem arises when trying to read JSON with typ="series" of JSON list of bools, which results in timestamps or exceptions instead of a series of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Validate the data and handle boolean values separately from date conversions.
   - Update the logic for handling different data types, including booleans.
   - Test the function with various input data types to ensure it handles them correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif data.dtype == "bool":  # handle boolean values separately
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return data, True
        return data, False
```

The corrected code includes a separate handling for boolean values and ensures that they do not go through the date conversion process. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub problem description.
