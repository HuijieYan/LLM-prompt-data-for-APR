The buggy function is _try_convert_to_date, which is part of the Parser class. This function is trying to convert input data into a date column and is encountering an error when the input data contains boolean values.

The failing test is trying to read a JSON containing boolean values as a series, but it is encountering a TypeError because the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible.

The bug is caused by the _try_convert_to_date function not handling boolean values properly and trying to convert them to datetime.

To fix the bug, the _try_convert_to_date function needs to check for boolean values and handle them differently than other data types. It should return the boolean values as they are, without attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object" and (data.str.contains("-") | data.str.contains(":")).all():
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, False
```

This corrected function now properly handles boolean values and returns them as they are, without trying to convert them to datetime. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
