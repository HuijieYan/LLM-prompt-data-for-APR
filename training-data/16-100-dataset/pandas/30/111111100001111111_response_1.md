The issue here seems to be that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not correctly handling boolean values, and is instead trying to convert them into timestamps. This is causing inconsistent behavior for the `read_json` function, with `typ="series"`.

The root cause of the issue is the check for the data type being "object" and then attempting to convert it to an "int64". This is likely incorrect for boolean data, as it should not be converted to an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary conversion of boolean values and handle them separately. We can also simplify the logic for handling the date conversion for different date units.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data

    # handle boolean data separately
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should handle boolean data correctly and avoid unnecessary conversions to int64. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub, and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
