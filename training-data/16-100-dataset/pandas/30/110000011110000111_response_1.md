The bug in the provided function `_try_convert_to_date` is due to the fact that the function is trying to parse a boolean input as a date, which is resulting in a TypeError. This is causing the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` to raise an exception while trying to covert a boolean to a datetime.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the boolean type is not convertible to datetime, which is consistent with the behavior of the buggy function.

The GitHub issue also confirms the problem, stating that the expected output from `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")` should be a Series of bools, but instead it is either raising an exception or creating a Series of timestamps.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to check for boolean types and handle them separately from datetime conversion. If the input data is a boolean, it should directly return the data with a boolean flag set to True, indicating successful conversion.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_try_convert_to_date`:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # handle boolean input separately
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
