The bug in the provided function is causing boolean values to be incorrectly converted to datetime objects, resulting in a TypeError. This is not the expected behavior, as users would expect a Series of bools and not an exception or a series of timestamps.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the `_try_convert_to_date` function, where it is incorrectly converting boolean values to datetime objects.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle boolean values correctly. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle boolean values and not attempt to convert them to datetime objects, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
