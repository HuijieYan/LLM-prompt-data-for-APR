The bug in the provided function is likely causing the incorrect conversion of boolean values to timestamps, as described in the GitHub issue. The function is attempting to convert the input data into a date column, but it should be checking for boolean values and handling them differently. This is likely causing the unexpected behavior when trying to convert a Series of boolean values into timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for boolean values and handle them accordingly, rather than attempting to convert them into date values. Additionally, it should return the correct data type based on the input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False
        
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With these changes, the function now checks for boolean values and returns them without attempting to convert them to date values. The function also handles numeric values and datetime conversions as before.

This should address the issue described in the GitHub issue and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
