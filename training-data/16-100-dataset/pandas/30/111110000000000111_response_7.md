1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class, which attempts to convert data into a date column. The GitHub issue is related to using the read_json function with typ="series" of a json list of bools, which results in timestamps or an exception instead of a Pandas Series of bools. The issue is that the _try_convert_to_date function is not handling boolean data correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it checks for the dtype of the data and attempts to handle it as an integer.

3. The bug's cause includes:
   (a). The _try_convert_to_date function is trying to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, but it is not handling boolean data correctly.
   (b). The Parser class may also have issues with handling different data types when converting to date.

   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that when using the read_json function with typ="series" of a json list of bools, it results in timestamps or an exception instead of a Pandas Series of bools. This aligns with the fact that the _try_convert_to_date function is not correctly handling boolean data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Update the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean data appropriately, returning a boolean if parsing was successful.
   (b). Review the Parser class and ensure that it can handle different data types when converting to date.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data.astype("bool"), True

        return new_data, True
```

In this corrected code, the _try_convert_to_date function checks for boolean data and handles it appropriately, returning a boolean if parsing was successful. It also uses the pd.to_datetime function to convert object data into dates.
