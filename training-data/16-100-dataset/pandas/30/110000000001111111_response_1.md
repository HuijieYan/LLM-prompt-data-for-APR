The problem arises in the `_try_convert_to_date` function when it attempts to convert data to a date column. The function is currently trying to convert boolean values to a date, which causes the errors and unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the function is also trying to convert `RangeIndex` values, which are not intended to be converted to a date column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle boolean and `RangeIndex` values differently and handle them appropriately.

Based on the provided information, here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # return the original data if it's already in bool type

    elif isinstance(data, pd.RangeIndex):
        return data, False  # return the original data if it's a RangeIndex

    else:
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes specific handling for `pd.Series` of boolean and `pd.RangeIndex` types, returning the original data and `False`. For other data types, the function attempts to convert them to `datetime` values as before.

With these changes, the function should now return the expected output for the described test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
