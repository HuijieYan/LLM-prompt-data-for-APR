1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible. This function is being called by the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`, which is attempting to convert a list of boolean values into a pandas series.

2. The potential error location is within the `to_datetime` function call in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, where it tries to convert the boolean values to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is that the `to_datetime` function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not allowed. This is evident from the error message which states that `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime.

4. To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them to datetime. One approach for fixing the bug would be to check the data type of the input data and return boolean values as is, without attempting to convert them to datetime.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":  # handle boolean values separately
        return data, False

    # rest of the code for conversion to datetime
```

With this corrected code, boolean values will be handled separately and not be passed to the `to_datetime` function, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
