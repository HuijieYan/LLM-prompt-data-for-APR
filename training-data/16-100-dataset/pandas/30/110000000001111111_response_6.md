The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how it handles converting boolean values to timestamps, which is causing the incorrect output mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the conversion logic, where it incorrectly handles boolean values, leading to the unexpected output of timestamps and causing a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

The bug's cause is that the function is trying to convert boolean values into timestamps, which is not the expected behavior when the input is a series of boolean values. This is causing the unexpected output and the TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Adding a condition to check if the input data is of boolean type and handle it appropriately without attempting to convert it to timestamps.
2. Ensuring that the function only attempts to convert data to timestamps if it is in a format that can be validly parsed as a date.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT))
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    # Skip conversion of boolean type data
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a condition to skip conversion of boolean type data and ensures that only appropriate data is being converted to timestamps, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
