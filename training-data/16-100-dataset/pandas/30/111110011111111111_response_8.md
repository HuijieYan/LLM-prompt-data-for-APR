The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. The function attempts to convert data to a date column, but it currently has several issues that cause it to fail the test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code that attempts to parse the new_data as a date using the `to_datetime` function.

The cause of the bug can be found by analyzing the function, the failing test, and the error message. The function currently does not check for boolean data when trying to convert to a date, causing it to raise a TypeError when encountering boolean values. This is evident from the error message which indicates that `<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`. Additionally, the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value further confirms that the function is not handling boolean data properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include a check for boolean data before attempting to convert to a date using the `to_datetime` function. Additionally, it should return the new_data along with the correct boolean value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
