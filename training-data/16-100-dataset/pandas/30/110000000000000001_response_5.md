1. The buggy function is supposed to parse an ndarray into a date column, coercing object data in epoch/iso formats and integer/float data in epoch formats. However, there are a few issues with the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location is within the if statement that checks if the data type is "object", as well as the subsequent loop that tries to convert the data to datetime using different units.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the conversion of data to a date column correctly, and it does not return the output in some cases where it should.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the data type conversion logic to ensure it is working as intended
   - Making sure that the function returns the correct output in all cases

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else ('ns', 'us', 'ms', 's', 'D', 'M', 'Y')
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the data type conversion logic is fixed to handle "object" data correctly, and the function now returns the correct output in all cases. Additionally, the code now uses the correct function names for checking for NaN values and converting to datetime.
