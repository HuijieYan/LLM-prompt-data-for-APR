The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that tries to convert data to a date format. It seems that the function is incorrectly converting boolean data to a date format, which is not the expected behavior.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling boolean data when trying to convert it to a date format, leading to unexpected behavior and an error.

To fix this bug, the function needs to first check the type of the data it receives and handle boolean data differently than date data. It should also handle the conversion of boolean data to ensure that it remains as boolean data and is not mistakenly converted to a date format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # don't convert boolean data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code will handle boolean data separately from date data, ensuring that boolean data is not mistakenly converted to a date format. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by correctly returning a Series of boolean values when using `pd.read_json` with `typ='series'`.
