The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it's incorrectly converting non-datetime data into datetime data, resulting in unexpected behavior. This is causing exceptions to be raised in some cases and returning incorrect data in others.

The bug's cause is related to incorrect handling of non-datetime data and failing to return the original data when it cannot be converted to a date.

To fix the bug, the function should check the data type and only attempt to convert if it is of datetime type. If it is not, the function should return the original data. Additionally, the in_range check logic should be modified to accurately identify data that is out of range and create a boolean array based on that.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if hasattr(data, 'dtype') and data.dtype.name.startswith('datetime'):
            return data, False

        in_range = (
            isna(data)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the data passed to it is already in datetime format. If it is, it simply returns the original data. If not, it checks if the data is within range or not, and then attempts to convert it into a datetime if it is within range. If the conversion fails, it returns the original data. This corrected function should resolve the issues described in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
