The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert the input data to a date column, but it incorrectly handles boolean input, resulting in a TypeError when attempting to convert boolean values to datetime objects.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle boolean input correctly, and tries to convert it to datetime objects, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should check for boolean input and handle it separately. Additionally, the function should return the converted data when the conversion is successful.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a pandas Series into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='raise')
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected function should handle boolean input correctly, and for other input types, it uses the `pd.to_datetime` function to convert the data to datetime objects and returns the result together with a boolean flag indicating if the conversion was successful.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
