1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class, which is responsible for trying to convert data into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, and if not, it tries to coerce the data into an integer type. It then checks if the numbers are within a certain range, and finally tries to convert the data into a datetime object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the try-except block where it tries to coerce the data into an integer type. If this conversion fails, it simply passes and continues to the next step without handling the error.

3. The cause of the bug is that if the data cannot be coerced into an integer type, the function does not handle the error and simply moves on. This might lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add proper error handling for the try-except block where it tries to coerce the data into an integer type.
   - Check for the success of the coercion and only proceed if it was successful.
   - Ensure that all potential error scenarios are handled properly to avoid unexpected behavior.

5. Here is the corrected code with added error handling:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError) as e: # Added error handling
                return data, False

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, error handling has been added to the try-except block where it tries to coerce the data into an integer type. If the coercion fails, it returns data and False, indicating that the parsing was not successful. This ensures that the function handles potential errors and provides more reliable results.
