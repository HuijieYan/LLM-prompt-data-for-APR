The problem appears to be caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly converting input data to dates, resulting in unexpected output when reading JSON with `typ="series"`.

The expected behavior is that when using `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")`, the function should return a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it results in timestamps or an exception in older Pandas versions, and a TypeError in newer versions.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it attempts to convert the data to datetime. This is evident from the fact that the expected output should be a Series of bools, and the issue is related to unexpected timestamp conversion behavior.

To resolve the issue, the function needs to handle boolean data separately and return a Series of bools, rather than attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(data):
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the input data is a Series of bools, and if so, it returns the original data with a boolean flag, indicating that the conversion was successful. Otherwise, it returns the original data with a False flag.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function behaves as expected for JSON input with `typ="series"`.
