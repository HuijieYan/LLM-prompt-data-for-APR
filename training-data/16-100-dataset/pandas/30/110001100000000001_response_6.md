1. The buggy function is meant to try and convert an ndarray into a date column by parsing it into different date formats. It makes use of various related functions such as isna, to_datetime, and dtype.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be within the conditional statements that check for the dtype and the range of the data.

3. (a). The buggy function appears to have issues with handling the conversion of data into date formats, especially when dealing with different date units and error handling.
   (b). The related functions such as isna, to_datetime, and dtype are being used to handle type conversion, checking for NaN values, and converting data into datetime objects.

4. To fix the bug, it may be necessary to ensure that the conversion of data into date formats is handled correctly, and the conditional statements are properly structured to account for different scenarios. Additionally, error handling should be improved to catch any potential issues during the conversion process.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaT
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/is formats, and integer/float in epoch
    formats.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the function `to_datetime` is called with the correct parameters, and the error handling is improved to handle potential conversion issues. The conditional statements are adjusted to properly account for different scenarios, and variable names are updated for clarity.
