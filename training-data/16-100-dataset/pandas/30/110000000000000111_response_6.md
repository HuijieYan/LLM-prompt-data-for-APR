1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is used to parse a ndarray into a date column, but it seems to be converting boolean values into timestamps instead of returning a Series of bools. This is related to the GitHub issue because it mentions an unexpected output of a Pandas Series of timestamps when the expected output should be a Series of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the part where it is trying to convert boolean values into timestamps instead of recognizing them as boolean values.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling boolean values and is trying to convert them into timestamps instead of recognizing them as bools. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user expects a Series of bools but is getting timestamps instead.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle boolean values and return a Series of bools instead of trying to convert them into timestamps.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == bool:
        return data, True  # return the data as it is with True for successful parsing

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, boolean values are specifically handled and returned as they are, with the parsing result set to True. This should ensure that the function returns a Series of bools for boolean inputs.
