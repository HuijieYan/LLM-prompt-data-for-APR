1. The buggy function is trying to convert a column of data into a date column by parsing date formats such as epoch and ISO formats and handling integer and float values representing epoch formats. It also checks if the numbers are within a valid range. It uses related functions like `astype`, `to_datetime`, `isna`, and `iNaT`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `if new_data.dtype == "object":` block, where it tries to convert the data to int64.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the improper handling of the conversion of data to int64. This can lead to potential errors when trying to parse the data as a date using the `to_datetime` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if the conversion to int64 was successful before attempting to parse the data as a date.
   - Handling any errors that occur during the conversion and parsing process.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas import NaT as iNaT
from pandas.errors import AbstractMethodError
from pandas.util._exceptions import OutOfBoundsDatetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
        in_range = (
            np.isnat(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype('M8[ns]', copy=False, errors='raise')
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, AbstractMethodError, OutOfBoundsDatetime):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the use of `np.isnat` is used to check for NaT (Not a Time) values, and the conversion to int64 is handled more robustly. Also, the `astype` function is explicitly used to convert the data to 'M8[ns]' format. Additionally, the error handling has been improved to catch more potential exceptions.
