1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is meant to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column, coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the handling of data with dtype "object" and the subsequent conversion to int64, as well as the handling of date units and the conversion to datetime.

3. The bug's cause could be related to improper handling of data with dtype "object" and the date units when converting to datetime. The try-except blocks for converting data to int64 and datetime may not be handling all potential errors properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Proper error handling for the conversion of data to int64 and datetime, ensuring that all potential errors are caught and handled appropriately.
   - Checking the data type and date units more rigorously to ensure proper conversion to datetime.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

class BuggyClass:
    def __init__(self, date_unit=None, min_stamp=None):
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ["ns", "us", "ms", "s"]

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have made sure to handle the errors in converting the data to int64 and datetime more effectively. We also added proper error handling for potential errors in the conversion process. Additionally, we have properly checked for the data type and date units to ensure proper conversion to datetime.
