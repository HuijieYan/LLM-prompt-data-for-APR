The issue in the buggy function appears to be that it is incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to dates, leading to the `TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime` error. This error is being triggered by the `to_datetime` function call, indicating that the boolean values are being incorrectly interpreted as dates.

The `new_data.dtype == "object"` condition in the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempts to convert the data to "int64" dtype if it is of type "object". This is not the correct approach for boolean data, and is likely causing the erroneous conversion to dates. Additionally, the function does not handle boolean data specifically, which results in the inappropriate behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to correctly handle boolean data, and avoid attempting to convert them to dates. It should also return the new_data and the status separately.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False
        
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        return new_data, True
```

The corrected function now checks for boolean data and immediately returns the input data with a status of False, to indicate that the data was not converted to dates. For other data types, it retains the previous behavior of attempting to convert them to int64, and returning a status of True if successful.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle boolean data and avoid the erroneous conversion to dates, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
