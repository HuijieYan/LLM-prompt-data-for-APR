1. The buggy function is a part of the Parser class. The function is supposed to try to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. It should return a boolean indicating if parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of date parsing and converting data types.

3. The bug's cause may be due to improper handling of date parsing and conversion of data types within the function. Additionally, the function may not be handling exceptions properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensure proper exception handling for date parsing and data type conversion.
   - Check for any logical errors in the code that may lead to incorrect results.
   - Use appropriate methods for date parsing and type conversion to ensure accurate results.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the `pd` module is used for methods such as `pd.to_numeric` and `pd.to_datetime` instead of direct calls. Proper exception handling is implemented for date parsing and data type conversion. Additionally, logical errors have been reviewed and fixed to ensure accurate results.
