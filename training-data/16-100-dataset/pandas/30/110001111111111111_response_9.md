The error is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is incorrect. This can be resolved by checking the data type of the input before performing any conversion operations.

To fix the bug, update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to explicitly handle boolean values and return a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if data.dtype == bool:  # Checking if the data type is boolean
        return data, False
    else:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

With this update, the function will properly handle boolean values and return a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and the corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
