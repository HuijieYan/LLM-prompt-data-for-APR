1. The buggy function is a part of the TimeGrouper class in the pandas library, which is used for time-interval grouping. It is related to other functions within the same file, such as _adjust_bin_edges, as well as other classes and functions in the pandas library. The GitHub issue refers to a problem with the groupby function failing with AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba, which is related to the behavior of the _get_time_bins function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the manipulation of time intervals and date ranges, particularly when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to time zone changes.

3. Elucidation of the bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function _get_time_bins is responsible for creating time bins based on the provided axis.
   (b). The TimeGrouper class is meant to handle time-interval grouping, and the _get_time_bins function is a crucial part of this process.
   (c). Other related functions, such as _adjust_bin_edges, are used within _get_time_bins to manipulate date ranges and intervals.
   (d). The GitHub issue describes a problem with the groupby function failing on a clock change day in Cuba due to ambiguous timestamps, which is likely related to the behavior of _get_time_bins when handling date ranges and time intervals.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly, taking into account the time zone changes and potential inconsistencies in the date ranges.
   - Use specific time zone handling functions or libraries to address the ambiguity in timestamps caused by time zone changes.
   - Ensure that the date range and time interval calculations within _get_time_bins consider potential ambiguities and edge cases related to time zone changes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code takes into account potential ambiguities in timestamps due to time zone changes, ensuring that the date range and time interval calculations within the _get_time_bins function handle these scenarios appropriately.
