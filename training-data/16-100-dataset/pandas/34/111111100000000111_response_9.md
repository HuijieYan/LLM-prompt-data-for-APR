1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper` in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. This function is responsible for grouping time intervals but is failing on clock change days due to an AmbiguousTimeError. The class `TimeGrouper` also contains the method `_adjust_bin_edges`, which is called within the buggy function.

The GitHub issue relates to a specific example where the groupby with daily frequency fails on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of the bin edges using the `date_range` function. This could be causing the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` attempts to calculate bin edges for time intervals.
   (b). The class `TimeGrouper` is responsible for custom time-interval grouping.
   (c). The related functions include `ax`, `_adjust_bin_edges`, and `_get_timestamp_range_edges`.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information details a specific example of the bug occurring on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError on groupby with daily frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include handling AmbiguousTimeError cases in the `_get_time_bins` function, adjusting the calculation of bin edges to account for ambiguous timestamps, or modifying the logic for creating bin edges to avoid the error.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments to the calculation of bin edges, addressing the potential causes of the AmbiguousTimeError. It should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
