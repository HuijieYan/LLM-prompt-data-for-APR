1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called by the `groupby` method as part of the resampling logic. The function uses the `date_range` function to generate time bins, and the failing test is related to resampling with a daily frequency in a timezone with a daylight saving time transition.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the generation of time bins using the `date_range` function, especially when dealing with timezone transitions and ambiguous times.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process. The failing test is triggered by a specific scenario involving a clock change in the "America/Havana" timezone, and the error message indicates an "AmbiguousTimeError" related to inferring the daylight saving time. The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the specific problem and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous times and daylight saving time transitions specifically in the `_get_time_bins` function.
   - Ensuring that the resampling logic takes into account timezone transitions and ambiguous times.

5. Code for the corrected function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    freq = to_offset(self.freq)
    tz = ax.tz
    ambiguity = "infer" if tz is not None else None
    binner = date_range(start=first.floor(freq), end=last.floor(freq) + freq, freq=self.freq, tz=tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous=ambiguity)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles timezone transitions, ambiguous times, and daylight saving time specifically in the process of generating time bins for resampling. It ensures that the resampling logic takes into account the specific scenario described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
