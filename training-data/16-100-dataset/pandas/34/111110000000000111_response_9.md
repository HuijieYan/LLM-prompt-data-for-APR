1. The function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the class `TimeGrouper`, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with the `pd.Grouper` function failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue is caused by the failure of `pd.Grouper` to handle ambiguous timestamps on long clock-change days, which relates to the grouping of timestamps based on frequency.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the handling of timestamps and time bins, as well as the adjustment of bin edges using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The problematic function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class is designed for custom time-interval grouping and utilizes the `_get_time_bins` function to generate time bins for grouping.
   (c). The GitHub issue information describes how the `pd.Grouper` fails to handle ambiguous timestamps on long clock-change days in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for generating time bins and adjusting bin edges to handle ambiguous timestamps and long clock-change days, possibly by handling timezone conversions and ambiguous timestamps more robustly.
   - Implement additional checks and error handling within the `_get_time_bins` function to prevent the occurrence of the AmbiguousTimeError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code aims to address the potential issues with handling ambiguous timestamps and time bins, ensuring that the `pd.Grouper` function can handle timestamps on long clock-change days in Cuba without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.
