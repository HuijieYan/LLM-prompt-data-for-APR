The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a discrepancy with the handling of time intervals during a clock change day in Cuba. This is due to a possible issue in the `bin_edges` calculation and the generation of `labels` and `binner`. 

The specific problem seems to be the way the `bin_edges` are calculated and used to generate the `labels` and `binner`. There is also an issue with the parsing and generating of the timestamp range edges in the `first` and `last` variables.

To fix the bug, the generation of `bin_edges`, `labels`, and `binner` needs to be revised in order to correctly handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change on the specific day. 

The corrected code for the function `_get_time_bins` is shown below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    last = ax.max().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + pd.Timedelta("1D")

    bin_edges = np.r_[first, pd.date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )]

    binner = labels = bin_edges[:-1]

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
With this corrected function, the `AmbiguousTimeError` should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test. This resolves the issue as described in the GitHub bug report.
