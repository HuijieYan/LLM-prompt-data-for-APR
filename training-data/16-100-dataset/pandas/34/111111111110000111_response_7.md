1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function attempts to group datetime data using a time frequency, but it fails when dealing with ambiguous time from daylight saving time. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to an issue at the time change during grouping.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is during the creation of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, which does not handle daylight saving time or ambiguous time properly.

3. The buggy function tries to create bins and labels for time grouping, but it fails to handle ambiguous time caused by daylight saving time. This is likely due to the inconsistency in handling time intervals and daylight saving time. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to group data with an ambiguous time resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the daylight saving time issue. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Improving the handling of ambiguous time and daylight saving time in the function.
   (b) Ensuring proper conversion of time zones and handling ambiguous time in the grouping process.
   (c) Addressing the inconsistency in handling time intervals and daylight saving time within the function.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the issue identified:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}")
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), to_offset(self.freq), closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=to_offset(self.freq),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = binner.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous time and daylight saving time issue, allowing the function to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
