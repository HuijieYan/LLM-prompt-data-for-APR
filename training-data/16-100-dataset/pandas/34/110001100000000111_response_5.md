1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `pandas.core.resample` module, which is related to the issue raised on GitHub. The issue is related to the grouping behavior of the `pd.Grouper` when faced with ambiguous time stamps, such as during a clock change day in a particular time zone.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `binner` and `bin_edges` in the `_get_time_bins` function. This is where the grouping behavior is being determined, and it seems to be causing the AmbiguousTimeError when faced with ambiguous time stamps.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling ambiguous time stamps properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The problematic function is responsible for determining the bins and labels for grouping based on time frequency. In the GitHub issue, this behavior is expected to group the data correctly, taking into account the ambiguity in time stamps during a clock change day.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Implementing a check for ambiguous time stamps and handling them appropriately within the `_get_time_bins` function.
   b. Utilizing the functionalities of the `pd.Grouper` class to correctly handle ambiguous time stamps when creating bins and labels.
   c. Ensuring that the frequency and time zone information are properly accounted for when creating the bins and labels.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, handling ambiguous time stamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans,
        ambiguous='legacy',  # Handling ambiguous time stamps
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we have added the handling of ambiguous time stamps by setting the `ambiguous` parameter to 'legacy' when generating bins using `lib.generate_bins_dt64`. This change ensures that ambiguous time stamps are handled appropriately, which should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
