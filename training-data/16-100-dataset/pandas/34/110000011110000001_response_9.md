1. The function _get_time_bins is supposed to create time bins for resampling a time series. The failing test is trying to downsample a time series with a frequency of 1H to 1D. The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised, which suggests that there is an issue with handling daylight savings time or duplicate time values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the date_range function call, where it is being used to create time bins.

3. The bug's cause seems to be the handling of ambiguous time values during the creation of time bins. This is causing the AmbiguousTimeError to be raised when downsampling the time series.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include explicitly handling ambiguous time values during the creation of time bins, ensuring that daylight savings time transitions are properly accounted for, and possibly adjusting the frequency of the time bins to avoid ambiguous time values.

5. Here is the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, DataFrame, NaT
import pandas as pd

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by using NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = pd.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated code includes changes in the date_range call to handle ambiguous times by using NaT. This should address the AmbiguousTimeError issue when running the failing test.
