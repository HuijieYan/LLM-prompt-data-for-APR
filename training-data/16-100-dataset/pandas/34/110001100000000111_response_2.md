1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of a class, as it references `self`. It is expected to take a `DatetimeIndex` object `ax` as input and return `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` based on the calculations performed within the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be around the usage of `date_range` and the handling of time zones, as the GitHub issue mentions an AmbiguousTimeError related to a clock change day in Cuba.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zones within the `_get_time_bins` function, leading to the erroneous grouping behavior described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps and time zones more effectively within the `_get_time_bins` function.
   - Ensuring that the `date_range` and related operations within the function account for ambiguous times and time zone changes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.resample import DatetimeIndex, date_range
import numpy as np
from pandas import NaT
from pandas.core import lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    ).asi8
    bin_edges = np.append(bin_edges, [bin_edges[-1] + np.timedelta64(1, 'ms')])

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bin_edges, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues related to handling ambiguous timestamps and time zones within the `_get_time_bins` function. The usage of `date_range` and bin edges calculation has been adjusted to account for potential time zone and ambiguity issues. This should help in resolving the grouping problem described in the GitHub issue.
