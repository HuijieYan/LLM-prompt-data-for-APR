1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The function's purpose is to collect time bins based on the input axis. It calls the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function and the `_adjust_bin_edges` function from the same file but different classes.

The GitHub issue is related to a problem with daily frequency groupby, especially on clock change days in Cuba, which results in an AmbiguousTimeError. This is likely related to the way time bins are being generated by the `_get_time_bins` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation and adjustment of time bins, especially around time zones and ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, and potential issues with time zone handling or ambiguous timestamps might be originating from this class.
   (c). The `related functions` such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are called within the `_get_time_bins` function and might also play a role in the bug.
   (d). The GitHub issue information highlights the specific problem on clock change days in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when using the `pd.Grouper` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
   - Improved handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function.
   - Validation of time bin generation and adjustment, especially on clock change days.
   - Enhancing the `_adjust_bin_edges` function to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses potential issues related to time bins, handling of time zones, and ambiguous timestamps, aiming to resolve the specific problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
