The issue arises from the use of ambiguous time during a clock change in Cuba. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` does not handle this properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group by `'1D'` frequency.

The bug occurs in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is called by the `groupby` function of the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for creating time bins and labels for the grouping operation.

The expected output should be three groups for each day from November 3rd to November 5th, with the group for November 4th labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing 25 hourly data points.

Based on the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be due to incorrect handling of the ambiguous time during the clock change in Cuba. The function does not properly adjust for the ambiguous time, leading to an error.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. This can be achieved by adjusting the labels and bins to account for the ambiguous time, and ensuring that the grouping is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # handle ambiguous time during clock change
    binner = ax.floor(self.freq)
    labels = binner
    if self.label == 'right':
        labels = binner + self.freq

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle the ambiguous time properly and not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing the `groupby` operation with a daily frequency on the provided dataset.
