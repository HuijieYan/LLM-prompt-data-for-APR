The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to return binned indices, bins, and labels based on the input of a DatetimeIndex ax. The code appears to be targeting inconsistent bin generation.

The issue is likely related to how the timestamp range edges are being calculated and applied, resulting in miscalculated bins and labels. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the adjustment of bin edges based on the input DatetimeIndex ax.

To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the calculation and usage of the timestamp range edges, ensuring that the calculation properly considers the timezone information and frequency.
2. Review the adjustments made to the bin edges and ensure that they are accurate and correctly aligned with the input ax.
3. Verify the generation of bins and labels based on the adjusted timestamp range edges and bin edges.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import NaT, DatetimeIndex, date_range
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    if self.closed == 'right':
        last += 1
    else:
        last -= 1

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed=='right')
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function should now generate accurate bins and labels based on the input DatetimeIndex ax, along with properly adjusted bin edges. Note that the exact adjustment for bin_edges was not provided, so further details on this adjustment may be necessary for a precise correction.
