The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the handling of the transition from standard time to daylight saving time (DST) on November 4th, 2018 in the timezone 'America/Havana'. This transition leads to an ambiguous timestamp at midnight, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` operation is performed.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function in the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the transition from standard time to DST on November 4th, 2018. This results in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing the grouping operation.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamp on the transition day. The `date_range` function needs to be modified to generate the range while considering the ambiguous time.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle the ambiguous time explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function. This can be achieved by setting the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to a value that resolves the ambiguous time issue. Additionally, the `nonexistent` parameter should also be handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Generate range while considering ambiguous time and nonexistent time
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle nonexistent time
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the `date_range` function handles the ambiguous timestamp caused by the transition from standard time to DST, and the `nonexistent` parameter is handled appropriately.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug regarding the `AmbiguousTimeError` when performing the grouping operation with a daily frequency on the transition day to DST in the 'America/Havana' timezone.
