The bug in the provided function seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. It seems that the bug is causing an AmbiguousTimeError, as reported in the GitHub issue. 

The problematic function is `_get_time_bins(self, ax)`, which is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the timestamps on clock change days, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the bins and labels for time grouping. This seems to be related to the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps, as well as the adjustment and generation of bins and labels.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to properly handle the ambiguous timestamps, taking into account the timezone changes on clock change days in Cuba. Additionally, proper handling of the bins and labels adjustment and generation should be ensured.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
  
    # Use tz_localize to handle ambiguous timestamps
    first = ax[0].tz_localize(None)
    last = ax[-1].tz_localize(None) + pd.Timedelta("1H")

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resolving the issue reported on the GitHub. This change should help the function to produce the expected output, providing the correct grouping on clock change days in Cuba.
