The potential error in the buggy function lies in the calculation of the `bin_edges` and `bins`. It seems that the bin edges are not being calculated correctly, which is causing incorrect results for the `bins` variable.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the function `lib.generate_bins_dt64` should be used to calculate the `bins` directly without the need to calculate `bin_edges` separately. Additionally, the labels should be aligned with the closing behavior specified by the `closed` and `label` attributes of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, binner, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, -1)
    
    return binner, bins, binner
```

In the corrected code, the `generate_bins_dt64` function is used to directly calculate the `bins` based on the `ax_values` and `binner`. Additionally, the labels are aligned based on the closing behavior specified by the `closed` and `label` attributes. This should resolve the bug and provide the expected input/output variable information.
