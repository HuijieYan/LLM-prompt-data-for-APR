The bug in the function seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. This error occurs when groupby is called in the provided code sample, causing the grouping to fail.

The cause of the bug may be related to the incorrect handling of timestamps with ambiguous times, especially during the transition to daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This includes adjusting the bin edges and labels to account for ambiguous times, and ensuring that the grouping operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the ambiguous timestamps and adjusts the bin edges and labels accordingly. It should resolve the issue of the AmbiguousTimeError when using groupby with daily frequency on a day with a clock change in the provided GitHub issue.
