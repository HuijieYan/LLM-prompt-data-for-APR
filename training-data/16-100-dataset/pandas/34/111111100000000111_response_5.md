1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The function calls several related functions from the same file to calculate time bins, adjust bin edges, and generate bins, but there seems to be an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps, which is causing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation and handling of timestamps, particularly on days when there is a clock change, leading to ambiguous timestamps.

3. Elucidation of Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function: `_get_time_bins` attempts to calculate time bins based on the input datetime index.
   (b). The buggy class: `TimeGrouper` is the custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
   (c). The related functions: Other functions in the same file are involved in calculating time ranges, adjusting bin edges, and generating bins based on frequency and timestamp data.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The issue reported involves an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days, particularly in Cuba, which suggests a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps.

4. Possible Approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps, especially around clock change days.
   - Use the appropriate time zone conversion and timestamp adjustment methods to avoid AmbiguousTimeError.
   - Ensure that the time bins are properly aligned with the input datetime index.

5. Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other class and function definitions)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        # Use to_offset to ensure correct handling of ambiguous timestamps
        freq_offset = to_offset(self.freq)
        first = ax[0]
        last = ax[-1] + freq_offset
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # genral version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```
The corrected code includes using `to_offset` to handle ambiguous timestamps, adjusting the calculation of time ranges based on the frequency offset, and ensuring proper alignment of time bins with the input datetime index. This should help resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
