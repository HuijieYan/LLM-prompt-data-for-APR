1. The buggy function is intended to get time bins from a given DatetimeIndex and perform some calculations on it. However, there are several potential issues with the function, such as potential errors in calculating the time bins, adjusting bin edges, and handling labels.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of bins and labels, as well as in the adjustment of bin edges.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to incorrect calculations and adjustments of time bins, bin edges, and labels within the function, which may lead to incorrect results or errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the calculations and adjustments of time bins, bin edges, and labels to ensure they are performed correctly.
   - Checking for any potential off-by-one errors in the handling of bins and labels.
   - Ensuring that the function handles edge cases, such as empty input or NaN values, correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # assuming pd is the imported pandas library
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # calculate binner and labels
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)  # assuming _adjust_bin_edges is a valid function

    # calculate bins
    bins = pd.core.algorithms._bins_discretize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed == "right")

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- Importing the `pandas` library is assumed as `pd`.
- The function `pd.core.algorithms._bins_discretize` is used to calculate the bins.
- The adjustment of bin edges and handling of labels have been updated.
