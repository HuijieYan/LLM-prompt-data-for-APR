1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the pandas library, more specifically the `pandas.core.resample` module. It is related to the `pd.Grouper` function and is used to group time-series data based on a time frequency.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` for the time bins. Since the issue revolves around ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day, there might be an issue with how the function is handling these ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` attempts to calculate the time bins based on the input time series
   (b). It then calls the related function `_adjust_bin_edges` to adjust the bin edges, which could potentially lead to the bug if the adjustment is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that the bug occurs on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This ambiguity is not handled correctly by the function, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the code in `_get_time_bins` to specifically handle ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day, possibly by using the `ambiguous` parameter in pandas' date_range function.
   (b). Update the logic in `_adjust_bin_edges` to handle ambiguous timestamps more accurately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)  # Check for ambiguous timestamps in _adjust_bin_edges

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By specifically handling ambiguous timestamps using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function and checking for ambiguous timestamps in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function, the bug can be fixed to handle the issue reported in the GitHub post.
