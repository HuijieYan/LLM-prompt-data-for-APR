The buggy function "_get_time_bins" is designed to create time bins based on the input data and specified frequency. The bug appears to be caused by incorrect handling of time zones when creating the bins and labels.

The issue is likely in the following line of code:
```
binner = labels = date_range(
    freq=self.freq,
    start=first,
    end=last,
    tz=ax.tz,
    name=ax.name,
    ambiguous="infer",
    nonexistent="shift_forward",
)
```

The bug may arise when creating the "binner" and "labels" using the date_range function. The time zone (tz=ax.tz) is being passed directly from the input "ax" without accounting for how it should be handled within the date_range function, leading to discrepancies in the generated "binner" and "labels."

To fix the bug, the handling of time zones within the date_range function needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the creation of "binner" and "labels" should be revised to ensure consistency and accuracy in time assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.tz_convert(None),  # Convert to naive timezone
        end=last.tz_convert(None),  # Convert to naive timezone
        name=ax.name,
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- When creating "binner" and "bin_edges," the time zones are converted to naive time zones using the tz_convert(None) method, ensuring consistent time handling.
- The naming of the bins/labels is maintained, and the discrepancy in time is rectified, ensuring accuracy in binning and labeling.
