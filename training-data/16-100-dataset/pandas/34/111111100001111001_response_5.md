Analysis:
1. The buggy function is supposed to find the time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax` and other parameters. It uses the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to determine the first and last timestamps, and then calculates the time bins and labels. There is also a call to the `_adjust_bin_edges` function within the buggy function.

2. The potential error location is likely in the calculation of the time bins and labels, as well as the adjustment of bin edges using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values. The `ax_values` and `bin_edges` variables are being used to calculate the `bins`, but the length of these arrays do not match, leading to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `ax_values` and `bin_edges` have the same length and are correctly aligned.
   - Review the logic for calculating the time bins and labels to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    ).asi8

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the `bin_edges` are calculated correctly and aligned with the `ax_values`, and the time bins and labels are accurately calculated based on the input `ax`.
