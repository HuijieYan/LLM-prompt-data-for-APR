The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to arise from the handling of timestamps that are affected by a change due to daylight saving time (DST). In the failing test case, the groupby operation on a dataframe with timestamps affected by DST raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the `date_range` function is used to generate the bin edges, which does not account for the ambiguous timestamps that occur during the transition due to DST.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly. One possible approach to achieve this is to modify the generation of bins and labels to account for the ambiguous times during the transition due to DST.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0] - timedelta(microseconds=1)  # Adjust first timestamp to avoid ambiguity
    last = ax[-1]
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        periods=len(ax) + 1,  # Include the last timestamp
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner[1:]  # Exclude the first label to avoid ambiguous time
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function accounts for the ambiguous timestamp that occurs during the transition due to DST by adjusting the first timestamp when generating the bin edges. It also adjusts the labels accordingly to avoid ambiguous times.

With this corrected function, the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

Please note that the corrected function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it handles all relevant cases involving DST transitions.
