The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle the day with a clock change in Cuba (2018-11-04), resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This is due to the incorrect handling of daylight saving time in the generation of time bins and labels.

The bug is likely located in the creation of bins and labels based on the frequency and time zone. The function fails to correctly handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change, leading to the incorrect labeling and grouping of the data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for the ambiguous time during the clock change in the time zone. This involves adjusting the binning and labeling logic to correctly handle the transition from daylight saving time to standard time.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic for generating bins and labels to account for ambiguous times during daylight saving time transitions. This may involve using a different method for binning and labeling that considers the possibility of duplicate timestamps during the transition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use a method that accounts for daylight saving time transitions
    binner = label_bins_for_dst_transition(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, a new method `label_bins_for_dst_transition` is utilized to handle the labeling and binning of data during daylight saving time transitions. This should ensure that the labeling and grouping of data correctly accounts for ambiguous times, resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
