The buggy function is a part of the resample module in the Pandas library, and it seems to be related to time series data handling. The failing test "test_downsample_dst_at_midnight" is trying to downsample a time series with specific timestamp frequency, and the error message indicates an issue with inferring the daylight saving time.

The problematic area lies in the logic for creating the 'binner' and 'labels' variables. It seems that the function fails to properly account for daylight saving time when generating the bin edges and labels, leading to an ambiguous time error.

To address this issue, you should consider refining the logic for creating the 'binner' and 'labels', particularly taking into account the shifts in time that occur during transitions between standard time and daylight saving time.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to modify the logic for creating the 'binner' and 'labels' to explicitly handle daylight saving time shifts and ensure that the resulting bins and labels are unambiguous.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the logic for creating 'binner' and 'labels' is adjusted to handle daylight saving time shifts by using the "ambiguous" and "nonexistent" parameters appropriately when creating the date range. This modification should help to prevent the ambiguous time error and make the function compatible with the failing test.
