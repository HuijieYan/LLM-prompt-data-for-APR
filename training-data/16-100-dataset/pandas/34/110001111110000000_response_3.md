The issue in the provided buggy function is that the import for DatetimeIndex is not defined. It should be imported from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary import included:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By including the correct import statement for DatetimeIndex, the function should work as intended and resolve the issue causing the failing test.
