The bug in the function seems to be related to the calculation of bin edges. The variable `bin_edges` is calculated based on the `binner` and `ax_values`, but it seems to be incorrect based on the expected output.

The potential error location within the function is the calculation of `bin_edges` using the `_adjust_bin_edges` method.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output values lies in the calculation of `bin_edges`. The values in the `bin_edges` array are not aligned with the expected bins and labels.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `bin_edges` needs to be revised so that it aligns with the expected output values. This may involve adjusting the logic within the `_adjust_bin_edges` method or introducing a different approach to calculating the bin edges.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Calculate bin edges based on the binner and ax_values
    bin_edges = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Use the calculated bin edges to generate bins
    bins = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax.asi8)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

In this corrected code, the calculation of `bin_edges` is adjusted to use `lib.generate_bins_dt64` instead of the `_adjust_bin_edges` method. Additionally, the bins are calculated using `np.searchsorted` based on these bin edges to ensure they are accurately generated.
