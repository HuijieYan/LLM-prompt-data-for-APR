1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the `labels` variable.

3. The bug's cause is that the handling of the `labels` variable is not consistent or accurate. Depending on the conditions, the `labels` variable is modified in different ways, leading to potential inconsistencies and issues.

4. To fix the bug, the handling of the `labels` variable should be made consistent and accurate across all conditions. This can be achieved by restructuring the logic and error handling within the function and ensuring that the modifications to the `labels` variable are correctly handled.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the logic for modifying the `labels` variable has been restructured to be more consistent and accurate. The different conditions for modifying `labels` have been handled separately and accurately, ensuring correct behavior for different cases.
