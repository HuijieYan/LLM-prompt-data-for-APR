1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. This method calls functions like `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `date_range` from the same file, and interacts with the `pd.DataFrame.groupby` method. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to group a dataframe by day, and it triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` related to daylight saving time.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the construction of the time bins, which is causing a problem with the daylight saving time transition.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of timestamps and daylight saving time in the time binning process. The `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test indicates that there are ambiguous or repeated times which cannot be inferred due to the handling of the time bins.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the time bins are constructed in a way that accounts for daylight saving time transitions, without causing ambiguities or repeated times.
   - Reviewing the use of datetime indexes and time zone conversions to address any discrepancies in handling the time series data.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name, 
        ambiguous="infer", 
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `first` and `last` timestamps are obtained directly without using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function. Additionally, the `date_range` function is used with specific start and end timestamps, frequency, and other parameters to construct the time bins. These changes aim to address potential issues related to daylight saving time handling.
