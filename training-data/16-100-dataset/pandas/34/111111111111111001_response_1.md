The issue causing the error message is likely related to the incorrect calculation of time bins for the given datetime index. The error message indicates that there are no repeated times, leading to an ambiguous time error.

The problematic function `_get_time_bins` attempts to calculate the time bins based on the provided datetime index and its properties. However, it seems that the binning process is not handling the transition from daylight saving time to standard time correctly, which results in an ambiguous time error.

To fix this issue, the calculation of time bins needs to be adjusted to properly handle the transition between daylight saving time and standard time in the given timezone.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Ensure that the min and max are unambiguous by converting to UTC for binning
    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert('UTC')
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_utc.min(), ax_utc.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Convert the calculated first and last back to the original timezone
    first = first.tz_convert(ax.tz)
    last = last.tz_convert(ax.tz)

    # Use the original timezone for creating binner and labels
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the datetime index `ax` is converted to UTC for the binning process to ensure that the bin edges are unambiguous. After the bin edges are calculated, they are converted back to the original timezone for creating the binner and labels. This approach ensures that the time bins are calculated correctly, considering the timezone transitions, and should resolve the issue leading to the ambiguous time error.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and handle the transition between daylight saving time and standard time correctly.
