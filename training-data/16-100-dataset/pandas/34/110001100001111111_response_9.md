The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of the `last` timestamp, which may not be handling the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change correctly.

The bug's cause is related to the handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change, particularly in the calculation of the `last` timestamp and the subsequent creation of `binner` and `labels`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change appropriately and ensure that the `binner` and `labels` are created correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + pd.Timedelta(days=1),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change is adjusted, and the creation of `binner` and `labels` is corrected to ensure the expected output matches the actual output. This should also resolve the issue reported on the GitHub page.
