The issue occurs when using the `groupby` function with a daily frequency on a date range that includes a daylight saving time change in Cuba. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError, suggesting that the problem may be related to handling the ambiguous time during the clock change.

The bug appears to be located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. This function calculates the time bins for the given data. However, it fails to handle the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change in the specified time zone.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous time correctly during the daylight saving time change in the specified time zone.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to adjust the calculation of the time bins to account for the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change. This may involve using a different method to calculate the bins and labels, ensuring that the time change is handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
  
    binner = date_range(
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
  
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
  
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
  
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
  
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
  
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code properly handles the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug. It applies the appropriate adjustments to ensure the time bins and labels are calculated correctly in such scenarios. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the `groupby` function works as expected on dates that include a daylight saving time change.
