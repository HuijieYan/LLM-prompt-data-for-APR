The bug is caused by incorrect calculation of bin edges in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. This causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when running the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`.

The issue seems to stem from the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps, the subsequent calculation of `binner` and `labels`, and adjustments made based on the `self.closed` and `self.label` attributes. The incorrect bin edges are leading to ambiguous times during the grouping operation.

To fix this bug, the calculation of `first`, `last`, `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges` should be adjusted to ensure that the time bins are correctly formed, and to avoid any ambiguous time errors.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, NaT, date_range
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeArray
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
        
        tz = first.tz

        if self.closed == 'left':
            # Adjusting the first timestamp based on the frequency
            first = self.freq.rollback(first)
        else:
            # Adjusting the last timestamp based on the frequency
            last = self.freq.rollback(last)
    
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=first.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = np.array(ax, dtype=np.int64)
        bin_edges = np.array(binner, dtype=np.int64)
        
        # Adjusting bin edges based on the closed end of the interval
        if self.closed == 'right':
            bin_edges -= 1
        
        bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=True)
            
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the calculation of `first` and `last` is adjusted based on the `self.freq` attribute to ensure correct bin edges. Additionally, the bin edges are adjusted according to the closed end of the interval to avoid ambiguous time errors. The corrected function should now handle time binning correctly and pass the failing test.
