1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper`, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the date range generation, adjustment of bin edges, and handling of label and bin arrays.

3. (a) The buggy function `_get_time_bins` attempts to generate time bins based on the input axis, but it has issues with date range generation, adjustment of bin edges, and label and bin arrays manipulation.
   (b) The buggy class `TimeGrouper` relies on the `_get_time_bins` function to perform time-interval grouping by generating time bins and adjusting the bin edges.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the date range generation process and ensure it handles the start and end of the time intervals correctly.
   - Review the adjustment of bin edges to ensure it is functioning as intended.
   - Verify the manipulation of label and bin arrays to guarantee they align properly with the generated time bins.
   - Address any potential issues with the handling of time zone information and ambiguous/shift-forward occurrences.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError("axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}")

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels
    else:
        labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, the date range generation, adjustment of bin edges, and manipulation of labels and bins have been reviewed and fixed to ensure the proper alignment and handling of the time intervals.
