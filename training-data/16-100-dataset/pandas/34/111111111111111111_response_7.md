The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The failing test and error message indicate that there is an issue with handling ambiguous time during daylight saving time changes.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect construction of the frequency bins around the daylight saving time change, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to group the time series.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to correctly handle the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for generating frequency bins, taking into account the specific time where the change occurs.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is provided below:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, date_range, NaT
from pandas.core.resample import _get_timestamp_range_edges

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Adjust for ambiguous times during daylight saving changes
    first = first.tz_localize(None)
    last = last.tz_localize(None)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these modifications, the buggy function should now handle the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change correctly and pass the failing test. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
