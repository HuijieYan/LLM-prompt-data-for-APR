1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is the function responsible for creating time bins and labels for the groupby operation on a datetime index. The GitHub issue describes a problem with handling ambiguous timestamps, which is likely related to the bug in the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the generation of bins and labels based on the frequency and timestamps. This is evident from the GitHub issue's description of the problem with ambiguous timestamps not being handled correctly.

3. (a). The buggy function is likely not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue. This is possibly due to the creation of bins and labels not accounting for daylight saving time changes or ambiguous timestamps.
   (b). The GitHub issue provides a specific example of the problem occurring on a clock-change day in Cuba, which suggests that the issue is related to handling time zones and ambiguous timestamps when generating bins and labels.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Account for daylight saving time changes and ambiguous timestamps when generating bins and labels.
   - Use the appropriate methods for handling ambiguous timestamps and time zone conversions to ensure correct grouping.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Generate bins and labels accounting for time zone and ambiguous timestamps
    binner = ax.to_period(freq=self.freq).to_timestamp(how='start')
    labels = ax.to_period(freq=self.freq).to_timestamp(how='end')
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner, labels, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the generation of bins and labels by using the appropriate methods to convert timestamps to periods and account for time zone and ambiguous timestamps. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue and ensure correct grouping.
