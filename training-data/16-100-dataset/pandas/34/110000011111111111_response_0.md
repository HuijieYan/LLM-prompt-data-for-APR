The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when converting time zones. This bug causes the `groupby` operation to raise an AmbiguousTimeError when dealing with daily frequency and a long clock-change day, as observed in the failing test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when creating the `labels` using the `date_range` function. The function seems to be failing to handle the ambiguous timestamps during the time zone conversion, leading to the error.

The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The `_get_time_bins` function, as provided, fails to handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
(b). The failing test tries to downsample data with daily frequency across a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.
(c). The discrepancy between the expected and actual output variables is related to the labels generated by the function when dealing with ambiguous timestamps.
(d). The GitHub issue confirms that there is a problem with the handling of ambiguous timestamps in time zone conversion.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to improve the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function by making use of the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function to set a strategy to handle ambiguous times during the time zone conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    ambiguous = "infer" if ax.tz is not None else None  # set ambiguous based on ax.tz
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=ambiguous,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code makes use of the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to infer how to handle ambiguous times during time zone conversion based on the time zone information in the input `ax`.

This corrected code should (a) pass the failing test, (b) satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and (c) successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
