The bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the ambiguous time error caused by the clock change in Cuba. This is causing the groupby operation to raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug is likely caused by the way the function is handling the time range edges and creating bins for the time series data. It seems that the function is not taking into account the possibility of ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change in Cuba.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by daylight saving time transitions, specifically on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for creating time bins and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps. This may involve checking for ambiguous timestamps and handling them appropriately, potentially by using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function takes into account the potential for ambiguous timestamps and handles them appropriately using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function. This modification should resolve the issue and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised during the groupby operation.
