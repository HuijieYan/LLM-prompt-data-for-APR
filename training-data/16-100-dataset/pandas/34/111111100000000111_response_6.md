1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is called by the `groupby` method, specifically in cases where there is a daily frequency with time zone localization, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be in the handling of ambiguous timestamps and the generation of time bins, which may not account for the ambiguous time issue during the clock change day in Cuba.

3. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the `TimeGrouper` class, which has methods like `_adjust_bin_edges`, and it also interacts with other functions like `_get_timestamp_range_edges` from the same file. The GitHub issue details a similar problem related to ambiguous time handling during a clock change day in Cuba, which points to the cause of the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include implementing proper handling for ambiguous time during a clock change day, potentially by using a different approach for time bin generation, and incorporating logic to account for ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT, Lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = Lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes proper handling for ambiguous timestamps during time bin generation, as well as adjustments to ensure the labels match the bins. It is designed to resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
