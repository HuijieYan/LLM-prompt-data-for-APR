This buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is responsible for calculating time bins for resampling operations. The failing test is related to the resampling operation on a datatime index, and it fails due to an AmbiguousTimeError. This error is thrown when there are no repeated times during daylight saving time transition, and the library cannot infer the appropriate time.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the `label` handling and `ax` field manipulation.

The bug causes the resampling operation to fail when dealing with daylight saving time transitions because it tries to infer the time bins without handling ambiguous times appropriately. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError being raised when no repeated times are found during DST transition periods.

To fix the bug, we need to handle ambiguous times explicitly and ensure that the resampling operation can cope with DST transitions appropriately.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes handling of ambiguous times using the 'ambiguous="infer"' parameter in the date_range function. This will help the resampling operation handle DST transitions appropriately and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
