The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the creation of `binner`, `labels`, and `bin_edges`. There is also an issue with the calculation of `bins`.

The issue seems to be originating from the `date_range` function, which is used to create `binner` and `labels`. This function is not taking into account the timezone information provided in the input `ax`. As a result, the `binner` and `labels` are being created with the wrong timezone information.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the timezone information is preserved when creating `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, Timestamp, NaT, Timedelta
import numpy as np
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax.min().floor('D')
        last = ax.max().ceil('D')
        binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
        
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the timezone information from the input `ax` is preserved when creating `binner` using the `date_range` function. This should resolve the issue with the timezone mismatch.
