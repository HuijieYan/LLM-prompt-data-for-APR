The bug is in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The error message indicates a problem with inferring daylight saving time (DST) when converting the time index to the "America/Havana" timezone. This problem is likely due to incorrect binning of the time index.

The `_get_time_bins` function takes an index (`ax`) and attempts to bin the time values based on the specified frequency, timezone, and closed interval. It then returns the binned values.

The bug likely stems from the incorrect binning of time values, which leads to an ambiguous time error when converting to the "America/Havana" timezone.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure the time binning is done correctly and takes into account the presence of daylight saving time transitions.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the `pandas.core.groupby.GroupGrouper` class to perform the time binning, as it handles frequency inference, daylight saving time transitions, and ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import GroupGrouper

# ...

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use GroupGrouper to handle time binning
    grouper = GroupGrouper(self.freq, ax, obj=None, axis=0)
    binner, bins, binlabels = grouper.get_grouper(obj=ax, validate=False)

    return binner, bins, binlabels
```

With this correction, the time binning process is handled by the `GroupGrouper` class, which should correctly handle the frequency inference, daylight saving time transitions, and ambiguous times. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
