The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is encountering an issue due to a time zone shift that results in an ambiguous timestamp. This is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised in the calling function.

The potential error location is likely in the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, as it does not account for the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba.

The bug is caused by a missing handling for ambiguous times during the time bin calculation, leading to incorrect grouping of the data and the raised `AmbiguousTimeError`. This discrepancy matches the issue reported on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba correctly and adjust the bin calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax[0].floor('D'), ax[-1].ceil('D')  # Adjust for ambiguous time
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes adjustments in the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps to account for ambiguous times and ensures that the grouping is handled correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
