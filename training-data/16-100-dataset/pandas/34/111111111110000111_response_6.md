The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called by the failing test and is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to downsample a dataframe with a timezone conversion, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to handling daylight saving time.

The bug is likely located in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function, which doesn't handle ambiguous time correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `Date_range` function used in the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `Date_range` function needs to be replaced with a function that correctly handles ambiguous time. This can be achieved by using the `DatetimeIndex` instead of `Date_range` to correctly handle daylight saving time and ambiguous time.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = ax
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

This corrected code will use the `DatetimeIndex` to handle ambiguous time correctly when creating the `binner` and `labels`. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and make the failing test pass.

Note: the class `TimeGrouper` and related functions have not been modified, as the issue seems to be isolated in the `_get_time_bins` function.
