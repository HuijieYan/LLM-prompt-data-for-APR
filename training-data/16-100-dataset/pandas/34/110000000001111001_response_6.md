Issue:
The bug seems to be located in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. There are discrepancies between the expected and actual output for these variables, as well as for `bins`. It appears that the calculation of `binner` and `labels` is not aligning with the expected frequency, and the generation of `bins` is also producing unexpected results.

Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `binner` and `labels`, as well as the generation of `bins`, aligns with the expected frequency and ranges based on the input datetime index.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas import DateOffset, Timestamp, DatetimeIndex, NaT, timedelta, Date

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max() + DateOffset(days=1)

    # Generate date range based on the frequency of the index
    binner = DateRange(start=first, end=last, freq=ax.freq)

    # Check for any values outside the binner range
    out_of_range = ax[(ax < first) | (ax >= last)]
    if out_of_range.any():
        raise ValueError("Values falls after last bin")

    # Generate bins based on the calculated binner
    bins = binner.searchsorted(ax, side=self.closed)

    # Adjust labels based on the closed and label parameters
    labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This code fixes the bug by calculating the `binner` and `labels` based on the frequency of the input datetime index. It also ensures that the `bins` are generated accurately based on the binner range and the closed parameter. Additionally, it checks for any values outside the binner range and raises a ValueError if found.
