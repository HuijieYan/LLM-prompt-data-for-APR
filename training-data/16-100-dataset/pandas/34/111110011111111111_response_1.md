The cause of the bug is that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the call to groupby in the code is raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the way it is handling the date/time binning and labeling, especially on the day when there is a clock change.

The failing test is trying to group data into 1-day intervals, but the implementation is unable to handle the ambiguous timestamps resulting from the clock change.

The discrepancy between expected and actual output values is evident in the error message, which indicates that the timestamp is ambiguous.

To fix the bug, you can modify the _get_time_bins() function to handle the ambiguous timestamp properly. This can be done by adjusting the bin edges and labeling to ensure that the time intervals are correctly defined, especially on the day when there is a clock change.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # set ambiguous argument to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This correction should handle the ambiguous timestamp properly and ensure that the time intervals are correctly defined, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
