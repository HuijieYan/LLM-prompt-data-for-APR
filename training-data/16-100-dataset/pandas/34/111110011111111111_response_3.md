The bug is likely located in the _get_time_bins method of the TimeGrouper class. The function seems to have a problem handling ambiguous times during a clock change, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug is likely caused by the use of date_range to generate the binner and labels, which does not handle ambiguous times correctly.

To fix the bug, the _get_time_bins method should use the .resample method instead of date_range to handle the ambiguous times correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    binner, bins = ax.to_series().resample(self.freq).apply(lambda x: x.max())
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner.shift(-1)
    else:
        labels = binner

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle ambiguous times correctly and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
