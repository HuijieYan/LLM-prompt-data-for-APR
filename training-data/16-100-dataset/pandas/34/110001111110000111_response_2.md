The buggy function is a method named `_get_time_bins` located in the class of the same file: `pandas/core/resample.py`. This method is called by the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` located in the file `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`. The failing test is throwing an `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

The `_get_time_bins` function calculates time bins for a given axis. The issue seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous time during the daylight saving time change. The error message points to the fact that the time 2018-11-04 00:00:00 is ambiguous, and thus it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. 

The failing test is trying to group the data in the `dataframe` using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D').mean()` and asserts whether the result is as expected. 

The GitHub issue explains that on the day of the clock change in Cuba, midnight local time is ambiguous, and the call to `groupby` raises the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The expected result is to have three groups, one for each day, with the group for the 4th of November being labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00'.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle ambiguous times during the daylight saving time change. We need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle this scenario and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This can be achieved by utilizing the `ambiguous` parameter when creating the date range.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, DataFrame, NaT, date_range
from pandas.tseries.api import lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected version now handles the ambiguous time issue during the daylight saving time change in the `_get_time_bins` function. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
