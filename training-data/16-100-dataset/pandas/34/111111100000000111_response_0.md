1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library, specifically in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function works with a `DatetimeIndex` object and is responsible for grouping time intervals.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to handle ambiguous timestamps. This is indicated by the GitHub issue's description, which mentions that on clock change days in Cuba, the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps as expected.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` checks if the axis is a `DatetimeIndex` and then proceeds to conduct date range operations.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for grouping time intervals using a specified frequency.
   (c). The related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are called within `_get_time_bins` to calculate the bin edges and adjust them accordingly.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information indicates that on clock change days in Cuba, ambiguous timestamps are not handled correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for ambiguous timestamps and handle them appropriately to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
   - Use timezone-aware operations to accurately handle time intervals, especially on days with daylight saving time changes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
from pandas.core.resample import _get_timestamp_range_edges

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    binner = binner.normalize()
    labels = labels.normalize()

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, ambiguous timestamps are handled by normalizing the bin edges and labels. This approach should help in resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
