The issue in the buggy function is likely related to the conversion of timestamps across daylight saving time changes. The function `_get_time_bins` attempts to create time bins and labels from a given DatetimeIndex, but it fails to handle an ambiguous time error on days with daylight saving time changes, such as the specific case of Cuba.

The bug seems to be arising due to the creation of bins and labels using the `date_range` function, which is not handling the ambiguous time caused by the daylight saving time transition correctly. This results in incorrect bin and label creation, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the date range creation takes into account the ambiguous time and does not result in incorrect bin and label values.
2. We need to handle any edge cases related to ambiguous times explicitly.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the issue reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the function should be able to handle ambiguous times due to daylight saving time changes effectively.
