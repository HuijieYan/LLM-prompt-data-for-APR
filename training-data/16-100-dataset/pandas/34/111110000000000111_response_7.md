1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which seems to be a custom class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue points to a problem with `pd.Grouper` when handling daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely the handling of time intervals and labels, especially around the time of the clock change.

3. (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins and labels based on the input axis.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class seems to be an extension of the `Grouper` class, possibly adding functionality specific to time-based grouping.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that on a clock change day in Cuba, the call to `groupby` with daily frequency raises an AmbiguousTimeError, which relates to the handling of the time intervals and labels.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adjusting the handling of time intervals and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days.
   - Ensuring that the time bins and labels are correctly aligned with the time zone changes during the clock change day.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT', nonexistent='NaT')
    labels = binner.shift(1)
    labels = labels.insert(0, binner[0] - self.freq)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code adjusts the generation of time bins and labels to handle ambiguous timestamps using `floor` and `shift` methods, ensuring that the labels are appropriately aligned with the time zone changes and avoiding the AmbiguousTimeError during daily frequency grouping on clock change days in Cuba.
