Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The function is responsible for creating time bins based on a given input `ax` which should be a `DatetimeIndex`. The function internally calls several other functions like `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` to calculate the time bins.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. This is where the timestamps might be getting assigned incorrectly, leading to the issue described in the GitHub post.

3. The bug's cause may be related to how the time bins are being calculated and labeled, especially when dealing with ambiguous time stamps. The GitHub issue describes a situation where the groupby with daily frequency fails on a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Address the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins to ensure that the groupby operation does not result in AmbiguousTimeError, especially in the context of timezone changes and ambiguous time stamps.

2. Ensure that the labels for the time bins are correctly assigned without ambiguity, taking into account timezone changes and daylight saving time.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Ensure that normalize is set to True to handle ambiguous dates
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version,  knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function adds `normalize=True` to the `date_range` call to handle ambiguous dates and ensure that the time bins are calculated correctly, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post.
