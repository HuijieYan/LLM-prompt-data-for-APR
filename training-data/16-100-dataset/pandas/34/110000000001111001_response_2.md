The issue with the function seems to be with the calculation of the bin edges. Since the "last" timestamp generated for the bins is in a different timezone than the "first" timestamp, it leads to incorrect bin edges. This is causing the discrepancy in the "bins" variable.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the "last" timestamp is converted to the same timezone as the "first" timestamp before generating the bin edges.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import numpy as np
import pandas._libs.lib as lib
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first_timestamp = ax.min()
    last_timestamp = ax.max()

    timezone = ax.tz or first_timestamp.tz
    
    first = Timestamp(first_timestamp, tz=timezone)
    last = Timestamp(last_timestamp, tz=timezone)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=timezone,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, we have explicitly handled the timezone for the "first" and "last" timestamps, ensuring that they are in the same timezone. This should resolve the issue with the generation of bin edges and lead to correct bin calculations.
