The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` which is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class. The failing test that is calling this function is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`, which is trying to group time intervals using the `pd.Grouper` method. The error message is reporting an `AmbiguousTimeError` on line 966 when calling `date_range` in the `_get_time_bins` function. This error is likely caused by an issue with handling daylight saving time (DST) transitions.

The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is the `date_range` call, as indicated by the error message. It seems that the `date_range` function is unable to handle the DST transition scenario and is raising the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle DST transitions properly when creating the time bins and labels. One approach is to identify and handle ambiguous or nonexistent times when creating the datetime index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    # Handle ambiguous and nonexistent times when creating the datetime index
    binner = pd.date_range(
        start=ax[0], end=ax[-1] + pd.Timedelta('1D'), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, ambiguous='NaT', nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )
    labels = binner[1:]
    binner = binner[:-1]
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, when creating the datetime index, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to 'NaT' and the `nonexistent` parameter is set to 'shift_forward' to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times, respectively. This should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure that DST transitions are handled properly.
