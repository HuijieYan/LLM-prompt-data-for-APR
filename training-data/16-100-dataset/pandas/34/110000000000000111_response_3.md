1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue, we can see that the function `_get_time_bins` is part of the pandas library, and it is used for creating time bins for grouping time series data. The GitHub issue relates to a problem with the `pd.Grouper` function when dealing with time series data that includes ambiguous timestamps, particularly on days with a clock change.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of time bins and labels, specifically in cases where the time series data contains ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps, as described in the GitHub issue. The `_get_time_bins` function might not be handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Improving the handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zone conversions within the `_get_time_bins` function.
   (b). Ensuring that the time bins and labels are created correctly, taking into account potential ambiguous timestamps in the time series data.
   (c). Testing the function with time series data that includes ambiguous timestamps to ensure that it handles them appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Handling ambiguous timestamps and time zone conversions
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Ensure normalization of timestamps to avoid ambiguity
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, I added a parameter `normalize=True` to the `date_range` function to ensure that timestamps in the time series data are normalized, thus avoiding ambiguous timestamps. Additionally, I included comments to highlight the key changes made to address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
