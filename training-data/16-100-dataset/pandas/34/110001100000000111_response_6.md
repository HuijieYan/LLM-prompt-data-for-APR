1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the resample.py file in the pandas library. It is responsible for handling time-based grouping of data, but it fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of 'binner' and 'labels' using the 'date_range' function. It seems that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function fails to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). The related functions, such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`, are responsible for calculating the time range edges and adjusting the bin edges, but they don't directly contribute to the AmbiguousTimeError issue.
   (c). The GitHub issue specifies that the problem arises when dealing with a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous. This aligns with the bug manifestation in the code.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Implement handling for ambiguous timestamps, specifically addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
   (b). Refactor the code related to date range calculations and adjustment of bin edges to ensure correct handling of ambiguous timestamps.
   (c). Utilize built-in pandas functions or libraries to handle ambiguous timezones and daylight saving time transitions.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use date_range with proper handling of ambiguous timestamps
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times as NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code aims to address the issue by using the date_range function with proper handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically setting ambiguous times to 'NaT' to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
