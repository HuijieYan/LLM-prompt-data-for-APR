The issue is caused by the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function becoming `None` before it is intended to in the PeriodEngine class. This is resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex, causing the AttributeError when trying to access a method on this `None` object.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed. We also need to update the PeriodEngine class to handle weak referencing properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).get()
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used within the `_engine_type` class, and then it is dereferenced using the `get()` method to obtain the actual object.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
