The problem with the function seems to stem from the _engine_type attribute, as it is not properly assigned and is returning a 'NoneType' object. This is likely causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the _engine_type attribute is properly assigned with the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = PeriodEngine  # Assign the correct type of object to the _engine_type attribute
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the function should be able to return the correct type of object without causing the AttributeError, and should pass the failing test.
