Potential error location: 
The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which means if `period` is a weak reference to `self`, then `PeriodIndex` instances should be able to get garbage-collected even when `period` still exists, leading to a `NoneType` being returned.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and `period` appears to be a weak reference to `self`. This means `PeriodIndex` instances are being garbage-collected even when `period` still exists, leading to a `NoneType` being returned, causing the AttributeError.

(b). The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is asserting that all levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic, causing the bug to manifest and the test to fail.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that `period` is not being garbage-collected prematurely by using a stronger reference.
2. Investigate the interaction between `PeriodIndex._engine` and `MultiIndex` to understand how weak referencing is affecting the behavior of the weak reference.
3. Review the use of weak referencing in the `_engine` function to see if a stronger reference is needed.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_engine` is as follows:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = ref(self)  # Use weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the problematic function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub post.
