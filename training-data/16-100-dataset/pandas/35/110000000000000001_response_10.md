1. The buggy function is a decorator function that is supposed to cache the output of the _engine function so that it doesn't need to be recalculated every time it is called.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the decorator @cache_readonly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the @cache_readonly decorator is missing from the code provided. This decorator is essential for the caching functionality to work.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add the @cache_readonly decorator to the function.
   - Implement the caching functionality within the decorator.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_func = lru_cache()(func)
    
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return cached_func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, I have added a custom decorator called cache_readonly, which uses the lru_cache function from the functools module to implement caching for the _engine function. The @cache_readonly decorator is then applied to the _engine function to ensure that its output is cached.
