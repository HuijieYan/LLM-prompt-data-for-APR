The buggy function is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that it is intended to be a cached property. However, the function is not properly using the weakref to avoid a reference cycle, which is likely causing the bug.

When the function is called, it is creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. This weak reference should then be used in the `_engine_type` function to avoid circular references.

The bug is likely caused by the function not properly utilizing the weak reference, leading to potential circular references and memory leaks.

To fix the bug, the function should use the weak reference in the call to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is still created using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is then passed to the `_engine_type` function to avoid the reference cycle.

By using the weak reference properly, the bug causing potential circular references and memory leaks should be fixed.
