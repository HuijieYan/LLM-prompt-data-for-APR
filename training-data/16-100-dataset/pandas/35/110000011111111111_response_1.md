Potential error location: The error occurs in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` of the `_engine` function.

Bug cause:
(a). The `_engine` function seems to be creating an instance of `self._engine_type` using `period` and `len(self)` as parameters. However, it's not clear how `period` is being used here, and it appears to be intended to be a weak reference of `self`.
(b). The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking for monotonicity of the levels in `idx2`. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
(c). The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value is that `PeriodIndex` is intended to be weakly referenced, but due to the bug, it's not being handled correctly, leading to the `NoneType` error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the weakref is properly used to create a weak reference to `self` and then passed to `_engine_type` without being dropped prematurely.
- Handle the weakref appropriately to avoid the `NoneType` error in the `PeriodEngine`.

Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

The corrected code uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and passes it as `weak_self` to `_engine_type`. This approach ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and resolves the `NoneType` error. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, effectively resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
