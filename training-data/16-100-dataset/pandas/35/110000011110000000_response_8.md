To fix the buggy function, you can use the `functools` module to create a `cache_readonly` decorator and then apply it to the `_engine` method. Here's the corrected version:

```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

# create a cache_readonly decorator using functools
def cache_readonly(fn):
    return property(lru_cache()(fn))

# apply the cache_readonly decorator to the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By applying the `lru_cache` decorator using the `functools` module, the `_engine` method will now have caching capability that should resolve the issue causing the failing test.
