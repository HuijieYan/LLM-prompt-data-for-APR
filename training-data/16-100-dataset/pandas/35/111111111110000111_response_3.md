Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be caused by the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

In the `PeriodIndex` class, the `_engine` function creates a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) and returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. However, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained throughout the lifespan of the `_engine`, so that it does not get garbage collected prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._period_ref = period  # Store the weak reference in the engine
    return engine
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is stored within the `PeriodEngine` instance. This should prevent the premature garbage collection of the `PeriodIndex` instance and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
