The potential error in the `_engine` function is the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This is incorrect because `self` is already a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, so creating another weak reference to it is unnecessary and causes the bug.

To fix the bug, we can simply return `self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))` instead of creating a weak reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))
```
