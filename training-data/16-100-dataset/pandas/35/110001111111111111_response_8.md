The bug is likely located in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class, as it is failing to return the expected value and causing an AttributeError when the failing test is executed. The failing test is asserting that all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic, and the error message indicates that the _engine is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected value, causing the AttributeError.

The failing test is trying to create a MultiIndex with levels derived from a PeriodIndex using the _get_level_values function. However, due to a bug in the _engine function, it is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodEngine object, causing the failing test to raise an AttributeError.

The GitHub issue indicates that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None object instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error.

To fix this bug, the _engine function should correctly create and return the PeriodEngine object, ensuring that it does not drop the weakly referenced PeriodIndex prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

With this correction, the _engine function will return the PeriodEngine object as expected, preventing the AttributeError from occurring in the failing test. This should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
