The issue with the buggy function is that it's trying to access the `_engine_type` attribute from `self`, but it's not defined anywhere in the function or the class. This is leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly defined and accessible within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, `self._engine_type` has been replaced with `PeriodEngine` assuming that `PeriodEngine` is the correct engine type to be used in this context.

With this correction, the function should now be able to create the `_engine` object without raising an AttributeError, and it should pass the failing test.
