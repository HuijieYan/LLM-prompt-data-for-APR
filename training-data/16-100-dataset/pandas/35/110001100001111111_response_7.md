Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped before it should, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Bug's cause:
The _engine function is using weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex, but it seems that this weak reference is not being kept alive until it is used by the PeriodEngine.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is kept alive until it is used by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable that has a longer lifetime.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py
# Fixed version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a reference to the weakref to ensure it is not dropped prematurely
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
By storing the weak reference in the self._period_weakref variable, it ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is used by the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
