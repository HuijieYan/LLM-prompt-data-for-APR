The buggy function '_engine' is a method of the PeriodIndex class. It returns an instance of _engine_type by passing a weak reference of self and the length of the PeriodIndex. The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' creates a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checks if all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic. The error message indicates that the 'view' attribute is being accessed on a 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the weak reference is not being utilized properly and the PeriodEngine is receiving a None object instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides further context, stating that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference of self needs to be maintained properly so that the PeriodEngine does not receive a NoneType object.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to use the weakref module to create a weak reference to the self object and then access it within the _engine method to ensure that a valid reference to the PeriodIndex is passed to the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, a weak reference to the self object is created using weakref.ref(), and then accessed using period_ref() to ensure that a valid reference to the PeriodIndex is passed to the PeriodEngine.

With this corrected code, the failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' should pass successfully, and the issue described in the GitHub post should also be resolved.
