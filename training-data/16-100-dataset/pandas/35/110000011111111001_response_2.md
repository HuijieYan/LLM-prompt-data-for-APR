The buggy function `@cache_readonly` decorator is not defined in the provided code, and it seems that the issue is with creating an instance of `_engine_type`, which appears to be a class. The `weakref.ref(self)` is not used correctly, and it should be passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it is not doing so in the current implementation.

The failing test is related to `PeriodIndex._engine`, and the error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` due to a 'NoneType' object when trying to access the `view` property.

To fix the bug:
- The `_engine` function should create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to the constructor of `_engine_type`.
- Ensure that the `_engine_type` initializes correctly and does not result in a `NoneType` object when being accessed.

The corrected code for the `@cache_readonly` function is not provided in the description, so it is assumed to be a decorator for caching the result of the function. Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

The key change here is the addition of `()` after `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to ensure that the constructor is called and an instance is returned.

With this correction, the `_engine` function will pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` and return the instance of `_engine_type`. This should address the `AttributeError` mentioned in the failing test, and the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
