The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This is commonly used to avoid reference cycles and memory leaks, but it seems that it is not being used correctly here.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. This will allow the `_engine_type` method to access the PeriodIndex object without causing a reference cycle.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the `_engine` function should now create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object correctly, resolving the reference cycle issue and fixing the bug. This should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
