The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped before its intended use, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the `_engine` function not correctly handling weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, you could modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type(period, length):
        return PeriodEngine(period, length)
    
    return engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is maintained within the `_engine` function, and then passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor when creating the engine instance.

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be maintained properly, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
