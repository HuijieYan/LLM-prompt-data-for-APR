The buggy function is a property called `_engine`. It takes in the input parameter `self` which is a `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to create a new `_engine_type` using this `PeriodIndex`. The error message indicates that the `_engine` property is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides more context on the problem. It explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and properly utilized within the `_engine` property so that it does not get deleted prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            self._engine_cache = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._engine_cache
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, the `weakref.proxy` function is used to create a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` to prevent a reference cycle and ensure that `self` is not deleted prematurely. This should address the issue and ensure that the `_engine` property returns the expected `PeriodEngine` object.
