# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}

    def inner(self):
        if func.__name__ not in cache:
            cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return cache[func.__name__]

    return inner

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
