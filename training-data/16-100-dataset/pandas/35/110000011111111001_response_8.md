Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct type of value expected by the test. The error message specifically mentions an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object, indicating that the returned value might be incorrect.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect return value type from the `_engine` function, leading to an AttributeError when accessing the 'view' attribute later in the code.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to return the correct value type expected by the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))._data.view("i8")
```

This correction ensures that the `_engine` function returns the expected type, and it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
