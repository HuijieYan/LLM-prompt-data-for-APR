The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The use of `weakref.ref` here is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems to be utilized incorrectly.

The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the failure in the GitHub issue described.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive for as long as needed.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_value = None
    
    def wrapper(self):
        nonlocal cached_value
        if cached_value is None:
            cached_value = func(self)
        return cached_value
    
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a weak reference of self throughout function execution
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref(), len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that a weak reference to `self` is kept alive throughout the function's execution and used as needed. It should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
