The problem is that when creating the weak reference to `self` using `period = weakref.ref(self)`, `period` is immediately deleted after the creation and the weak reference disappears. This is why the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains alive as long as it's needed. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes) ...

    # Corrected _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference as an attribute
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

This change will ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` object is alive. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
