1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It seems to be returning the result of calling the `_engine_type` method with the `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the `is_monotonic` property of the values in the `MultiIndex` object that is created. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised within the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `IndexEngine` class due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely the return statement where it calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This might be returning `None` instead of an actual object, leading to the AttributeError later on in the code.

3. Analysis:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an object created by calling the `_engine_type` method with certain arguments.
   (b). The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to access the `is_monotonic` property of the values in the `MultiIndex` object.
   (c). The error message indicates that the `IndexEngine` is encountering an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object being accessed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object and does not return `None`.
   - Check if the arguments passed to the `_engine_type` method are appropriate and result in a valid object being returned.
   - Investigate if there are any issues with the initialization of `_engine_type` or if it depends on internal state that may not be properly set.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```
By explicitly checking for `None` and raising a `ValueError` in case it is returned, the corrected function ensures that a valid object is always returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
