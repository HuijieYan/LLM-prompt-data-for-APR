1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the PeriodIndex class in the pandas library. This method is responsible for initializing the engine for the PeriodIndex, which is used for various operations on the index. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checks if the created MultiIndex is monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` method is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is returning a 'NoneType' object, which is causing the AttributeError when the test tries to access the 'view' attribute.

3. The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` method not correctly initializing the engine for the PeriodIndex, resulting in a 'NoneType' object being returned when it is accessed in other methods like `is_monotonic_increasing`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method and ensure that it is creating and returning the correct engine object.
   - Verify that the weakref of self is being used correctly in creating the engine.
   - Ensure that the engine is properly initialized with the necessary attributes and methods to avoid returning a 'NoneType' object.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from pandas.core.computation.cache import cache_readonly
import weakref

# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

class PeriodIndex:
    # other methods of the class...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is None:
            raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed")
        return engine
```

In the corrected code, we are explicitly checking if the engine created by `_engine_type` is None, and if so, raising a ValueError to indicate that engine initialization has failed. This ensures that a 'NoneType' object is not returned and should fix the AttributeError in the failing test.
