```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.core.dtypes.common import Period

# The fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is None:
        return None
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```
The issue was due to the `_engine_type` being None, so we need to add a check for that in the function. This should fix the issue and prevent the AttributeError from happening.
