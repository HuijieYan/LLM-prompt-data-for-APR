1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method that is being used as a property with `@cache_readonly` decorator. It seems to be part of a class, as it references `self`. The function appears to be using weak referencing, creating a weak reference of `self` and then using it to create an instance of `_engine_type`. The failing test is related to `MultiIndex` and `PeriodIndex`. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where it seems that the weak reference `period` might not be correctly used.

3. Cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`.
   (b). The failing test is trying to check if some properties of the `MultiIndex` are valid but is instead raising an AttributeError due to a NoneType object.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the weak reference `period` is being correctly used to create the instance of `_engine_type`.
   (b). Check the implementation of weak referencing to ensure that the referenced object is not being dropped prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

# Corrected function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

This corrected code uses the `ref` function to create a weak reference to `self` and then passes it to `_engine_type` as intended.

This should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
