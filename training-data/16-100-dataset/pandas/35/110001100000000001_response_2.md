The buggy function is a method called "_engine" within the "period.py" file of the pandas library. The function is using a decorator called "@cache_readonly" which implies that the function should only be computed once and then the result should be cached for future use.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of "weakref.ref(self)" to create a weak reference to the "self" object. This weak reference is then passed to "_engine_type" along with the length of "self".

The bug's cause is that the weak reference is not being properly used and passed to the "_engine_type" function. This can lead to issues with memory management and reference cycles.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly created and utilized to avoid any reference cycle issues. Additionally, the parameters being passed to "_engine_type" should be reviewed to ensure they are being used correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
