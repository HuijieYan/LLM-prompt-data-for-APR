Potential Error Location: The potential error is with the caching mechanism used in the _engine function, where it is attempting to create a weak reference to self and store it in the 'period' variable. 

Bug Cause: The use of weakref.ref is causing the weak reference to get garbage collected immediately, resulting in the _engine function not being able to access the weak reference to self, leading to potential issues in the functioning of the PeriodIndex class.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we can use the functools.lru_cache decorator instead of weakref.ref to implement the caching mechanism. This will ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained and used properly within the caching mechanism.

Corrected Code:
```python
import functools

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    @functools.lru_cache()
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have used the functools.lru_cache decorator to implement the caching mechanism, which automatically handles the caching of the _engine function results using a least-recently-used strategy. This approach ensures that the weak reference to self is maintained and used properly within the caching mechanism.
