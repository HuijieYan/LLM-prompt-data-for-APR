1. The buggy function, `_engine`, is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is being used in the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the MultiIndex module, which assesses the monotonicity of the index. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `view("i8")` method being called on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic `_engine` function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. It seems that the `_engine_type` might not be instantiated properly, resulting in returning a `NoneType` object. 

3. (a). The buggy function:
   The `_engine` function initializes the engine and returns it; however, it seems to be returning a `NoneType` object, which causes the AttributeError mentioned in the error message.
   (b). The buggy class:
   The `PeriodIndex` class contains the buggy function `_engine` which is supposed to initialize the engine for the index.
   (c). The failing test and error message:
   The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` attempts to assess monotonicity, but it's encountering an AttributeError when trying to access the `view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the instantiation of `_engine_type` to ensure it's returning the appropriate object type and not None.
   - Verify the logic within the `_engine` function to ensure that it correctly instantiates and returns the engine.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic `_engine` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize the engine")
    return engine
```
