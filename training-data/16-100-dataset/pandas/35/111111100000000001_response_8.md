The potential error location within the problematic function is in the use of the `weakref.ref` method. This method is returning a weak reference to the `self` object. However, this approach is incorrect as it would result in a weak reference being returned instead of the actual object, and subsequently, the `_engine_type` method would be called with a weak reference instead of the intended object.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `weakref.ref` method and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):

    # ... (other code)

    # The corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the correct object is passed to the `_engine_type` method, which fixes the bug in the original code.
