The issue here seems to be with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that there may be an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class, which is possibly related to the `_engine` function.

The error message suggests that the `_do_monotonic_check` method within the `IndexEngine` class is trying to access a value that is `None`. This likely means that the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` function should return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which is responsible for handling the underlying implementation of the `PeriodIndex` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the `_engine` function should now return a valid instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, resolving the issue described in the error message. This should allow the failing test to pass and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
