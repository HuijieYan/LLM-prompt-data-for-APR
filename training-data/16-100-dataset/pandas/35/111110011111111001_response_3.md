The error is likely occurring within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class because the `PeriodEngine` object is not being properly initialized.

The `PeriodIndex` class has a method `_engine` that is supposed to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, but the current implementation is not correctly initializing the `PeriodEngine` object which leads to the error.

To fix this, the `_engine` method should properly initialize the `PeriodEngine` object and return it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` method will initialize and return a `PeriodEngine` object, which will resolve the issue and the failing test should pass.
