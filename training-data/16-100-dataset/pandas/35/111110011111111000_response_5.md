To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the appropriate `_engine_type` using the weak reference to `self`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

By making this adjustment, the function should correctly return the `_engine_type` with the weak reference of `self`, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
