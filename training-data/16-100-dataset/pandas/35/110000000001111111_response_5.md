The issue seems to be related to weakref usage in the '_engine' function, where the weak reference of the 'self' object is not being handled correctly. This causes the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly and that the PeriodIndex is being passed to the PeriodEngine as intended.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to properly manage the weak reference and ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. This might involve creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and passing it to the PeriodEngine.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self(), len(self._values))
```

With this corrected code, the weak reference to self is properly handled, and the PeriodIndex is passed to the PeriodEngine as intended, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

This fix should ensure that the bug is resolved and the function behaves as expected.
