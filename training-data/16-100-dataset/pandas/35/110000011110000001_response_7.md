1. The buggy function is a cached property called `_engine`, which appears to be related to the `PeriodEngine` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `PeriodEngine`, which is failing with an AttributeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_engine` function is not correctly returning the `PeriodEngine` instance, causing it to be `NoneType` and resulting in an AttributeError when the test tries to access its attributes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.
   - Check if the `self._engine_type` is returning the correct type or if it needs to be initialized properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced `@cache_readonly` with `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)` to properly cache the `_engine` function. This should ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` instance is returned when the function is called.
