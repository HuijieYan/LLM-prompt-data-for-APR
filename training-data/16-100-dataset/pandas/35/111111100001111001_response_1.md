The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the use of weak references and the `_engine_type` method. Since the actual implementation of the `_engine_type` method is not provided, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug. However, one possible cause could be that the weak reference `period` is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, you can try creating a strong reference to `self` instead of using a weak reference. This can be done by simply removing the `weakref.ref` and passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self._values))
```
By making this change, the function should correctly return the expected output based on the input parameters provided.
