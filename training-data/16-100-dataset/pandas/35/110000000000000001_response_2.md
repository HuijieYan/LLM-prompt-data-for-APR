1. The provided function is attempting to use a cache_readonly decorator on the _engine function, which is supposed to return an engine type based on the length of the object.

2. The potential error in the function is the improper use of the cache_readonly decorator, which may not be implemented correctly.

3. The bug is caused by the improper use of the cache_readonly decorator and the weakref, which may not be functioning as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to check the implementation of the cache_readonly decorator and ensure that it is used appropriately. Additionally, the use of weakref should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly passing a weak reference of self to _engine_type.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}

    def wrapper(self):
        if self not in cache:
            cache[self] = func(self)
        return cache[self]

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# using the corrected function
result = _engine(some_object)
print(result)
```
