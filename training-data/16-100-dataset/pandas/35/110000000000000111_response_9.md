1. The buggy function is a property method that is used to get the engine type from self. It seems that the issue is related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex which is causing the engine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) line, where the weak reference of self is being passed to the _engine_type.

3. The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to the error mentioned in the GitHub issue where all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels) raises an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the weak reference of PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and that it is still valid when used by the _engine_type.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    return property(func)

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

@cache_readonly
def engine(self):
    return self._engine

# Update the property to call the corrected _engine method
``` 

This corrected code includes adding a weakref to the _engine method and making it a property that calls the corrected _engine method. This should help in fixing the weak referencing issue and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
