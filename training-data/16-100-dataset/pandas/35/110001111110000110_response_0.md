# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

I have replaced `period` with `period()` in the return statement to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

The corrected code should resolve the attribute error reported in the failing test.
