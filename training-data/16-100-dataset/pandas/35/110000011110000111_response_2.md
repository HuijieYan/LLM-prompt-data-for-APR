1. The buggy function `_engine` is being used in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` when creating `idx2`. The failing test is trying to check if all levels of `idx2` are monotonic.
The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where the `_engine_type` might not be returning the expected object.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function:
       The `_engine` function returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which could be causing the issue.

   (b). The failing test and error message:
       The failing test is trying to check if all levels of `idx2` are monotonic, which fails with an AttributeError indicating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.

   (c). The GitHub Issue information:
       The GitHub issue states that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to verify that the `_engine` function is returning the correct object and handling weak references properly. It may also involve checking the behavior of `PeriodEngine` with weak references and ensuring that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            self._cached_engine = func(self)
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._cached_engine = engine
    return engine
```

This corrected code uses a caching mechanism to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the same result for subsequent calls. It also handles weak references correctly and stores the result in a cached attribute to prevent premature dropping. This corrected code should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
