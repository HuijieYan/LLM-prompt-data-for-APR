The buggy function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` but it is not implemented within the given code. The `cache_readonly` decorator is expected to handle the caching and readonly functionalities for the `_engine` function. The failing test is related to the `PeriodIndex._engine` method, which is expected to return an engine type associated with the PeriodIndex.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the expected result. It seems that the `self._engine_type` call inside the `_engine` function is not returning a valid engine object, which is leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the decorator `@cache_readonly` needs to be correctly implemented and applied to the `_engine` function. This will ensure that the `_engine` function returns the cached engine object when called repeatedly with the same input.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Corrected implementation of cache_readonly decorator
def cache_readonly(func):
    return lru_cache(None)(func)

# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With the corrected implementation of the `cache_readonly` decorator, the `_engine` function will now return the cached engine object, which should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
