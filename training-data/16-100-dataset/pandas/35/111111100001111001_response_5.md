The potential error in the buggy function is the use of weakref.ref(self), which is not necessary. The purpose of weakref is to create a weak reference to an object, allowing the referenced object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it. However, in this case, it is not necessary to create a weak reference to self.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the weakref.ref(self) and return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will return the expected output for the given input parameters.
