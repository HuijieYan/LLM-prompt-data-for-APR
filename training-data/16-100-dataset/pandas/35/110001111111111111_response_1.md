The bug in the provided code is that the weak reference `period` is not being used properly, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access the attribute `view` on it.

The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which is likely due to the weak reference not being properly utilized.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be passed to the `_engine_type` function properly so that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

By properly creating and using the weak reference `period`, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

This fix should also address the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs", as it resolves the issue of weak references being dropped prematurely.
