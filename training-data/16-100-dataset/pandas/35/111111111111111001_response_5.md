The issue with the `_engine` function seems to be that it's returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `self._engine_type` is not defined, which leads to the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix this issue, you need to define the `_engine_type` attribute in the `PeriodIndex` class. This attribute should reference the engine type that the `PeriodIndex` should use.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# define the _engine_type attribute
PeriodIndex._engine_type = PeriodEngine  # replace PeriodEngine with the appropriate engine type
```

Make sure to replace `PeriodEngine` with the correct engine type that should be used by `PeriodIndex`.

By defining the `_engine_type` attribute within the `PeriodIndex` class, you're ensuring that it can be accessed by the `_engine` function, which should resolve the AttributeError in the failing test.
