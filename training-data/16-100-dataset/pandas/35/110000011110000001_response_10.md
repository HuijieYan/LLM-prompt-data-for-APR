1. The buggy function is a cached property that is supposed to return an instance of _engine_type. The failing test function 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' is testing the functionality of the MultiIndex and it expects the _engine method to work properly. The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurred within the _engine method when trying to get the view attribute of a NoneType object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the line that returns the result of the _engine_type constructor.

3. The cause of the bug is that the _engine method is not returning a valid instance of _engine_type, resulting in a NoneType object being returned instead. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if self._engine_type(period, len(self)) is returning a valid instance or if it's returning None.
   - Ensuring that the correct arguments are being passed to self._engine_type.
   - Verifying that the _engine_type constructor is functioning as expected.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine instance")
    return engine_instance
```

By using a memoization decorator (cache_readonly) and checking if the _engine_type constructor returns a valid instance, the corrected code should pass the failing test.
