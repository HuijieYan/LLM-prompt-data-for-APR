The problem with the code seems to be that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` is created, but not used properly. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object it expects.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to revise the `_engine` method to appropriately utilize the weak reference to the `self` object. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a dereferenced weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With this correction, the weak reference `period` now correctly references the `self` object, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
