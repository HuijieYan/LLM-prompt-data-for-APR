1. The buggy function is using a decorator called `@cache_readonly` which is not defined in the provided code. The function is supposed to return the result of `_engine_type` function with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments.

2. The potential error location is the decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is not defined and thus causing the function to not work as intended.

3. The cause of the bug is that the decorator `@cache_readonly` is not defined, so it is causing the function to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the `@cache_readonly` decorator if it is a custom decorator and implement the caching logic within it.
   - If `@cache_readonly` is a third-party decorator, make sure it is installed and being used correctly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
