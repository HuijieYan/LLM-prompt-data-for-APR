1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle. However, it appears that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before it's intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the implementation of weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.
   (b). The related functions are likely dropping the weakly reference `PeriodIndex` prematurely.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that when using a MultiIndex and copying the levels, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it's intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until it's intended, and not dropped prematurely.
   (b). Adjust the implementation of weak reference in the `_engine` function to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not lost.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Keeping the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By retaining the weak reference `period` until it's intended, the corrected function should address the issue reported on GitHub.
