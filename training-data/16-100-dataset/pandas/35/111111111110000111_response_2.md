The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function returns the `_engine_type` with weak reference to self as a parameter. The weak reference is intended to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be causing an issue leading to the error.

The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The GitHub issue explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference `period_ref` throughout the function's lifetime, we ensure that the `NoneType` error will not occur when `PeriodEngine` is accessed.

With this correction, the failing test should pass successfully, and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
