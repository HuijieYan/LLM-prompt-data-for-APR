The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly creating a weak reference to the 'self' object before passing it to the '_engine_type' method. This can lead to a reference cycle and potential memory leaks.

To fix this issue, we need to use the 'weakref.proxy' method to create a weak reference to the 'self' object.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using 'weakref.proxy', we ensure that a weak reference to the 'self' object is passed to the '_engine_type' method, preventing any potential reference cycles and memory leaks. This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
