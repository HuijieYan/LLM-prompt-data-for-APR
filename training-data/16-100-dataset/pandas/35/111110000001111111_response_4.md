The bug is caused by the weakref not being passed to the _engine_type constructor in the _engine method of the PeriodIndex class. This causes the weak reference to be dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is passed to the _engine_type constructor along with the length of the PeriodIndex. This will prevent the weak reference from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By passing the weakref of self and the length of self._values to the _engine_type constructor, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the execution of the PeriodEngine.

This corrected code should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding copying of PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex losing weakrefs.
