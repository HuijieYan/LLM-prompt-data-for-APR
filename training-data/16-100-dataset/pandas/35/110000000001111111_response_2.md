The issue appears to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not being maintained properly, which is causing the `None` value to be passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is leading to the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be updated to properly maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By maintaining a weak reference to `self` using `period = weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly referenced and passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
