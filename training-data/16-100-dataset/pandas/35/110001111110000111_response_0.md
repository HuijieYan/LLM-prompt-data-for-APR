The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a PeriodIndex object. Then it calls `self._engine_type` passing the weak reference and the length of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex from period values and then check if all levels are monotonic.

The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError due to a NoneType object not having the `view` attribute.

The GitHub issue suggests that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference appropriately and ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is still available for use in the `_engine_type` call.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we get the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weakly referenced `self` is still available and prevents the NoneType AttributeError.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
