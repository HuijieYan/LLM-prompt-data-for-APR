The issue in the given function is that the `_engine_type` attribute is not being initialized properly. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute in the failing test.

To fix this issue, the `_engine_type` attribute needs to be properly initialized. It seems that the `_engine_type` attribute is expected to be a PeriodEngine instance based on the failing test.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period) if self._engine_type is not None else PeriodEngine(period)
```

In this corrected code:
- We check if `_engine_type` is not None, and if it is, we use it to initialize `_engine`.
- If it is None, we directly initialize `_engine` with a new instance of `PeriodEngine`.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
