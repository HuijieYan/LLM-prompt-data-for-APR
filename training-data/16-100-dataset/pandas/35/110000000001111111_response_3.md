The buggy function seems to be a part of a caching mechanism, as it is decorated with @cache_readonly. The function is intended to return an engine type based on the input parameters. However, it seems to have an issue with passing a weak reference of self to the _engine_type.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value is that the weakref.ref(self) is returning a weak reference to self, but it is not being used in the instantiation of _engine_type.

According to the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function should use the weak reference of self in the instantiation of _engine_type in order to avoid the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly use the weak reference of self, ensuring that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
