1. The problematic function is a method named _engine within the class PeriodIndex. It is a cache_readonly method used to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex object.

2. The potential error location is within the return statement of the _engine method, specifically with the use of weakref.ref(self). This usage may cause a reference cycle and could potentially lead to memory leaks.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weakref.ref(self) within the _engine method. This can potentially create a reference cycle, impacting memory management. The related functions, cache_readonly and _engine_type, are not directly causing the bug, but they are related to the problematic method.

4. To fix the bug, the usage of weakref should be re-evaluated in the _engine method. It may be necessary to use weakref.proxy(self) instead of weakref.ref(self) to avoid creating a reference cycle.

5. Corrected code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
