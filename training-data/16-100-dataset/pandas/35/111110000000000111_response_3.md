1. The buggy function is a method within the PeriodIndex class. The purpose of the function is to initialize the _engine attribute, which is used for defining the period engine type. The GitHub issue indicates that when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, weakrefs are lost, resulting in an error. This suggests that the issue lies with how weakrefs are handled within the _engine function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the weakref. It seems that weakrefs are not being maintained properly, causing them to be dropped unexpectedly.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is responsible for creating a weakref of the PeriodIndex object and returning the period engine type using this weakref.
   (b). The PeriodIndex class is meant to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time and is used to create a fixed-frequency PeriodIndex.
   (c). The GitHub issue highlights that weakly referenced PeriodIndex objects are dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None value instead of the PeriodIndex.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that weakrefs to the PeriodIndex object are maintained properly within the _engine function.
   b. Verify the timing of when weakrefs are dropped and make necessary adjustments to ensure they persist as long as needed.
   c. Validate the handling of weakrefs when used to initialize the period engine type, ensuring that it receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex object.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    ... (other attributes and methods remain the same)
    
    """

    # Corrected _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected code ensures that the weakref to the PeriodIndex object is maintained properly and is passed to the _engine_type for initialization, preventing the issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
