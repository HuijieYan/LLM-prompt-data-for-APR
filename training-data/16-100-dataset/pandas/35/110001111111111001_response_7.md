The issue in the `_engine` function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. This is likely causing an attribute error when trying to access the weak reference object.

To fix this, the `_engine` function needs to return an instance of `self._engine_type` without using a weak reference.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the weak reference and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will prevent the attribute error when trying to access the weak reference object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will now return the expected output when called with the provided input parameters. This should also resolve the failing test and error message.
