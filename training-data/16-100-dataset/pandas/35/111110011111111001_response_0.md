The issue seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is trying to access some attributes of `self._engine_type`, but it seems that `self._engine_type` is not being properly initialized.

The error stack trace indicates that `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class is properly initialized during object creation. Additionally, you should check whether the `len(self)` is returning the appropriate value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function should properly initialize the `_engine_type` attribute and fix the `NoneType` object issue. This should ensure that the failing test case passes and the expected input/output variable information is satisfied.
