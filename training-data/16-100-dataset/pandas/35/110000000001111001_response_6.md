The issue with the given function is that it uses a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is not a standard Python decorator. Assuming that it is meant to be a caching decorator, we should use `@functools.lru_cache` decorator instead.

The potential error location is the use of a non-standard decorator `@cache_readonly`, which is likely causing the function to not behave as expected.

The bug's cause is that the decorator `@cache_readonly` is not a standard Python decorator, and it is not clear what it is intended to do.

To fix the bug, we should replace the `@cache_readonly` decorator with the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator, which is a built-in Python decorator for caching the results of a function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
