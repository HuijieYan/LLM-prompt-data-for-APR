Potential error location within the problematic function: The _engine function is returning self._engine_type with weakref.ref(self) which might result in dropping the weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended. This is leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, causing the error.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function _engine is not properly handling weak references to PeriodIndex, which results in weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.
(b). The buggy class PeriodIndex may not be properly managing weak references, resulting in the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being lost.
(c). Related functions may be interacting with weak references in an unexpected way, leading to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.
(d). The actual input/output variable value information shows that the weak reference to PeriodIndex is not being maintained properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.
(e). The GitHub issue information confirms that weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being lost, causing unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _engine function to correctly handle weak references to PeriodIndex to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
2. Review the PeriodIndex class to ensure that weak references are properly managed and not lost unexpectedly.
3. Investigate related functions that interact with weak references to identify any unexpected behavior that may be causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

This corrected code uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self, and then calls `self._engine_type(period(), len(self))` to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and maintain the weak reference as expected.
