1. Analysis:
   a. The buggy function is a decorated with the @cache_readonly decorator, indicating that it is supposed to return a cached value and not recalculate the result every time it is called.
   b. The failing test is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check for monotonicity, but it fails with an AttributeError related to NoneType object.
   c. The expected input parameter is a PeriodIndex, but the actual input is a PeriodArray, which could lead to a type error.
   d. The GitHub issue describes the problem as weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. Potential error location:
   The error is likely in the _engine function where it attempts to use weakref, but it might not be working as intended, leading to a NoneType object being passed to the _engine_type method.

3. Bug cause:
   a. The _engine function is supposed to return a cached value using weakref, but it is returning an incorrect result.
   b. The failing test tries to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check for monotonicity, but it encounters an AttributeError due to a NoneType object.
   c. The expected input is a PeriodIndex, but the actual input is a PeriodArray.
   d. The GitHub issue confirms that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the implementation of the @cache_readonly decorator and ensure that it properly handles weak references.
   b. Verify the input type for the _engine function and ensure it's compatible with the expected PeriodIndex.
   c. Review the implementation of weakref usage in the _engine function and make necessary adjustments to prevent premature dropping of the weak reference.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, "_cached_result"):
            self._cached_result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
This corrected code ensures that the @cache_readonly decorator properly caches the result and handles weak references. It also ensures that the _engine function uses the correct input type and handles weak references appropriately. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
