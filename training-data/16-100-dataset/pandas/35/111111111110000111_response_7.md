1. Analyzing the provided information, it appears that the buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute on `idx2.levels`, which ultimately makes a call to `PeriodEngine`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'. The GitHub issue details further explain that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call, where the `period` reference might be getting lost earlier than expected.

3. The bug’s cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, passing a weak reference `period` to create the `PeriodEngine`.
   (b). This weak reference might be getting lost before it's time, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
   (c). The failing test calls `idx2.levels` which makes a call to the `PeriodEngine`, but with a NoneType object instead of a PeriodIndex.
   (d). The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a 'NoneType' object, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.
   (e). The GitHub issue details further confirm that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped before it is intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference `period` in `_engine` function is retained and used correctly until it's no longer needed.
   - Review the use of weak references and their interaction with the `PeriodEngine`.
   - Identify any premature deletion of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex and prevent it.

5. Here’s the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)  # Retain the weak reference
        if isinstance(period, weakref.ReferenceType):
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        else:
            # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid or has been prematurely deleted
            raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
```
With this correction, the function checks if the weak reference is still valid before using it to create the `PeriodEngine`. If it's not valid, it raises a `RuntimeError` to handle the premature deletion of the weak reference.

By implementing the above correction, the buggy function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, thereby addressing the bug and the GitHub issue.
