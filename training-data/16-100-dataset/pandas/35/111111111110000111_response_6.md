The issue seems to be related to the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. The failing test is trying to access the is_monotonic property of the levels in a MultiIndex that contains PeriodIndex, and it's failing with an AttributeError because the PeriodEngine is receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex due to weak referencing.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the _engine function so that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to handle weak referencing appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    return engine
```

With this change, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained throughout the _engine function, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
