Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `PeriodEngine` class where the values are attempted to be accessed from a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in a 'NoneType' object error.

Bug's Cause:
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning a weakly referenced `Period` object, but it seems that the weak reference is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `Period` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and only dropped when it's no longer needed.
2. Check for any points in the code where the weak reference to `Period` object might be inadvertently dropped.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Return a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case. Additionally, it addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
