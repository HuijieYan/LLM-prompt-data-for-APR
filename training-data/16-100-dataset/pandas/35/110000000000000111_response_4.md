1. The buggy function is a property function that is supposed to return the engine type based on the period and the length of the object. It is being used in the context of a pandas MultiIndex, where weakrefs are being used to prevent reference cycles. The GitHub issue is related to the loss of weakrefs when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self), as it is not correctly preserving the weak reference to the PeriodIndex.

3. (a) The buggy function is simply returning the engine type based on the weakly referenced period and the length of the object.
   (b) The GitHub issue describes the problem as the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is preserved throughout the function and any subsequent operations.
   - Checking for any places where the weak reference may be getting dropped prematurely and fixing those issues.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(func, 'cache'):
            func.cache = {}
        key = (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))
        if key not in func.cache:
            func.cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return func.cache[key]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly preserved throughout the function, and it should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
