1. The buggy function is a cached property called `_engine` that is designed to return a new instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the `is_monotonic` property of the `idx2` MultiIndex object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, specifically the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`.

3. The bug's cause is that the weak reference created within the `_engine` function might not be properly handling the creation of the `_engine_type` instance, leading to an `AttributeError` when accessing the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the `@cache_readonly` decorator to ensure that the caching mechanism properly handles weak references.
   - Implement proper error handling within the `_engine` function to handle cases where the weak reference may not be valid.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    @property
    @lru_cache
    def wrapper(self):
        return func(self)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Assuming the implementation of _engine_type is available and functioning correctly

# The corrected version of the function should handle weak references properly, ensuring that the cached property is returned without any issues related to weak references and avoiding the AttributeError described in the failing test.
```
