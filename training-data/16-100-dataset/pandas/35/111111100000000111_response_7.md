Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) line. This line is referencing a weak reference to self, but it seems that this weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function: The _engine function is responsible for creating the PeriodEngine, but it seems that the weak reference to self is not being used properly.
(b). The buggy class: PeriodIndex is a class that holds ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
(c). The related functions: The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling in the _engine function.
(d). The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes how copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs, which seems to be directly related to the weak reference handling in the _engine function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self is correctly passed to the _engine_type constructor.
2. Check if there are any other weak reference handling issues within the PeriodIndex class that could be affecting the _engine function.
3. Test and verify if the weak reference mechanism is correctly working for the PeriodIndex class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we replace the line using weakref.ref with weakref.proxy, which creates a proxy object for self that allows weak reference semantics to be used correctly. This change should address the issue of losing weakrefs when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
