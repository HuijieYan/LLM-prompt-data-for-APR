1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class, and it returns an instance of another class `self._engine_type`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `idx2` object, which uses the `_engine` function indirectly. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed when it should have been an array.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the return statement, specifically the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` part. It seems that `self._engine_type` might be returning `None`, resulting in the `NoneType` object that causes the error.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` tries to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, which should be an array or some kind of data structure.
   (b). The failing test tries to access the `.is_monotonic` attribute of an object, but it encounters a `NoneType` object instead.
   (c). The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of the expected array.

4. Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
   (a). Check the implementation of `self._engine_type` and ensure that it returns the correct type of data structure.
   (b). Look for any possible issues with the initialization or assignment of `self._engine_type`.
   (c). If `self._engine_type` is expected to be an array, make sure it's not returning `None`.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type cannot be None")
    return engine
```
In this corrected code, we explicitly check if the `_engine_type` returns `None` and raise a `ValueError` if that happens. This ensures that the engine type is not `None` and returns the expected data structure. This should pass the failing test and prevent the `NoneType` object error.
