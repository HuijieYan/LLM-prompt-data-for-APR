The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is a `cache_readonly` method that is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of `self` to it, but it seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the `view` attribute of the returned object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then tries to check if the levels are monotonic, which leads to an error due to the weak reference issue.

The GitHub issue suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, which is consistent with the behavior observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly when creating the `_engine` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(ref, len(self))
```

This code creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to the `_engine_type` class upon instantiation.

By making this change, the `NoneType` error should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue's description of the problem in losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
