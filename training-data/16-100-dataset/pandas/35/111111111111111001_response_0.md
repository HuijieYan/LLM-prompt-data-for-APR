The issue appears to be with the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and it seems that the `self._engine_type` is not behaving as expected.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_engine` function to properly initialize the `PeriodEngine` with the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

With this change, the `PeriodEngine` should be properly initialized, allowing the test to pass and resolving the AttributeError.
