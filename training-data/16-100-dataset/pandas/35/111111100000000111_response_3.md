The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function returns an instance of `_engine_type`, which relies on a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object).

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `None` being received instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type` so that it does not get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, `period()` is called to retrieve the `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that it is not lost prematurely. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
