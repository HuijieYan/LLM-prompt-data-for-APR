Potential error location: The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it is not being used properly.

Bug Cause: The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is used appropriately to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.
2. Verify the weak reference handling and make sure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Ensure that the weak reference to self is still valid
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance remains valid and is used appropriately to create the `PeriodEngine`. It also handles the case where the weak reference is no longer valid. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
