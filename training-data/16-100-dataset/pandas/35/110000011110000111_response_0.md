The buggy function is a cache_readonly decorator that is used to decorate the _engine function. The failing test function is trying to check whether the level values of a MultiIndex are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'view' attribute of a NoneType object, which is indicative of a problem within the _engine function.

The GitHub issue title and description suggest that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which leads to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of the self parameter is maintained and not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the implementation of the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that it is not lost.

Here is the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if "_cached" not in self.__dict__:
            self._cached = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cached:
            self._cached[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cached[func.__name__]
    return inner

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code takes care to properly maintain the weak reference and ensures that it is not dropped prematurely.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
