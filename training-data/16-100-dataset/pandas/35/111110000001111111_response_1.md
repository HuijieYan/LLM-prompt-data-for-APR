The issue here is that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance is not being correctly passed to the _engine_type constructor. This results in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance is correctly passed to the _engine_type constructor in the _engine function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to use the weakref module to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance, and then pass this weak reference to the _engine_type constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function that addresses the issue:

```python
from weakref import ref

# ...

# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period_ref = ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to the _engine_type constructor
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance will be correctly passed to the _engine_type constructor, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
