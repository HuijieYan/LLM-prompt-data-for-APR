The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly handled to ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to handle the weak reference properly and ensure that it returns the intended PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle being cleaned up by the garbage collector, use a weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With the above correction, the function should properly handle the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and return the expected output.

This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test passes, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
