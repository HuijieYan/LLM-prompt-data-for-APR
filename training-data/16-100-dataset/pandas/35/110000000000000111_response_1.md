1. The buggy function is a property that is using a decorator called `@cache_readonly`. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weak reference of `self`. In the GitHub issue, the problem is related to weak referencing of a `PeriodIndex`, where it is dropped earlier than intended.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak referencing of `self`. It seems that the weak reference is not being maintained for the intended duration.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped earlier than intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` it expects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained for the required duration.
   b. Check if the weak referencing is being dropped prematurely and make sure it is retained until it is no longer needed.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

class YourClass:
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained for the required duration by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and prevent the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` from being dropped prematurely.
