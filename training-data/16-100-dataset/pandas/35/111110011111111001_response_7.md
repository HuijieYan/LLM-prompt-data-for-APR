The buggy function in question is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.

From the failing test and error message, it appears that the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to access the `_engine` attribute, which is expected to be an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but is encountering an `AttributeError` as it is actually `None`. This means that the `_engine` method is not setting the correct value.

The `_engine` method is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, and the source of the bug is within the implementation of this method.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be corrected to return the correct instance of `PeriodEngine`. It is likely that there is an issue with the instantiation of the `PeriodEngine` object within the method. This could be due to missing or incorrect initialization of the `_engine_type`.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly to avoid reference cycles, as indicated in the comments in the source code.

The corrected code for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is as follows:

```python
# Corrected implementation of the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = PeriodEngine  # Initialize the engine type if it's not already
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` method should now properly return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and fixing the failing test.
