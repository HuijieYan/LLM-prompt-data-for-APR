Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function.

Bug's Cause: The buggy function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should actually be passing `self` to `_engine_type`. This is likely causing the function to return an incorrect engine instance.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now return the correct engine instance and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
