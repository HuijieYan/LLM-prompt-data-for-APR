1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator which indicates that the function results should be cached after their first call. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

2. The potential error location is the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This is the point where the weak reference to `self` is being created, and it may not be used correctly.

3. The cause of the bug:
   (a) The buggy function is using a weak reference to `self` incorrectly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the `PeriodIndex` object.
   (b) The `PeriodIndex` class inherits from `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`, and it uses the `@inherit_names` decorator to inherit names from `PeriodArray` and `PeriodArray._field_ops`.
   (c) The related functions include `asfreq`, `strftime`, and `to_timestamp`, as well as the `Period` and `DatetimeIndex` classes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the usage of weak reference in the `_engine` function to ensure it is appropriate for the context.
   - Verify that the weak reference does not cause any reference cycle or unexpected behavior in the `PeriodIndex` class.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    ... (same as before)
    """

    @cached_property
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `@cached_property` decorator is used instead of `@cache_readonly`, and the weak reference is removed from the `_engine` function. The function now directly uses `self` to create the engine, without the need for a weak reference. This should resolve the potential issues with weak references and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
