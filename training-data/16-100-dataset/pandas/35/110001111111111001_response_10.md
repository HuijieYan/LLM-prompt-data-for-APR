The issue in the buggy function is that it is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without correctly initializing `period`. This results in period being returned as a weakref reference, which is not what is intended.

The failing test is trying to check if all the levels of `idx2` are monotonic, and it fails with an AttributeError, indicating that the `_engine` is not functioning as expected.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, resolving the AttributeError in the failing test.
