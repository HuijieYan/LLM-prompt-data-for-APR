Upon analyzing the provided information, the potential error in the problematic function `_engine` is due to the weak reference to `self` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' when the test case is executed.

The problematic function `_engine` is a part of the class `PeriodIndex`, which is used in the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The error message clearly shows that the weak reference to `self` is not being retained as intended, leading to a `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in the AttributeError.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" also provides additional context, indicating that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` gets lost, leading to the observed behavior.

To address this issue, the potential approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is retained as intended.
2. Updating the logic to make sure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly retained when initializing the `PeriodEngine`. This fix should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case, as well as address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
