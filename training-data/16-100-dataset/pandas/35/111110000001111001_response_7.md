The buggy function appears to be trying to initialize the engine using a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly and is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to properly use the weak reference to avoid the reference cycle. We can achieve this by importing the `weakref` module and using it to create a weak reference to the `self` object when initializing the engine.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# Other parts of the code remain unchanged

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    (...)
    """

    # Fixed function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
