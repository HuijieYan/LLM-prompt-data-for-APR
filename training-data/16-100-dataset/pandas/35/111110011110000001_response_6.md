1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is used to initialize the engine for handling period-like data inside the index. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` using `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to check if the levels are monotonic using `is_monotonic`. However, it fails with an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` method is the return statement where it calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to initialize the engine type.

3. The bug is likely caused by an issue with the `self._engine_type` method not properly creating the engine.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Ensure that the `self._engine_type` method properly initializes and returns the engine type without returning `None`.
   (b) Check the implementation of the `self._engine_type` method to ensure it is functioning as expected.
   (c) Verify that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `self._engine_type`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Import the weakref module
import weakref

# Updated implementation of the _engine method
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
    return engine_type
```
