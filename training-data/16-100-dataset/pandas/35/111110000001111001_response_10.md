Potential Error Location:
The "_engine" function is trying to create a weak reference to the "self" object and then use it to create the "_engine_type" object. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly, which may be causing the function to fail.

Bug's Cause:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect usage of the weak reference "period" and the "self" object while creating the "_engine_type" object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the weak reference "period" correctly to avoid a reference cycle.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is properly passed to the "_engine_type" object.

Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference correctly to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
