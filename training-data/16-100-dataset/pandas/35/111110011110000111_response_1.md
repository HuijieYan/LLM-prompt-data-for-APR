Analysis:

The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message from the failing test indicates that the PeriodEngine gets a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The GitHub issue details the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which requires a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference handling may be causing the reference to be lost before reaching the `PeriodEngine`.

(b). The failing test uses weak references, and the GitHub issue indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is used by `PeriodEngine`.
2. Check if the weak reference handling is causing the reference to be lost prematurely.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain a weak reference to self
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Create PeriodEngine instance with the weak reference
    if engine_type is None:  # Check if PeriodEngine instance is None
        raise ValueError("Failed to create PeriodEngine instance")
    return engine_type  # Return the PeriodEngine instance
```

This corrected code maintains a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and passes it to the `PeriodEngine` during instantiation. It also includes a check to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is not None. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
