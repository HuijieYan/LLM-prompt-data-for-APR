The buggy function is the `_engine` method inside the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute 'view', which implies that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected output.

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference `period` not being properly handled within the `_engine` method. When the period index is only weakly referenced, it seems to be dropped before it should, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` should be handled correctly within the `_engine` method to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `period` is now a weak reference proxy of the `self` object, ensuring that the weak reference is handled properly without being dropped prematurely. This corrected code should resolve the issue and satisfy the failing test case as well as the expected input/output variable information provided.

Once this correction is made, the function should pass the failing test, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
