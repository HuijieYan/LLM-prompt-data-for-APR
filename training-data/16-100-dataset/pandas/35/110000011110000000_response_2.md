Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    pass

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Please note that the `cache_readonly` decorator does nothing in the provided code. It should be implemented based on the specific caching requirements.

Additionally, the failing test function provided is not directly related to the `@cache_readonly` function and may not provide clarity on the fix to the error message. It is recommended to provide a failing test directly related to the `@cache_readonly` function for a more targeted approach to fixing the issue.
