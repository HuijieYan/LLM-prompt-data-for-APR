1. The buggy function is a method within the PeriodIndex class, which is a subclass of DatetimeIndexOpsMixin and Int64Index. It is meant to create an instance of the _engine_type using the weakref of the PeriodIndex instance.

2. The potential error location within the function is the weakref.ref() call, which is used to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance, but it is not using the weak reference properly within the function.
   (b). The PeriodIndex class inherits from DatetimeIndexOpsMixin and Int64Index, and it is used to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. The _engine method is intended to create an instance of _engine_type, but the weak reference is not being utilized correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly use the weak reference within the function to avoid a reference cycle and prevent memory leaks.
   - Ensure that the weak reference is being passed correctly to the _engine_type.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters

    # The corrected _engine method with the proper usage of weak reference
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
