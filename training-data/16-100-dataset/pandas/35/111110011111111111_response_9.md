### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by the fact that the PeriodIndex weakly referenced object is dropped before intended. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a None object instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the AttributeError.

### Potential Error Location:

The potential error lies in the `_engine` function where it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference to self.

### Proposed Fix:

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled properly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine
import weakref

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object would be properly maintained, resolving the issue of the PeriodEngine receiving a None object.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, successfully resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
