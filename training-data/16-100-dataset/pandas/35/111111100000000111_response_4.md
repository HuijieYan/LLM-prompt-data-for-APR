Potential error location: The _engine function is using weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex, but it seems that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended to be used by the PeriodEngine.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function: The _engine function is creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex but not handling it properly.
(b). The buggy class: PeriodIndex is the class containing the _engine function and it seems that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being maintained properly.
(c). The related functions: The PeriodEngine is being initialized with a weak reference to the PeriodIndex, but the weak reference is not being utilized effectively.
(d). The GitHub Issue information: The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it is intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the usage of the PeriodEngine.
2. Properly handle the weak reference to avoid it being dropped prematurely.
3. Check the initialization and usage of the PeriodEngine to ensure it is receiving the expected weakly referenced PeriodIndex.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain the weak reference to the PeriodIndex
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure the weak reference is kept alive during the usage of the PeriodEngine
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the usage of the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
