Potential error location:
The use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to `self` is incorrect, as it should actually be `period = weakref.proxy(self)` in order to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)`, leading to incorrect behavior within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. Ensure that the correct `self._engine_type` function is being called and that its input parameters are compatible with the weak reference to `self`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
