1. The buggy function is a method within the PeriodIndex class, which is a subclass of DatetimeIndexOpsMixin and Int64Index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of "weakref.ref(self)" as an argument to "_engine_type".

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to create an instance of "_engine_type" by passing a weak reference of the class instance.
   (b) The PeriodIndex class is a subclass of DatetimeIndexOpsMixin and Int64Index, meant to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It is used for indexing and organizing time-related data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Remove the use of weak references and directly pass the class instance to "_engine_type" if possible.
   - Ensure that the creation of the "_engine" instance handles reference cycles properly, without using weak references.
   - Check for any other potential reference cycles within the "_engine" method and handle them appropriately.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class code)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Pass self directly to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
