The buggy function `_engine` is using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that it is supposed to be a read-only cached property. However, the function does not have a return statement, so it is not actually returning anything. This is likely the cause of the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to actually return a value. We can assume that the expected return value is an instance of `self._engine_type`, which takes `period` and `len(self)` as parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the function will now return the expected value, satisfying the provided input/output variable information.
