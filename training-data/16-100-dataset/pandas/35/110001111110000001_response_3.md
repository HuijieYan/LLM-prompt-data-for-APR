1. The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas library. It is being used to create an `engine` object of type `PeriodEngine` for the `PeriodIndex`. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to test the monotonicity of the levels in the index, but it fails with an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object, causing the AttributeError in the failing test.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the fact that the `_engine` method is not correctly initializing the `PeriodEngine`, which leads to a `NoneType` object being returned when accessed by the failing test. This is evident from the error message stating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', where `view("i8")` is called on the returned object.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object. This may involve checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` method or making necessary adjustments to ensure that it returns the expected object.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed for PeriodIndex")
```

This corrected code includes a check for `None` being returned by `_engine_type` and raises a `ValueError` if that happens. This ensures that the function never returns a 'NoneType' object, and it should now pass the failing test.
