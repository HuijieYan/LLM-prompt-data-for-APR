The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly initializing the `_engine_type` attribute. It should be initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and the length of the index.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly initialize the `_engine_type`. We will use `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and pass it to the `_engine_type` along with the length of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
