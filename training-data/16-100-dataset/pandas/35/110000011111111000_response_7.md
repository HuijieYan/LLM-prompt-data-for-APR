```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}

    def wrapper(self):
        if func.__name__ not in cache:
            cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return cache[func.__name__]

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))

# The bug was fixed by making use of a cache dictionary to store the result of the _engine function based on its name and then returning the cached value if it already exists. This will prevent the function from being called multiple times unnecessarily.
# The correct version of the function includes modifying len(self) to len(self._values) in the return statement, in order to pass the length of the values rather than the length of the index.
