The buggy function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly` which suggests that it is trying to implement a caching mechanism but it is not defined in the given code. The function is supposed to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` after creating a weakref of `self`, but it is not doing so correctly.

The potential error in the function is that it is trying to create a weak reference of `self` by calling `weakref.ref(self)` and assign it to `period`, but it should be setting it to a variable that can be referenced later.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly creating a weak reference of `self` and returning the result.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `weakref` module at the beginning of the file, and modify the function to correctly create a weak reference of `self` using `weakref.proxy(self)`. This will allow the function to obtain a weak reference to `self` and then return the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly create a weak reference of `self` and return the result as expected.
