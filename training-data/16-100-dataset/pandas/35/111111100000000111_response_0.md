The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` class passed as an argument.

The issue described in the GitHub post is related to weak references being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` as intended. This causes an error when checking if the levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic.

The potential error location within the function is the weak reference creation and its usage.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to preserve the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Preserve the weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Create the PeriodEngine instance with the weak reference
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure period is not garbage collected until engine_instance is used
    weakref.finalize(engine_instance, self._finalize_engine, period)
    
    return engine_instance
```
In the corrected code, we use the `weakref.finalize` method to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not garbage collected until the `engine_instance` is used. This resolves the issue described in the GitHub post by maintaining the weak reference until it is no longer needed.
