The bug is located in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems that `self._engine_type` is not being properly initialized or it's returning `None`, which leads to an AttributeError when the failing test tries to access an attribute of the returned value.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that `self._engine_type` is properly initialized and that it returns a valid object. It might also be necessary to check for `None` values before trying to access any attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when _engine_type is not initialized
        return None
```

This change will ensure that `self._engine_type` is checked for `None` before trying to create a new object instance with it. If it's `None`, the method will also return `None`, avoiding the AttributeError.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
