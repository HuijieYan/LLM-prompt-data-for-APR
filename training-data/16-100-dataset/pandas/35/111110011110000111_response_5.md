1. Analysis:
   - The problematic function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
   - The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` utilizes the `PeriodIndex` class and experiences an error related to weakref and `NoneType` attribute.
   - The GitHub issue discusses the dropping of weakly referenced PeriodIndex and the subsequent error.

2. Potential error location:
   - The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is potentially causing the error.

3. Bug's cause:
   - (a) The `_engine` function is intended to return the `_engine_type` with weakref of self, but it seems that the weak reference is not being handled correctly.
   - (b) The `PeriodIndex` class might be encountering issues related to the weak reference.
   - (c) The failing test experiences an AttributeError due to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.
   - (d) The GitHub issue highlights the dropping of weakly referenced PeriodIndex, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handling weak references within the `_engine` function.
   - Ensuring that the `_engine` function returns the intended PeriodIndex without any NoneType issues.
   - Refactoring weak reference handling within the `PeriodIndex` class to avoid dropping of weakly referenced objects prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:  # Check for NoneType
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
    return engine
```

By implementing these corrections, the _engine function should now correctly handle weak references and prevent the NoneType issues, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
