Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring when trying to access the view attribute of a NoneType object in the _engine function.

Bug cause: The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function.
2. Check for any premature dropping of the weak reference to self.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function, and it checks for the presence of the weak reference before accessing any attributes or methods of self. This should prevent the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
