The potential error in the buggy function is the weak reference to self being dropped before it is intended to be used, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to self should be maintained until it is used in the PeriodEngine, but it is being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to self needs to be maintained until it is used in the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to properly maintain the weak reference.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to self will be maintained until it is used in the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub problem description.
