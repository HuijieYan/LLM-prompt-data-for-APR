The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all the levels of a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic. However, it encounters an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `is_monotonic` property of the levels, eventually leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` getting dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The `GitHub` issue also describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly so that it is not dropped prematurely.

One possible fix for this issue is to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` within the `_engine` function to prevent it from being garbage collected. We can achieve this by using a `_period` attribute to store the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected function: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function to fix the bug
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self
    self._period = self
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will not get dropped prematurely, and the error encountered in the failing test should be resolved. This fix also addresses the issue described in the GitHub post, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as intended.
