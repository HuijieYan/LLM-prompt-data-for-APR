The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a `@cache_readonly` property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with `self` and the length of `self`.

The potential error in the function is with the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. This is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object in order to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not being used correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used properly, leading to potential issues with memory management and garbage collection.

To fix the bug, we should properly use weak references to avoid potential reference cycles and memory leaks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# ...
# other imports and code

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... rest of the class definition

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Correct usage of weak reference
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly create a weak reference to the `self` object, avoiding reference cycles and potential memory management issues. This will address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
