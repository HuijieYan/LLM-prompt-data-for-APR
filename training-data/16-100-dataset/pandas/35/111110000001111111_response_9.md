The problematic function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is intended to return a weakly referenced instance of the `PeriodIndex` class, but it currently returns `None` instead, leading to the error described in the GitHub issue.

The bug is likely located in the `_engine` function, where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None` instead of a weakly referenced instance of `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the weak reference not being properly handled within the function.

The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where weak references are being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to properly handle the weak reference to ensure that a weakly referenced instance of `PeriodIndex` is returned as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, `weak_self` is created as a weak reference to the `self` instance, and then passed to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that a weakly referenced instance of `self` is returned, as expected.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
