The issue appears to be with the `_engine` function, which is using the `cache_readonly` decorator. However, this decorator isn't defined in the provided code snippet, so we'll assume it's a custom decorator that is supposed to cache the result of the function. Additionally, there's a reference to `_engine_type`, which is not defined in the given code.

The failing test indicates that the `_do_monotonic_check` method is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the 'view' attribute. This suggests that the `_engine` function is not returning the correct type of object, leading to the subsequent error.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `_engine` function properly returns an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, which seems to be related to the internal workings of Pandas' index engine. This might involve implementing the `_engine_type` constructor if it's a custom class, or using an appropriate Pandas class or method to retrieve the correct engine type.

Here's a suggested corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_instance'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_instance = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_instance
```

This version ensures that the `_engine` function always returns the cached instance of `PeriodEngine`, and creates it if it doesn't exist. Replace `PeriodEngine` with the correct class or type based on the actual implementation in your code.

By ensuring that the correct engine instance is returned by the `_engine` function, you can address the issue with the failing test and ensure that the expected behavior for the given input and output variables is met.
