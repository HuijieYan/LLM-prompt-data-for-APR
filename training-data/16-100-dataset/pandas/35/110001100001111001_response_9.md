Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the weakref.ref() usage, which should take the object as an argument but is missing in the original code.

Bug's Cause:
The _engine function is supposed to create an instance of a specific _engine_type using a weak reference to self. However, the weakref.ref() function is not being used correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass the object self as an argument to weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to it.
2. Use the weakref module to create a weak reference to the self object.

Corrected code:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By passing the self object as an argument to weakref.ref(), we can create a weak reference to it and avoid the reference cycle issue. This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
