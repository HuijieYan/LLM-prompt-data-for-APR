The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `period.py` file of the `pandas` library. The function is intended to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance and its length as arguments.

The error location within the function is likely the weak reference creation part: `period = weakref.ref(self)`. It seems that the weak reference is not being properly maintained or utilized, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" provides a detailed explanation of the problem. The issue describes how using weak references within `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in losing the weak references, causing an error when checking for `is_monotonic` property. This aligns with the suspected error location in the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, the weak reference creation and handling within the `_engine` function needs to be reviewed. The weak reference should be properly maintained to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.core.algorithms import PeriodEngine
import weakref

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we import the `PeriodEngine` class from `pandas.core.algorithms` and use it directly in the return statement, passing the weak reference `period` and the length of the `PeriodIndex` instance as arguments. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained and utilized properly, addressing the issue described in the GitHub problem.
