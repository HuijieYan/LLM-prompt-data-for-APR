The issue is caused by the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This can be seen from the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` where the error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle weak references.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if the weak reference is still available
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer available")
```

By incorporating the check for the weak reference before using it, we ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex, thus resolving the issue. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
