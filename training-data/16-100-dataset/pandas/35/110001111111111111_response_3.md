The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object and its interaction with the `PeriodEngine`. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to an AttributeError.

The problem is likely caused by the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` being assigned to the `period` variable, but not being properly utilized within the `_engine` function, resulting in the `NoneType` error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly within the `_engine` function to avoid the `NoneType` error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to use the weak reference `period` properly to access the `PeriodIndex` object.

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, `period()` is used to access the original `self` object via the weak reference, ensuring that the expected `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the `NoneType` error.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, successfully resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
