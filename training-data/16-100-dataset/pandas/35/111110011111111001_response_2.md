The issue seems to be with the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is returning a value of `NoneType` when it should be returning a valid array. This is causing an `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic_increasing` property is accessed as it tries to call the `view("i8")` method on the `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, the `_engine` method should return a valid array instead of `NoneType`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).view('i8')
```

This change ensures that the `_engine` method returns a valid array that can be used to check for properties like `is_monotonic_increasing`.
