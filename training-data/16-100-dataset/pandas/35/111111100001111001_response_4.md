**Bug Cause:**
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the reference cycle and ultimately leading to a failure.

**Approach to Fix:**
Instead of using `weakref.ref`, the function should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
