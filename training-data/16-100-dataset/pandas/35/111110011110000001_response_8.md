1. The buggy function is called `_engine` and is a cache readonly function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test implies that the PeriodIndex `_engine` is expected to be removed, and the error message points to an AttributeError related to the `view` attribute.

2. The potential error location is within the `_engine` function, specifically the value being returned or the attribute being accessed from it, which results in the AttributeError.

3. (a) The buggy function appears to initialize an engine type with a weak reference to a period. However, it encounters an issue when accessing the `view` attribute.

   (b) The buggy class `PeriodIndex` seems to be related to the `_engine` function as it may be storing the engine type, leading to potential issues.

   (c) The failing test tries to verify if all values in the `idx2.levels` are monotonic, but it fails due to an AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute on an object of type `NoneType`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include thoroughly reviewing the `_engine` function to ensure that the correct constructor and attributes are being accessed. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the whole class `PeriodIndex` to check if the proper methods and attributes are being handled correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_engine`:

```python
from pandas.core.nanops import nanops

# Modified the function to avoid weak reference and solve potential issues
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    data = nanops.create_block_manager_from_blocks([])._is_single_block
    locs = PeriodArray([], freq=None)._index_with_goal_function
    return PeriodIndexEngine(data, locs)
```

This corrected code should still perform the necessary engine initialization for the `PeriodIndex` class while avoiding the potential weak reference issues. Also, ensure to remove the `_engine` attribute from the `PeriodIndex` class as the failing test implies that it's expected to be removed.
