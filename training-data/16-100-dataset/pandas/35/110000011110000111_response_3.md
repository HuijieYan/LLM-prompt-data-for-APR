1. The buggy function is a property-like function that is supposed to return the engine of a PeriodIndex. However, the function seems to be losing the weak reference to the PeriodIndex, causing the engine to receive a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the view method on the NoneType object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the weak reference to self (period) is being passed to the _engine_type constructor. It seems that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to it being garbage collected before it should be.

3. The error is caused by the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType object instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the view method on the NoneType object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to self (period) is maintained throughout the function's execution, so it is not garbage collected prematurely.
   - Ensuring that the _engine_type constructor receives a valid reference to the PeriodIndex, rather than a NoneType object.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def inner(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_value'):
            self._cached_value = func(self)
        return self._cached_value
    return inner

# Corrected buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

With this corrected code, the weak reference to self is now a proxy object, which ensures that the reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained. This should resolve the issue and the test should now pass successfully.
