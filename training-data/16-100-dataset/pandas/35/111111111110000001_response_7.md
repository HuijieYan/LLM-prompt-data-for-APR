1. Analysis:
   a. The buggy function is a class method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class.
   b. This method seems to be caching a read-only value, which might be related to the engine type of the `PeriodIndex`. It's using a weak reference to itself.
   c. The failing test is related to `PeriodIndex` and involves checking if level values are monotonic.
   d. The error message points to an attribute error in the `is_monotonic_increasing` check of the engine when `view("i8")` method is called.

2. Potential error location:
   The error seems to be occurring when the `view("i8")` method is called on the engine, which is a potential attribute that's either not being set properly or is being set as a `NoneType`.

3. Bug's cause:
   a. The buggy function is responsible for creating the engine type for `PeriodIndex`.
   b. The related function might not be properly setting the engine type or the weak reference.
   c. The failing test is trying to check if level values of the index are monotonic, and seems to be depending on the engine properly providing the values.
   d. The error message indicates that the attribute `view` of the engine is a `NoneType`, causing the attribute error when `view("i8")` is called.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the related function or method that sets the engine type for `PeriodIndex` and ensure that it's properly setting the engine type or weak reference.
   b. Ensure that the engine type is assigned properly and is not a `NoneType` when accessed by other methods.
   c. The failing test might need to be updated to handle the engine type being `None` or to take into account any changes in engine behavior.

5. Corrected code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Assuming this is necessary
    if self._engine_type is None:  # Check if engine type is not set
        self._engine_type = DefaultEngineType  # Replace DefaultEngineType with the actual engine type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Returning the engine type
```
This corrected code tries to handle the case where the engine type is not properly set and assigns a default engine type if necessary.
