Upon reviewing the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not prematurely dropped. This can be done by using a context manager to manage the weak reference and ensure that it is still valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    with weakref.ref(self) as period:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected function should properly handle the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. This will ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed, preventing the `None` reference error in the `PeriodEngine`.

This updated code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
