The issue seems to be related to weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being handled properly within the _engine function. It appears that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to a NoneType object error.

Here is the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference to self._values is properly obtained and passed to the _engine_type function to prevent it from being prematurely dropped. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure that the PeriodIndex is properly maintained.

This change should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
