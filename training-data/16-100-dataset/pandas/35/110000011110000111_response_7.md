1. The problematic function `_engine` is a method within a class, indicated by the use of `self`, which suggests it is part of a class. The function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which means it should be a property, but it is missing the `@property` decorator. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which suggests that it's trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` using `period` and `len(self)` as parameters.

2. The potential error in the function is the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` being passed as a parameter to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, indicating that the weak reference may not be kept alive long enough for the engine to use it.

3. The failing test calls `idx._get_level_values(level)` to obtain level values for each level in the MultiIndex. The error message mentions `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the weak reference `period` becomes `None` by the time it reaches the `_engine_type` function, causing the AttributeError.

The GitHub issue mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. The expected output is for the code to return True, indicating that the weak reference should be maintained until it's no longer needed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference `period` is kept alive until it's used within `_engine_type`.
   - Possibly use a different method of referencing `self` to avoid the weak reference becoming `None`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from functools import cached_property

@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this corrected code, the `@cached_property` decorator is used to ensure that the weak reference `period` is kept alive until the `_engine` property is accessed. This should resolve the weak reference issue and allow the function to work as intended, thus passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
