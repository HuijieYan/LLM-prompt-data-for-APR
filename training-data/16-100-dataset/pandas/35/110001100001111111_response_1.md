The problem in the provided function is that it returns a weakly referenced PeriodIndex, but the weak reference is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the weakref.ref() function should be used to create a weak reference to the self object, and this weak reference should be passed to _engine_type to avoid the reference cycle.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly uses weakref to create a weak reference to the self object and avoids the issue of dropping the reference before intended.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
