The error location within the problematic function seems to be at the point where `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`. It seems that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to the reference being dropped before intended. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. 

To fix this bug, the `weakref` module can be used to create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is maintained throughout the execution of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            self._engine_cache = func(self)
        return self._engine_cache
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

```

By using the `weakref.ref` and calling it immediately to get the weak reference's object, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it's being used inside `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
