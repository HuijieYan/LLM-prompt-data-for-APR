The buggy function is using a decorator '@cache_readonly', but this decorator is not defined in the code provided. The function is intended to return a new instance of self._engine_type, passing in the period and length of self. However, it is incorrectly using weakref.ref(self) to get a weak reference to self before passing it to _engine_type.

The cause of the bug is that weakref.ref(self) is not necessary in this context, and it is causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the weakref.ref(self) line and directly pass self to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self)
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
