1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the weak reference is not maintained properly after the function exits. This is causing issues when the weak reference is used elsewhere in the code.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the weak reference to `self`.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference not being maintained properly. When the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which leads to the error encountered in the GitHub issue. The `_engine` function is directly related to this issue, as it is responsible for creating the engine with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly throughout the usage of `_engine`, and confirming that the weak reference is not dropped unexpectedly. This could involve reviewing the lifecycle of the weak reference and ensuring that it is properly managed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if hasattr(self, '__weakref__'):
        # Ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained
        self.__weakref__ = period
    
    return engine
```

This corrected code creates the weak reference to `self`, creates the `engine` using the weak reference, and then ensures that the weak reference is maintained by assigning it to `__weakref__`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
