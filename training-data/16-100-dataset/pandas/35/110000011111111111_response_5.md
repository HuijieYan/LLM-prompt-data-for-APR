The buggy function `_engine` is a method that returns an engine instance based on the periods stored in the provided `self._values`. The function uses weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checks if the created index is monotonic. The test fails with an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

The expected input value for the function is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. However, the actual value being used is a weak reference to `self`, which is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the function `_engine` needs to return the actual instance of `PeriodIndex` instead of a weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a strong reference to self
    period = self._values
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By returning `self._values` directly instead of a weak reference, the corrected function will satisfy the test, the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
