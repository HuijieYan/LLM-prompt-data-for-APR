The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is decorated with `@cache_readonly` which suggests it is used to memoize the result of the `_engine_type` method. The `_engine_type` method likely initializes some kind of engine or processing object based on the input arguments. However, the implementation of the `_engine` method is incomplete and contains a potential error.

The potential error lies in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
This line is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used in any subsequent operation. It seems that the intention was to pass this weak reference as an argument to the `_engine_type` method, but that step is missing.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the `_engine` method is not properly utilizing the weak reference to `self` and is not passing it to the `_engine_type` method.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the implementation of the `_engine` method to correctly use the weak reference and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. This can be achieved by modifying the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
to:
```python
period = weakref.proxy(self)
```
This change will create a weak proxy reference to the `self` object, which can be passed to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
