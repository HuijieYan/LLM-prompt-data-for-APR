The buggy function `_engine` appears to be attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. However, the `weakref` module is not being used correctly in this context, leading to a reference cycle error.

To fix this bug, we can use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that a weak reference to `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`, avoiding any reference cycle issues. With this fix, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
