# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Fixed version of the function using lru_cache
@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

I have used the `lru_cache` decorator instead of `cache_readonly` to fix the issue in the function. Additionally, the `weakref` module should be imported for using the `weakref.ref` function.
