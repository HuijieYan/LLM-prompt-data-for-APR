The potential error location within the problematic function is in the _engine method. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

The bug's cause is that a weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and is maintained until it is intended to be dropped.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

This code maintains the weak reference to the PeriodIndex until it is intended to be dropped, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
