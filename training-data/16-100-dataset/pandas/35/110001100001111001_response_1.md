The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self). This is causing the weak reference to the period object to be stored in the weakref.ref() call instead of the actual period object itself.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is being stored instead of the actual period object, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to use the period object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be removed and the actual period object should be passed to _engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self._array))
```

This fix removes the weak reference and passes the actual period object to _engine_type, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
