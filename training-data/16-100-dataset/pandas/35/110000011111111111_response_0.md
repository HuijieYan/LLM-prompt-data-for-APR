1. On analyzing the function `_engine`, it appears that the function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing `period` and the length of `self` as arguments. However, the error message shows that the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. The expected input parameter values match the output of the function when the test fails.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` as it seems that `period` is not being passed correctly.

3. (a). The function `_engine` appears to be returning an instance from `self._engine_type` by passing the correct arguments.
   (b). The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert whether all levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but it fails with an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object.
   (c). The expected input/output variable information matches the actual input/output variable information.
   (d). The GitHub issue describes a scenario where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` gets dropped before intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid it being dropped prematurely.
   - Check if there are any issues with the weak reference implementation that might be causing it to return `NoneType`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, "_engine"):
            self._engine = func(self)
        return self._engine

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

By ensuring that the weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
