# The corrected version of the function
```python
import weakref
from functools import lru_cache

def cache_readonly(func):
    @property
    @lru_cache
    def wrapper(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return func(self._engine_type, len(self))
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, I added the necessary decorators and modified the `cache_readonly` decorator to properly use the `lru_cache` to cache the function results. I also fixed the `wrapper` function to take `self` as an argument. This should ensure that the function works as expected and return the correct values for the given test case.
