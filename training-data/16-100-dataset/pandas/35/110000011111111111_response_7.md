Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `_engine` function where it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

Bug cause:
The bug seems to be caused by dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended to be dropped, so the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Make sure the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before it's intended to be dropped.
2. Ensure that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Corrected code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
            self._engine = func(self)
        return self._engine
    return wrapper

# This is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Change the variable name from period to weakref_period to clarify that it's a weakref
    weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref_period, len(self))
```

By making sure the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely and the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex,` the corrected code should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
