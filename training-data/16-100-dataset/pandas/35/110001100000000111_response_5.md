1. The function `_engine` is using `@cache_readonly`, which suggests that it is a cached property. This function is related to the GitHub issue because it is involved in creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference creation and its usage in the `_engine_type` call. It seems that the weak reference may be getting dropped prematurely.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended to be. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. The weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is necessary to ensure that a reference cycle is avoided.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is maintained for the correct duration
   - Checking the implementation of `weakref.ref` and `_engine_type` to see if there are any issues related to how the weak reference is being used

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
With this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
