The bug in the given function is related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object. The function is supposed to return a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object, but it is not being properly weakly referenced. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be properly created and returned to the `PeriodEngine`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the `weakref.proxy()` method to create a weak reference to the `self` object, and then pass this weak reference to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object will be properly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
