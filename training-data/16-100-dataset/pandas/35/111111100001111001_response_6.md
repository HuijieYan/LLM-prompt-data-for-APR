The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a new instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as parameters. However, the weak reference is not being properly created, which may lead to a reference cycle issue.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to `self` needs to be created using the `weakref` module. This will ensure that a proper weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it along with the length of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. This should resolve the potential reference cycle issue and ensure the function behaves as expected.
