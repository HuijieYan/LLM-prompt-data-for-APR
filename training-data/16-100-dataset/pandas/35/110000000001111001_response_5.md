The bug in the provided function is that it is attempting to use a decorator `@cache_readonly` without the actual implementation of the `cache_readonly` decorator. This is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be implemented and the function `_engine` should be modified to use it. Additionally, the function should be modified to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cache = {}

    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if func.__name__ not in cache:
            cache[func.__name__] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        return cache[func.__name__]

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))

```

With the above correction, the function is now using the `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the value of `_engine`. It also correctly passes a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, as was intended.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
