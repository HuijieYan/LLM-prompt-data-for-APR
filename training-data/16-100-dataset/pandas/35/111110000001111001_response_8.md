The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that the result of this function should be cached and only computed once. The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems to be missing the definition of the `_engine_type` attribute.

The expected behavior of the `_engine` function is to return an instance of an engine type with the period and its length. However, based on the provided information, it seems like the `_engine_type` attribute is not defined in the `PeriodIndex` class. This could be the potential error location.

To fix this bug, the `_engine_type` attribute should be properly defined in the `PeriodIndex` class, and then the `_engine` function must use that attribute to create the engine instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this correction, it is assumed that `_engine_type` is defined and available in the `PeriodIndex` class. If it is not defined, it should be added to the class with the appropriate behavior.
