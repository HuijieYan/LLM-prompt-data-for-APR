The issue here seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex object being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be done by modifying the `_engine` function to use a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained until the `_engine` function is done using it, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This correction should ensure that the failing test passes and the expected input/output variable information is satisfied. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.

Finally, make sure to make these changes, contribute to the pandas repository, and create a pull request for review and approval.
