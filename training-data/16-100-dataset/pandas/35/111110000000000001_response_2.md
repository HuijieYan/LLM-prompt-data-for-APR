The buggy function is a part of the PeriodIndex class in the pandas library. The function is meant to return an instance of the _engine_type class by passing a weak reference of self to it, and the length of self.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the weakref.ref() method. This method returns a weak reference to the object, and when the object is garbage collected, the weak reference becomes invalid. So, when the _engine_type is eventually called, it may fail due to the weak reference being invalid.

The bug's cause is the use of weakref.ref() to create a weak reference to the self object, which becomes invalid when the object is garbage collected. This can lead to failure when accessing methods or attributes of the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we can directly pass the self object to the _engine_type instead of creating a weak reference. This will ensure that the object is still valid when _engine_type is called.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# The updated and corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
