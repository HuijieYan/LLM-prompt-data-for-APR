The issue seems to be with the `_engine` function, particularly with the use of `weakref.ref`. The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is defined as `weakref.ref(self)`. This is likely causing the error as weak references are not behaving as expected in this context.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` should be removed and the `_engine_type` should be directly called with `self` and `len(self)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

The updated code removes the use of `weakref.ref` and directly calls `_engine_type` with `self` and `len(self)`, which should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
