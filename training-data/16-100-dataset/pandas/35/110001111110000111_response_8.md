The problem seems to be related to weak references and how they are being used in the `_engine` function. The error message specifically mentions that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which means the weak reference is being dropped before it is intended. This is causing the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference correctly. We can create a new weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and use it within the function to avoid premature dropping.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained within the `_engine` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should now pass the failing test and successfully resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
