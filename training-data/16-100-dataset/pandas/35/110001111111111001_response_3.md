The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it's returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without actually assigning `period` to anything. Additionally, it looks like `self._engine_type` is a method of the parent class that accepts two arguments, but the weak reference `period` is not being passed correctly. This is likely causing the 'NoneType' object error.

To fix this bug, the weakref for `self` needs to be assigned a value inside the `_engine` function, and then this weakref should be used to call the `_engine_type` method. 

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly created, avoiding potential reference cycles, and then used to call the `_engine_type` method. By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
