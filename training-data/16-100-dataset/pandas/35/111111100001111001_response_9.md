The problematic function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly, which is causing the function to return incorrect values.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced, so it is not providing the actual reference to the `self` object.

To fix this bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference and use it to create the `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we are dereferencing the weak reference `period` by calling it as a function `period()`, which provides the actual reference to the `self` object. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected values.
