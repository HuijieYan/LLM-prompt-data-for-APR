1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property of the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`.

2. The potential error in the function `_engine` could be with the way the weak reference of `self` is being used or with the `_engine_type` itself.

3. The bug's cause could be that the weak reference of `self` is not being handled properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior when accessing the `PeriodIndex` instance.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve properly handling the weak reference of `self` and ensuring that the `_engine_type` is being used correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Properly using weak reference to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    # Ensure _engine_type is being used correctly (assumed to be a class or a function that takes 'period' and 'length' as arguments)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` to avoid potential reference cycles. We also ensure that `_engine_type` is being used correctly based on its definition.
