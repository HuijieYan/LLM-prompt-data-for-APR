The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement: `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue is related to weak references being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to use the `weakref` module and modify the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This will ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely, and the PeriodEngine will receive the correct reference.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self._values))
```

This modified code will create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and pass it to the `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
