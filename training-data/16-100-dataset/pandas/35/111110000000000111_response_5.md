1. The buggy function is a part of the `PeriodIndex` class and it is used to create a weakref to the `PeriodIndex` object. This weakref is then passed to the `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. The GitHub issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` resulting in losing weakrefs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the weakref is created and passed to the `_engine_type`.

3. Bug cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` and then returns the `_engine_type` using this weak reference. However, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
   (b). The `PeriodIndex` class is meant to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. Weakrefs are used to avoid reference cycles and maintain the integrity of the `PeriodIndex` object.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides an example where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained for the duration it is intended to be used.
   - Make sure that weakrefs are handled correctly to avoid losing references prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.internals import SingleBlockManager
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Create a SingleBlockManager with weakref as the data
    data = SingleBlockManager(period, fastpath=True)
    return self._engine_type(data, [])
```
In this corrected code, a `SingleBlockManager` is created with the weakref as the data, and then passed to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This should address the issue of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
