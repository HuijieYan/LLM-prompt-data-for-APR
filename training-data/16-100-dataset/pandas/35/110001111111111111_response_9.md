The issue is caused by the weak reference `period` being set to `None` before the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access it. This results in the AttributeError when trying to access the view method on a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be properly maintained so that it is not dropped prematurely.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use a class method to create the weak reference and then assign it to the `_engine` attribute. This will ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained for as long as it is needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    self._engine = engine_type  # Assign weak reference to _engine attribute
    return engine_type
```

With this correction, the weak reference is properly maintained and the bug should be fixed. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
