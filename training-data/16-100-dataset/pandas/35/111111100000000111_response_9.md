The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for creating and returning a `_engine_type` object, but it is using weak referencing incorrectly, leading to the engine receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is causing errors in the output, as described in the GitHub issue.

The issue arises because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is not being properly maintained, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring it is not dropped before it should be. We can achieve this by creating a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function to ensure it is not prematurely garbage collected.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to the PeriodIndex object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the weak referencing and instead created a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function. This should resolve the weak referencing issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` object as intended.
