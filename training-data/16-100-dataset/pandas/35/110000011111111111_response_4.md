The buggy function `_engine` is a property function with a decorator `@cache_readonly`. The function takes in a `self` parameter and returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with two arguments: a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the GitHub issue is failing with an Attribute Error, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs when the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` in place of a `PeriodIndex`, leading to a failed assertion.

From the expected and actual information, it is evident that the weak reference (`period`) is not being handled correctly and is not being passed to the `_engine_type` function as intended. This results in a `None` being received by the `_engine_type`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the weak reference (`period`) should be passed to `_engine_type` in a way that it retains its reference to `self`.

The corrected code for the buggy function `_engine` is as follows:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy to pass a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected code ensures that a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass as expected.
