The buggy function is a method within the pandas library that is meant to return the engine type associated with a PeriodIndex. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a 'NoneType' object while trying to determine if the index is monotonic.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that returns the engine type using 'self._engine_type(period, len(self))'. It seems that the 'self._engine_type' is returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected engine type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the implementation of the '_engine_type' method to ensure that it is returning a valid engine type, and handling the case where it returns a 'NoneType' object. Another approach could be to refactor the way the engine type is obtained in a way that avoids the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Handle the case where the engine type is None
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type cannot be None")
    
    return engine_type
```

By checking for the NoneType and raising a ValueError if it occurs, we can ensure that the engine type is always returned properly. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
