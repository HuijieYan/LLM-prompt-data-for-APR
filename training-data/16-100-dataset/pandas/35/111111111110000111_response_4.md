The problem seems to be related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses the `is_monotonic` attribute, which seems to be failing due to a weak reference issue.

The error message points to the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line, indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue also mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:  # Add a check for None
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("_engine_type is not defined")
```

With this correction, the weak referencing should work as intended and the `PeriodEngine` should receive the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

With this correction, the failing test should pass successfully and the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
