The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. This function is using a weak reference to the `self` object, which represents the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, this weak reference is not being properly handled, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The problem seems to lie in the way the weak reference is being used and dropped within the `_engine` function. It appears that the weak reference is not being maintained properly, causing it to become `None` prematurely.

To fix the bug, one possible approach could be to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is properly maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function. This may involve storing the weak reference in a class attribute or ensuring that it is not prematurely garbage collected.

Additionally, proper handling of weak references and their lifetimes should be considered to prevent this issue.

Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making these changes, the weak reference to the `self` object should be properly maintained, preventing the `PeriodEngine` from receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
