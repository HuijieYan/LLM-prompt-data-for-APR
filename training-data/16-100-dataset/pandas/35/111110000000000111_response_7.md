1. The problematic function `_engine` is within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`, and then pass it to the `_engine_type` to create an instance of something related to the period engine.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is with the creation of the weak reference to the `self` object.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The problematic function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`. However, due to the weak referencing methodology, the reference to `self` may have been dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
   (b). The `PeriodIndex` class is used to represent regular periods in time and holds ordinal values for these periods. The bug could be related to the weak referencing mechanism not maintaining the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object as expected.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weak references are lost, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout its required lifespan.
   - Validate the weak referencing mechanism within the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure that weak references are not lost prematurely.
   - Potentially revise the way weak references are being used within the `_engine` function to ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

5. Corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained and not lost prematurely, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
