The buggy function is a property that returns the `_engine_type` based on the `self` object. The failing test function is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it raises an AttributeError.

The error message indicates that for some reason, the `_engine` property is returning `None`, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The GitHub issue details the problem as a weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` object needs to be maintained properly so that it doesn't get dropped prematurely, and the `_engine` property should return the correct `_engine_type` instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            self._engine_cache = func(self)
            return self._engine_cache
        else:
            return self._engine_cache

    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is preserved, and the `_engine` property will cache the result of `_engine_type` and return it on subsequent calls.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
