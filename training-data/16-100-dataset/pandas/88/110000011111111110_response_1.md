Based on the error messages and failing test cases, the `pivot_table` function is throwing an AttributeError because it is trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, which doesn't exist.

The issue seems to be related to multi-index columns. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function works correctly when dealing with multi-index columns.

Here is a possible solution for fixing the bug in the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.reshape.pivot import pivot_table, _convert_by, maybe_downcast_to_dtype, _add_margins

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Rest of the function remains as is
    # ...
```

In this revised implementation, I added a check to convert the `columns` input to a list if it is an instance of a tuple. This will ensure that the function can handle multi-index columns properly.

After making this change, you can re-run the failing test cases to verify that the fix has resolved the issue. If the tests pass after this change, you can create a pull request with the fix for review and merging into the main codebase.
