The buggy function in question is the `pivot_table` function in the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The function is being called with the parameters `values="v"` and `columns=cols` in the failing test, and the test is failing with an AttributeError. 

Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to how the function is processing the `columns` parameter when it is passed a tuple. The error message indicates that a `Series` object has no attribute 'columns', which implies that the `columns` parameter is not being handled correctly when it is a tuple.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the `table.columns.nlevels` check in the `pivot_table` function, which is causing the AttributeError when `columns` is a tuple.

To fix this issue, the `pivot_table` function needs to handle the case when `columns` is a tuple differently, as it should not be treated in the same way as other column-like inputs. It should be processed as a MultiIndex for the columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):  # Handle the case when columns is a tuple
        columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([columns], names=columns)

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding a check to detect if `columns` is a tuple and converting it to a MultiIndex, we can ensure that the function handles this case correctly.

With this correction, the `pivot_table` function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected when `columns` is a tuple.
