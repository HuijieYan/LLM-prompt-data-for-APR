The problematic function is the `pivot_table` function, which is responsible for creating a pivot table from a DataFrame. The issue arises when the function is called with multi-index columns, leading to an AttributeError due to a check on the number of levels of the columns.

The cause of the bug is that when the function is called with multi-index columns, it tries to access the `columns` attribute of the result, assuming it is a DataFrame, but it may actually be a Series in this case. This leads to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code where the number of levels of the columns is checked to account for the possibility of the result being a Series.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check the type of the result and handle the Series and DataFrame cases separately. If the result is a Series, we can directly return it without attempting to access the `columns` attribute.

The corrected code for the `pivot_table` function is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Check if the result is a DataFrame
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        if dropna:
            data = data[data.notna().all(axis=1)]

        table = _add_margins(
            table,
            data,
            values,
            rows=index,
            cols=columns,
            aggfunc=aggfunc,
            observed=dropna,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            fill_value=fill_value,
        )

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return table
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case of multi-index columns correctly and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
