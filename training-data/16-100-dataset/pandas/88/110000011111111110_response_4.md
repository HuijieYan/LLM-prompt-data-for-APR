The issue in the code is due to the recursive call to the `pivot_table` function within the function itself. This is causing unexpected behavior and an AttributeError when attempting to access the columns attribute of the resulting DataFrame.

To fix the issue, the recursive call should be replaced with a call to the `pivot` function within the `pandas` library, which is what the `pivot_table` function ultimately calls. Additionally, the import and type hinting should be adjusted as needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot_table(
    data: DataFrame,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> DataFrame:
    
    table = data.pivot_table(
        values=values,
        index=index,
        columns=columns,
        aggfunc=aggfunc,
        fill_value=fill_value,
        margins=margins,
        dropna=dropna,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        observed=observed
    )
    
    return table
```

With this correction, the recursive call to `pivot_table` has been replaced with a call to `data.pivot_table`, ensuring that the core functionality of the `pivot` function from the `pandas` library is utilized. Additionally, the type hinting and header comments have been updated to be compatible with standard Python practices.
