The buggy function is `pivot_table`. From the failing test and error message, it appears that the function is returning a Series instead of a DataFrame. This is likely the cause of the error because the test is expecting a DataFrame. The input/output variable information also shows discrepancies in the type of the return value compared to the expected type.

To fix the bug, the function should ensure that it always returns a DataFrame, and not a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> DataFrame:
    # existing implementation...

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if table.ndim > 1:
        return table

    return table.unstack()
```

This corrected code ensures that the function always returns a DataFrame, and when necessary, it converts the Series returned by the existing implementation to a DataFrame using the `unstack()` method.

This corrected implementation should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
