The buggy function `pivot_table` is producing an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object. This error occurs when using multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case of multi-index columns properly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to be modified to handle the case of multi-index columns correctly. It should also ensure that the code does not attempt to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, as this is what is causing the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # please ignore the body of this function

    # Correct the handling of multi-index columns
    if isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(col, tuple) for col in columns):
        # Construct a MultiIndex from the list of tuples
        columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(columns)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code ensures that when multi-index columns are passed to the `pivot_table` function, they are properly converted into a MultiIndex object before further processing. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the function to handle multi-index columns correctly.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
