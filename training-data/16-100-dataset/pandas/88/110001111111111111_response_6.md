The issue with the buggy function `pivot_table` seems to be that it does not handle multi-index columns correctly when the `columns` parameter is passed as a tuple. This results in an AttributeError as the function tries to access the nlevels attribute on a Series object, which does not have a columns attribute.

The bug seems to occur in the part of the code where the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute is being accessed. This suggests that the `table` variable might be incorrectly assigned as a Series instead of a DataFrame when multi-index columns are used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the section of code where the `table` variable is assigned and ensure that it always results in a DataFrame, even when multi-index columns are used.
2. Add specific handling for multi-index columns to ensure that the data is structured correctly for further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)  # ensure columns is a list if it's a tuple

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

The correction involves specifically checking the `columns` parameter for a tuple and converting it to a list to ensure consistent handling further in the function.

By making this correction, the function should correctly handle multi-index columns and pass the failing test cases.
