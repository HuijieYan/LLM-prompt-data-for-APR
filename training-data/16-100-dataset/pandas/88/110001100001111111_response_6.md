The issue arises from the buggy function's inability to handle multi-index columns properly, resulting in an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object.

The cause of the bug lies in the section of the code that attempts to discard the top level of the table. The code wrongly assumes that the table always has multi-level columns, leading to the AttributeError when the table is a Series and not a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where the table is a Series differently from when it is a DataFrame.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # the following section handles the case where the table is a Series
    if isinstance(agged, Series):
        table = agged.to_frame().T
    else:
        table = agged

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

With this correction, the function properly handles both single and multi-index cases, and the AttributeError issue should be resolved.
