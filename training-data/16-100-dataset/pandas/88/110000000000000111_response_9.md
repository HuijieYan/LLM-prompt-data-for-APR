The buggy function `pivot_table` is meant to pivot a DataFrame, but it has an issue when dealing with multi-index columns. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns, causing an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the function is when it checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and tries to access `table[values[0]]` when `values_passed` is true and `values_multi` is false.

The bug's cause is that the function is assuming `table` is a DataFrame when it might actually be a Series in certain cases, causing the AttributeError to be raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle both Series and DataFrame appropriately. We'll need to check the type of `table` to ensure it's a DataFrame before accessing columns and levels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]] if (values_passed and not values_multi) else table

    # existing code...

    return table
```

This corrected code adds a check for `ABCDataFrame` before accessing columns and levels to ensure it's safe to do so. If it's not a DataFrame, the function will return the `table` as is without causing an AttributeError.
