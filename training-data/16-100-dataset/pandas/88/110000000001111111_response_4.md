The issue with the buggy function is that when the pivot_table function is called recursively with multiple aggfunc values, the table is returned as a Series object instead of a DataFrame, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

The error is occurring in the section of the code where it checks if the returned table has multiple levels in the columns and attempts to discard the top level if there is only one value for values passed.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the table returned by the recursive calls is always a DataFrame, even when the number of columns is reduced to a single level.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            # Ensure the returned table is a DataFrame
            if not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
                table = DataFrame(table)
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as before
```

With this correction, the pivot_table function will always return a DataFrame, even when called recursively with multiple aggfunc values. This should resolve the AttributeError issue described in the GitHub post.

This correction ensures that the expected input/output variable information matches the actual behavior of the function, and it resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
