The buggy function `pivot_table()` is throwing an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`. This error occurs when attempting to access `table.columns.nlevels` in the function. This suggests that the `table` variable is unexpectedly taking the value of a Series object instead of a DataFrame, which is not expected at that point in the code.

The function `pivot_table()` is intended to return a DataFrame, but the `table` variable is somehow being assigned a Series object instead. This is likely causing the subsequent error.

The failing test `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` provides input parameter values and the expected output. It appears that the issue is related to multi-index column cases.

Based on the source code, the failing test, and the error messages, it seems that the bug is related to handling multi-index column cases.

The potential error location is identified in the block of code that alters the `table` variable's value based on the condition `(table.columns.nlevels > 1)`. This condition assumes that `table` is a DataFrame, but it might be taking on a Series object instead in the case of multi-index columns.

To fix the bug, the `table` variable should always be a DataFrame, and there should be a condition to handle the case when `table` is a Series (e.g., by transforming it into a DataFrame if necessary).

The corrected function with the bug fixed is provided below:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    table = agged
    # fix for multi-index columns case
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()  # convert Series to DataFrame

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    return table
```

This corrected code checks if the `table` is a Series and then converts it to a DataFrame using `table.to_frame()` in the case of multi-index columns.

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug and satisfy the failing tests, as well as the expected input/output variable information.
