The buggy function is `pivot_table` in the `pandas` library, specifically focusing on the situation where `pivot_table` is used to perform a pivot operation when `columns` are passed as a tuple. The test case `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` in `pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py` is failing with an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` error.

The potential error location is identified in the `pivot_table` function where the value of `columns` is extracted and manipulated.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling the situation where `columns` are passed as a tuple correctly, leading to an attempt to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, which doesn't exist.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle the situation where `columns` are passed as a tuple correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code...

    index = list(index) if index is not None else []
    columns = list(columns) if columns is not None else []

    # Convert columns tuples to a list of tuples
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = [columns]

    # Rest of the existing code...
```

In the corrected code, `columns` is checked for being a tuple and then converted to a list of tuples. This modification ensures that the function handles the situation where `columns` are passed as a tuple correctly.

With this fix, the `pivot_table` function should now handle the case where `columns` are passed as a tuple, allowing it to pass the failing test.
