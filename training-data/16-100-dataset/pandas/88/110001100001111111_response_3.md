The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `pivot_table` function when handling multi-index columns. The error is occurring when trying to access the `columns` attribute on a `Series` object, which does not have a `columns` attribute.

This could be due to an incorrect handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. The function seems to be expecting a `DataFrame` object with multi-index columns, but when a single level of multi-index columns is used, it produces an error.

To fix the bug, the `pivot_table` function should be modified to handle both single and multi-level columns consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # existing implementation

    # check if columns is a tuple, if so, convert it to a list
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    # existing implementation
```
This modification ensures that the `columns` parameter is always converted to a list, providing consistent behavior regardless of whether the columns are single-level or multi-level. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
