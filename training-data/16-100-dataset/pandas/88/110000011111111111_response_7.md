The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the `pandas` library. The function is failing when attempting to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only.

Upon analysis, it appears that the issue lies in the part of the function that handles the creation of the table when multi-index columns are present. The code is trying to access `table.columns.nlevels` when `table` is a Series, which leads to an AttributeError.

The failing test and error messages support this analysis, indicating that the function is expecting `table` to be a DataFrame when multi-index columns are present but is instead encountering a Series.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to handle both DataFrame and Series cases when creating the table with multi-index columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `pivot_table`:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... existing code ...

    # Check if the table is a Series, convert to DataFrame if necessary
    if isinstance(agged, Series):
        agged = agged.to_frame()

    if (table.columns.nlevels > 1) and isinstance(table, DataFrame):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... existing code ...

    return table
```

With this correction, the function should now appropriately handle the creation of the table when multi-index columns are present, resolving the issue and passing the failing test case.

This code change should also resolve the GitHub issue titled "API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only".
