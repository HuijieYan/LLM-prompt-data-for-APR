Based on the information provided, the potential error location within the problematic function is when attempting to access the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute on a Series object, which leads to an AttributeError.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `pivot_table` function is treating the `table` variable as a DataFrame throughout the code, but in certain cases, it ends up being a Series instead. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where `table` is a Series differently from when it's a DataFrame. Additionally, the code needs to ensure that the `table` variable is always a DataFrame before trying to access its columns attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    # existing code...

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        if dropna:
            data = data[data.notna().all(axis=1)]
        table = _add_margins(
            table,
            data,
            values,
            rows=index,
            cols=columns,
            aggfunc=aggfunc,
            observed=dropna,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            fill_value=fill_value,
        )

    # discard the top level if necessary
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
            table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # existing code...

    return table
```

With these modifications, the corrected code should handle the different types of `table` variable (DataFrame or Series) appropriately and avoid the AttributeError. This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
