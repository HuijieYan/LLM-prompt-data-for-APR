The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The issue reported on GitHub is related to using the `pivot_table` with multi-index columns, leading to an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks for `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and then tries to access `table[values[0]]`.

The bug's cause is that when `pivot_table` is called with multi-index columns, it returns a `DataFrame` with a `MultiIndex` for the columns. Subsequently, when trying to access `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and `table[values[0]]`, it fails because in the multi-index case, `table` is a `DataFrame` and not a `Series`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include altering the code to handle the case when `table` is a multi-index `DataFrame` differently, or restructuring the logic to handle both single and multi-index cases uniformly.

The corrected code that resolves the issue is as follows:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # original code remains unchanged

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            # when both row and column indices have multiple levels
            table = table[
                table.columns.get_level_values(0)[0]
            ]  # select the first level of the columns
        else:
            # when only row index has multiple levels
            table = table.droplevel(level=0, axis=1)

    # original code remains unchanged

    return table
```
In the corrected code, the section that led to the AttributeError has been modified to handle the case when `table` has multi-level column indices. It selects the first level of the columns when both row and column indices have multiple levels, and drops the first level when only the row index has multiple levels. This ensures symmetrical behavior between rows/columns and single/multi case.
