1. The buggy function is a pivot_table function that takes several parameters and returns a DataFrame after performing pivot table operations on the input data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the recursive call to the pivot_table function within the if block where aggfunc is a list. This recursive call does not seem to handle the input parameters correctly and may result in an infinite loop.

3. The bug's cause is the recursive call to the pivot_table function within the if block where aggfunc is a list. This recursive call does not handle the input parameters correctly and may lead to unexpected behavior or infinite recursion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to avoid the recursive call altogether and instead handle the aggregation functions in a different way. One possible approach could be to refactor the code to use a loop to iterate over the aggregation functions and perform the pivot_table operation for each function separately, and then concatenate the results at the end.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = index + columns
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)

        return concat(pieces, axis=1)

    else:
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...
```
In the corrected code, the recursive call has been replaced by a loop that iterates over the aggregation functions in the list. For each function, the pivot_table operation is performed separately, and the results are concatenated at the end using the concat function. This approach avoids the potential infinite recursion and properly handles the aggregation functions.
