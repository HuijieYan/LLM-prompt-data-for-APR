1. The buggy function is a pandas pivot function that is used to reshape the DataFrame. The failing test checks if an error is properly raised when the 'columns' parameter is not provided. The error message indicates a KeyError caused by an attempt to get the location of a non-existing item, and this is the cause of the bug.

2. The potential error location within the pivot function is the condition where 'columns' is not provided and there is an attempt to access the index of 'columns', which leads to a KeyError.

3. (a) The problematic function 'pivot' is failing to handle the case when 'columns' is not provided, causing a KeyError when trying to access the non-existing 'columns'.
   (b) The failing test is trying to pivot the DataFrame without providing the 'columns' parameter, and it expects a specific TypeError to be raised, however, a KeyError is being raised instead.
   (c) The GitHub issue details that the error message is confusing and should instead indicate that 'columns' is not optional.

4. To fix the bug, a possible approach is to modify the pivot function to explicitly check if 'columns' is provided and raise a TypeError if it is not. This will ensure that the correct error message is raised when 'columns' is missing.

5. Here's the corrected version of the pivot function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected implementation, the pivot function will explicitly check if 'columns' is provided, and if not, it will raise a TypeError as expected. This will ensure that the failing test passes and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
