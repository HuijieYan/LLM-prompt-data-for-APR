The problematic function is a custom implementation of the pivot function for DataFrames. The failing test specifically checks for the case when the 'columns' argument is None, and it expects the function to raise a TypeError with a specific message. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to the KeyError in the pandas library code indicating that a key (in this case, the 'columns' value) is None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where it handles the 'columns' argument being None. This part of the code is not properly checking for this condition and dealing with it accordingly.

The cause of the bug is that when 'columns' is None, the code tries to use it as an index to create a MultiIndex, resulting in a KeyError when it encounters a None value.

To fix this bug, the code needs to explicitly check if 'columns' is None and handle it appropriately. One approach could be to raise a TypeError when 'columns' is None, as it is a required argument for the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the case when 'columns' is None, and it will raise a TypeError as expected in the failing test.
