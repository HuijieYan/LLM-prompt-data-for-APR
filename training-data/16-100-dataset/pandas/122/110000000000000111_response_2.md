1. The buggy function is the "equals" function, which is part of the pandas library. The function is supposed to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal, and False if they are not. However, it has a bug where it may incorrectly return True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. The function uses the "canonicalize" method to sort the blocks and then compare them. However, there may be cases where identical blocks from the two DataFrames have different locations, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

3. The bug's cause is that the function mistakenly assumes that identical blocks will always have the same location, which is not necessarily true. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue, where a simple test demonstrates the incorrect behavior of the "equals" function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the comparison logic to handle cases where identical blocks have different locations
   - Ensuring that the comparison takes into account all aspects of the blocks to accurately determine equality
   - Adding additional checks to verify the consistency of block locations between the two DataFrames

5. Here's the corrected code for the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            tuple(block.mgr_locs.indexMap for block in self.blocks)
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code modifies the "canonicalize" function to create a tuple of the block's type name and its locations, rather than just the mgr_locs as_array, to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not mistakenly considered equal. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
