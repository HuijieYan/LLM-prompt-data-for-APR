The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class. The failing test for this function is test_dataframe_not_equal, and it is failing with the error message "assert True is False". The expected output of the failing test is False.

The bug is likely in the implementation of the equals method, where it compares the blocks of two BlockManager instances. This comparison may not be handling the order of the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The GitHub issue title for this bug could be "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the provided information:
  (a). The buggy function: equals method comparing blocks in BlockManager instances
  (b). The buggy class: BlockManager with methods like _consolidate_inplace and as_array
  (c). The failing test and error message: test_dataframe_not_equal is failing with the message "assert True is False"
  (d). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value: The expected output is False, but the buggy function is returning True
  (e). The GitHub Issue information: The user expected the equals method to return False but it returned True.

To fix the bug, the equals method needs to be updated to properly compare the blocks in the two BlockManager instances. This may involve sorting the blocks before comparison and ensuring that the comparison takes into account the order of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the equals method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (str(x.dtype), x.mgr_locs.itm))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (str(x.dtype), x.mgr_locs.itm))
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```
This corrected code should address the issues in the buggy function and ensure that it behaves as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
