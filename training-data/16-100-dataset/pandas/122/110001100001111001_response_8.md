The bug in the equals function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect comparison of the self.blocks and other.blocks. This might be happening because the blocks are not sorted properly before the comparison.

To fix this bug, we can modify the equals function to first sort the blocks using the canonicalize function and then compare them. This will ensure that the comparison is done after the blocks are ordered in a consistent way.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified code ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their type and location before being compared, thus addressing the bug and making the function return the correct result for the given input.
