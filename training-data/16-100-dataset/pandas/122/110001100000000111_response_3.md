1. The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames for equality by comparing their axes, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames after consolidating them. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function fails to properly handle cases where blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to the function mistakenly returning True for DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
   (b). The related functions such as `canonicalize`, `consolidate_inplace`, and other utility functions are correctly implemented, but the issue lies within the implementation of the comparison logic in the `equals` function.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides an example where the `equals` function returns True for DataFrames with different block locations, which should actually return False.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly handle cases where blocks have different locations but are otherwise identical.
   (b). Potentially revisiting the `canonicalize` function to include the block's locations in the sorting order to account for different block locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and content because there might be identical blocks
    # with different locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block's content in addition to the type name and manager locations. This change ensures that blocks with identical contents but different locations will be treated as different, thus correctly addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
