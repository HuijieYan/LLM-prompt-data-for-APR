The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations and then tries to compare each block with the corresponding block in the other dataframe. However, the comparison logic seems to be incorrect.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could be to modify the comparison logic for the blocks. Instead of the `equals` method, the `block.values` should be compared directly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        (self_blocks[i].values == other_blocks[i].values).all()
        for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

This corrected version compares the values of each block directly using the `.values` attribute, and ensures that they are equal for both dataframes. This approach should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
