1. The buggy function "equals" is part of the "BlockManager" class and it compares two instances of the class. It first checks if the number of axes is the same, then checks if each axis is the same, then consolidates the two instances in place, and finally compares the blocks in the instances.

2. The potential error location is likely in the comparison of the blocks, as it involves sorting and using a custom "canonicalize" function to order the blocks.

3. The potential causes of the bug are:
   (a). The sorting and comparison of the blocks might not be working correctly.
   (b). The consolidation in place might not be working as intended.
   (c). The "canonicalize" function might not be producing the expected output for comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Double-check the logic for comparing and sorting the blocks to ensure it accurately determines equality.
   (b). Verify the functionality of the "consolidate_inplace" method to ensure it properly consolidates the instances.
   (c). Review the "canonicalize" function to make sure it generates a consistent order for the blocks.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array if block.mgr_locs else None))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array if block.mgr_locs else None))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the sorting of blocks is revised to use lambda functions to ensure it sorts based on dtype.name and mgr_locs appropriately. This should resolve any issues with comparing block equality. Additionally, "canonicalize" function is removed as it's redundant.
