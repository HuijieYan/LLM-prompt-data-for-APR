1. The buggy function is a method called `equals` for a DataFrame in the pandas library. This function is used to compare two DataFrames and determine if they are equal. The GitHub issue is related to this function as it is wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where it compares the blocks of the two DataFrames. It uses the `equals` method to compare the blocks, but the comparison is not taking into account the different locations of identical blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect comparison results. This has been reported in the GitHub issue and the expected behavior is for the function to return False in such cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve modifying the block comparison logic to take into account the different locations of identical blocks, ensuring that the comparison is more robust and accurate.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._reindex_if_needed(self.blocks, other.axes, copy=False)
    other_blocks = other._reindex_if_needed(other.blocks, self.axes, copy=False)

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now correctly handle identical blocks with different locations and return the expected results as reported in the GitHub issue.
