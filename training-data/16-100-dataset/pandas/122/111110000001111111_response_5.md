The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the ordering of the blocks not being considered when comparing two `BlockManager` instances.

The issue on GitHub describes the problem as `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `equals` function to consider the order of the blocks when comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version takes into account the ordering of the blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, which should resolve the bug. This fix aligns with the expected input/output variable information and successfully addresses the issue posted on GitHub.
