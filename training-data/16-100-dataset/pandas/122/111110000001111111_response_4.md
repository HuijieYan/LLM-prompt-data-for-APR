Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the sorting of the blocks using the "canonicalize" function. The function is meant to sort the blocks based on their type name and location, but the sorting may not be working as expected.

Bug cause: The function seems to be incorrectly sorting the blocks, which leads to incorrect comparison results and the function returning True when it should return False.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the "canonicalize" function to correctly sort the blocks based on their type name and location.
2. Ensure that the sorting logic is consistent and returns the expected order for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to correctly sort the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code update includes a modification to the "canonicalize" function to sort the blocks based on their type and location, ensuring consistent and correct comparison results.

The corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
