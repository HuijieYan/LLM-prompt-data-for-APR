Based on the provided information, the bug is likely caused by the function equals in the BlockManager class. The function is expected to check whether two BlockManager objects are equal, but the comparison fails when the blocks within the BlockManager have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class to correctly consider the block locations when sorting the blocks. This will ensure that the comparison between two BlockManager objects is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class members)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Updated canonicalize function to consider block locations
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.tolist()))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this change, the equals function should now correctly compare two BlockManager objects, taking into account the locations of the blocks.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
