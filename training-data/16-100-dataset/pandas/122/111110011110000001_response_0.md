1. The buggy function is a method within the `BlockManager` class in the Pandas library. It is called `equals` and is meant to check if two BlockManager objects are equal based on their axes and blocks. The failing test is a part of the Pandas test suite and checks if two DataFrames are not equal, which should return True, but it fails with an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely with the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` and the comparison using the `equals` method. 

3. (a). The buggy function `equals` attempts to compare two BlockManager objects by first checking their axes for equality, then consolidating the internal data using the `_consolidate_inplace` method, sorting and canonicalizing the blocks, and finally comparing the blocks using the `equals` method. 
   (b). The `BlockManager` class contains the `equals` method along with other methods like `_consolidate_inplace`.
   (c). The failing test attempts to assert that two DataFrames are not equal, but it fails due to a comparison returning True instead of False.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve checking whether the sorting and canonicalization of the blocks is done correctly, if the comparison using `equals` is accurate, or if the consolidation of data is affecting the comparison.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Please note that the correction includes converting `block.mgr_locs` to a tuple in the `canonicalize` function and comparing the tuples in the `equals` method. This correction should address the potential issues with sorting and canonicalization of the blocks, and the comparison using the `equals` method.
