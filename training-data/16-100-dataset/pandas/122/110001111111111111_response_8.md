The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This is causing the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` to incorrectly assert that `df1.equals(df2) is False`.

The key problem here seems to be with the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The current implementation does not consider the actual values and types of the blocks when sorting, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual block values and types when sorting. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct variables are used inside the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtypes)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we modified the `canonicalize` function to consider both the values and data types of the blocks when sorting. This ensures that the comparison within the `equals` function takes into account the actual content of the blocks.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
