The buggy function `equals` is comparing two objects for equality. It first checks if the number of axes (dimensions) of the objects are the same, then it compares the axes and the blocks of the two objects. The potential error location within the function is likely in the comparison of the blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the blocks is not taking into account the ordering of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but the original comparison does not take this ordering into account.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks needs to consider the ordering obtained from the `canonicalize` function. One possible approach is to modify the comparison of the blocks to incorporate the ordering obtained from sorting the blocks in the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of the blocks considers the ordering obtained from sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the ordering of the blocks and should fix the bug.
