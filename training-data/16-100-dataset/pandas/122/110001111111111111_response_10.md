The problem with the buggy function is that it does not take into account the block locations when comparing two BlockManager objects in the equals function. This leads to the function returning True when it should actually return False, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the equals function to consider the block locations when comparing the blocks in the BlockManager objects.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the equals function should now compare the block locations when determining equality, ensuring that the failing test is passed.

The corrected code also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
