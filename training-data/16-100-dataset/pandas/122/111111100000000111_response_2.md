1. The buggy function "equals" is a part of the BlockManager class in the pandas/core/internals/managers.py file. This class is used to manage labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays and is not a public API class. The equals function compares two instances of BlockManager for equality by checking the equality of their axes, blocks, and other attributes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks from two BlockManager instances using the "equals" method. The current implementation does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks having different locations, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" in the BlockManager class compares the blocks of two instances without considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.
   (b). The BlockManager class is designed to manage 2D mixed-type ndarrays and provides methods to manipulate data.
   (c). The related functions include "canonicalize" to standardize the block order and various other internal methods.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information indicates that the "equals" function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the "equals" function to compare the content of blocks instead of their locations.
   (b). Create a method to standardize the block order and use it before comparing the blocks.
   (c). Ensure that identical blocks with different locations are handled appropriately to avoid incorrect equality checks.

5. Corrected code for the "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_content(block):
        return block.values

    self_block_content = [get_block_content(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_content = [get_block_content(block) for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_content, other_block_content[i])
        for i, block_content in enumerate(self_block_content)
    )
```

The corrected code compares the content of blocks using NumPy's `np.array_equal` method to determine equality, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are handled correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
