The bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison logic is not accurate when the blocks are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes that are not equal, but the buggy function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

To fix this bug, the logic for comparing the blocks of data should be revised. Instead of directly comparing the sorted blocks, the correct approach would be to compare the sorted blocks against each other.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # revised comparison logic for self.blocks and other.blocks
    self_loc_blocks = sorted(zip(self.blocks, self.items), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_loc_blocks = sorted(zip(other.blocks, other.items), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[0].mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(b1.equals(b2) for (b1, _), (b2, _) in zip(self_loc_blocks, other_loc_blocks))
```

This revised logic will correctly compare the blocks based on their data type name and the manager locations. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result for the failing test.

With this correction, the `equals` function should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
