The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The failing test is trying to compare two different DataFrames and expects the `equals` function to return False, but it returns True instead.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` attributes of the `BlockManager` class. The attributes are being compared for equality, and if they are not equal, the function should return False. However, the comparison logic is not taking into account the individual elements of the axes to correctly determine equality.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for `self_axes` and `other_axes` needs to be updated to correctly compare the individual elements of the axes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code compares each pair of `self_axes` and `other_axes` elements using the `equals` method to determine their equality, and only returns False if any of them are not equal. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected result for the failing test.
