1. The buggy function is a method called "equals" within the "BlockManager" class in the "pandas/core/internals/managers.py" file. This class is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The "equals" method is responsible for checking if two BlockManagers are equal. The function first checks if the axes of the two BlockManagers are equal in length, and if not, returns False. Then, it checks if the axes are equal using the "equals" method of the axes, and if not, returns False. Next, it consolidates both BlockManagers in place using the "_consolidate_inplace" method, and then it compares the blocks within the BlockManagers. The bug causes the comparison of the blocks to return True even when the blocks are identical but have different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the comparison of the blocks after they have been sorted using the "canonicalize" function. The bug may be in the comparison logic of the sorted blocks.

3. The buggy function `equals` compares the BlockManagers based on the content of their blocks. It calls the `_consolidate_inplace` method on both BlockManagers before comparing the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks for comparison. The bug causes the comparison to return True even if the blocks within the BlockManagers are identical but have different locations. The GitHub issue provides a code sample where the `equals` method incorrectly returns True for two DataFrames with different data but the same column names.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Refactor the comparison logic of the sorted blocks to correctly identify when the blocks are not equal, even if their locations differ.
   - Double-check the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks within the `equals` method to ensure it accurately reflects the equality of the BlockManagers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values._ndarray_values.tobytes(), block.values._ndarray_values.tolist())
        # Modify canonicalize function to include the values as bytes and list
        
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code modifies the `canonicalize` function to include the values of the blocks as bytes and list. This modification ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks and their locations, accurately reflecting the equality of the BlockManagers.
