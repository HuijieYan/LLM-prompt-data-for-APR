1. The buggy function is a part of the DataFrame class in pandas library, and it is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. The GitHub issue indicates that the function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the 'equals' method.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This results in the function returning True when it should actually return False. The issue posted on GitHub includes a code sample that demonstrates this unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic to ensure that the function accurately compares blocks with different locations.
   - Update the canonicalize function to use a more appropriate method for distinguishing blocks.
   - Handle unconsolidated blocks (such as Categorical) in a way that ensures they are properly compared.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected function includes changes to the canonicalize function to use the type name and values of the block for distinguishing blocks. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different locations are appropriately compared.
