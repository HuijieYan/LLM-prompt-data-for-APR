The issue in the buggy function is within the `canonicalize` function, which has a different signature for the one defined within the class BlockManager. This is causing the `canonicalize` function within the BlockManager class to be unused, leading to unexpected behavior.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is caused by the incorrect definition of the `canonicalize` function within the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function within the BlockManager class should be modified to have the correct signature and functionality. Additionally, the `_consolidate_inplace` function should be used in the correct manner within the `equals` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.get_values().__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
  
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(
        block.indexer_equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, successfully resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
