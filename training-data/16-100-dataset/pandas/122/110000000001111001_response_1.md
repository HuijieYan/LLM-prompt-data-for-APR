The bug in the function is likely caused by the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. The expected output for `block.dtype` is `dtype('int64')`, but it is not being used in the comparison. Additionally, the comparison of `block.mgr_locs` also seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should use the `dtype` and `mgr_locs` values in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.dtype == oblock.dtype and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
