The bug in the equals() function is causing it to return True even when the blocks have different locations. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user expected the equals() function to return False for two dataframes with identical blocks but different locations, but the function returned True instead.

Upon analyzing the function and the input/output variable information, it is clear that the discrepancy arises due to the comparison of blocks without considering their locations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks without canonicalizing their locations.

The bug's cause is that the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them, leading to the incorrect output that the dataframes are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to consider the block's locations as well. This will ensure that blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_slice()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the block locations are considered when comparing the blocks, thus addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the problem of the equals() function returning True for dataframes with identical blocks but different locations.
