1. The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames based on their axes, blocks, and block locations to determine if they are equal. It also calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function to handle unconsolidated blocks. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error within the problematic function lies in the comparison of block locations using the `canonicalize` function. If the block locations are not identical, the function will inaccurately return True.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` incorrectly compares the block locations of identical blocks, leading to a False negative in the comparison.
   (b). This behavior is influenced by the `canonicalize` function, which orders and compares blocks based on their type and manager locations.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample and the expected output, demonstrating that the `equals` function returns an incorrect result for identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Revise the logic within the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks solely based on their content, ignoring their locations.
   - Implement a new comparison method that ignores block locations when determining equality.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based solely on their content
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.tolist() == block2.values.tolist()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tolist())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tolist())
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By revising the comparison logic to focus solely on the content of the blocks within the DataFrames, the corrected function should now return the expected output in the GitHub issue.
