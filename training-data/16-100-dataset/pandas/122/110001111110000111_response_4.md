The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames to check if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to assert that two DataFrames with different values are not equal, but the assertion fails with an error message `assert True is False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely in the comparison of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, but the sorting may not accurately identify the differences between the two DataFrames.

The bug's cause is a discrepancy in the sorting of the blocks, leading to incorrect equality comparison between the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to change how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality. We should find a more suitable approach to identify the differences between the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare blocks directly to identify differences
    for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function will accurately compare the blocks of the two DataFrames and return the correct result. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
