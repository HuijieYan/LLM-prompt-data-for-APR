The issue with the buggy function `equals` seems to be related to the canonicalization of the blocks. The function is incorrectly comparing if two blocks are equal by len. We need to revise the comparison method for blocks.

The expected output should be `False` since the location of the blocks is different, even though the content is the same.

To fix this bug, we need to compare blocks based on their content, rather than their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values.tostring())

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we sort the blocks based on their values using the `tostring` method, which converts the values of the block to a string. This ensures that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their location.

This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide the expected output for the failing test case.
