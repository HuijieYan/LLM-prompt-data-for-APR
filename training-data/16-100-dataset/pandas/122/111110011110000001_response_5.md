The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class. It seems that this function is responsible for checking the equality of two instances of BlockManager. The failing test, test_dataframe_not_equal(), creates two DataFrames, df1 and df2, and then asserts that df1.equals(df2) is False. However, the current implementation of the equals method is resulting in an assertion error.

The potential error locations within the equals method are:
1. The comparison of axes using equals method without any previous indication that self_axes and other_axes have such a method.
2. The use of 'blocks' attribute without such an attribute being directly found in the code.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect comparisons and sorting of block elements within the equals function. The error message confirms that the problem lies within the equals function and that the comparison results in True instead of False, contradicting the expected behavior specified in the failing test.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking if self_axes and other_axes have an equals method before using it.
2. Verifying the existence of the 'blocks' attribute and understanding how it is used within the context of the equals function.
3. Re-evaluating the sorting and comparison logic for the block elements.

Here is the corrected code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if any(not ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, list(block.items))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
With this corrected code, the equals function should now handle the comparison and sorting of block elements properly, passing the failing test.
