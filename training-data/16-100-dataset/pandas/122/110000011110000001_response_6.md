1. The buggy function, `equals`, compares two dataframes to determine if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the actual data within the dataframes.

3. The bug is caused by the comparison of dataframes being done at a block level, rather than at a value level. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning True instead of False, which is not the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Iterate through the dataframes at a value level and compare the individual values rather than using the block level comparison.
   - Sort and compare the values within the dataframes to ensure they match.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_values = self.values.flatten()
    other_values = other.values.flatten()
    
    if len(self_values) != len(other_values):
        return False
    
    return all(x == y for x, y in zip(self_values, other_values))
```

This corrected `equals` function compares the flattened values of the dataframes `self` and `other` and checks if they are equal. This should address the issue with the buggy function and make it pass the failing test.
