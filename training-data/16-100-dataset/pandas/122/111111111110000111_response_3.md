Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue lies within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. However, due to a bug, it is returning incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method, as the bug is causing it to return incorrect results.

The bug's cause:

(a). The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares blocks using the `equals` method, which is resulting in incorrect comparisons and hence the incorrect result.

(b). The `BlockManager` class contains the `equals` function, along with other related functions such as `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` which are called by the buggy function.

(c). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values and then checks if `df1.equals(df2)` is False, which is expected. However, the current buggy implementation of the `equals` function is causing the test to fail.

(d). The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because it is returning `True` instead of `False`.

(e). The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the `equals` function is returning the incorrect result. The expected output is `False`, but the function is returning `True`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks of the `BlockManager` instance.
2. Ensure that the comparison accounts for identical blocks with different locations, as this is the specific issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code modifies the comparison logic by implementing the `canonicalize` function to accurately compare the blocks based on their types and location tuples. This implementation should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
