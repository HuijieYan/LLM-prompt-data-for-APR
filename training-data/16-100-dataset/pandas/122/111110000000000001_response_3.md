1. The buggy function "equals" is a method within the "BlockManager" class. The purpose of this function is to check if two instances of the BlockManager class are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function then proceeds to sort and compare the blocks based on their type and management locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the sorting and comparison of the blocks, as well as the comparison of axes.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function incorrectly compares the blocks and axes and does not handle the comparison properly, leading to inaccurate results when checking for equality between two BlockManager instances.
   (b) The buggy class contains other methods that the buggy function relies on, such as "_consolidate_inplace" and "canonicalize", which are called within the "equals" method. If these methods are not functioning correctly, it can lead to inaccurate comparisons.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the comparison of axes is done accurately and efficiently.
   - Correct any issues within the sorting and comparison of blocks.
   - Verify that the supporting methods such as "_consolidate_inplace" and "canonicalize" are working properly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate inplace before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the function now properly consolidates the data before comparison. The comparison of axes and blocks has also been updated to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the canonicalization of block order has been maintained, and the function should now provide accurate results for checking equality between two BlockManager instances.
