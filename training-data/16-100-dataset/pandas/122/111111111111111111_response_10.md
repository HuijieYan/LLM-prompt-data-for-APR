The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which is not defined correctly for the `Block` class.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined within the `Block` class. Additionally, the usage of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be changed to `block.mgr_locs` within the `canonicalize` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Define the canonicalize function within the Block class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
