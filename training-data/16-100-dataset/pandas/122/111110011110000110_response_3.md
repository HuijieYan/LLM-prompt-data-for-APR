The buggy function `equals` is mistakenly returning `True` when it should return `False`, causing the failing test case. The issue occurs because the function is not correctly comparing the equality of DataFrames when the blocks are identical but in different locations.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks in DataFrames. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks in DataFrames and return the correct result.

Additionally, for the GitHub issue, the title should be updated to:
```
BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical block values with different locations
```

The detailed description on GitHub should be updated to include the corrected code and the expected output, as well as the relevant version information for pandas and Python.
