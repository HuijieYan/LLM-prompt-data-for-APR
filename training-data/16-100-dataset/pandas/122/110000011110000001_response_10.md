1. The buggy function is a method called `equals` that is supposed to check if two DataFrames are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is using this `equals` method to compare two DataFrames and it should return False, but it's returning True instead.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the values in the DataFrames.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to compare values in two DataFrames using the `equals` method. However, the logic in the function is flawed, resulting in it returning True when it should be False.
   (b). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two DataFrames and asserts that the `equals` method should return False. The error message shows that the comparison is returning True instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Verify that the comparison between the DataFrames is correctly implemented.
   - Check if the sorting and canonicalization of block order is working as intended.
   - Ensure that the logic for comparing the blocks of DataFrames is correct.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._data.get_dict_like_value()
    other_blocks = other._data.get_dict_like_value()
    return self_blocks.equals(other_blocks)
```

With this correction, the `equals` method checks if the DataFrames have the same axes and block structure, and then directly compares their underlying data to determine equality. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected result for the failing test.
