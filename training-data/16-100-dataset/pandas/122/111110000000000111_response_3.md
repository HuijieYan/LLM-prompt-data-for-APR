1. The buggy function is "equals" which is within the class "BlockManager". This class is an internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The github issue is related to the behavior of the equals function when comparing two DataFrames.

2. The potential error location within the "equals" function is the comparison of blocks. It seems that the comparison of blocks may not be considering the locations of the blocks correctly, leading to a false positive when comparing two DataFrames.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The "equals" function is responsible for comparing two DataFrames.
   (b). The "BlockManager" class contains this function and is responsible for managing a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays.
   (c). The GitHub issue mentioned that the "equals" function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This aligns with the observation that the comparison of blocks may be flawed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the comparison of blocks to take into account the locations of the blocks.
   - Ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not erroneously considered as equal.

5. Corrected code for the "equals" function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.list().toarray())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected code takes into account the locations of the blocks by using the "mgr_locs.as_array.list().toarray()" method. This should address the issue of identical blocks with different locations being incorrectly considered as equal.
