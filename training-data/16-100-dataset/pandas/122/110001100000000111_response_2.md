1. The buggy function `equals` in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file compares two DataFrames by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. The function also calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function, which is supposed to consolidate the blocks to ensure accurate comparison. However, there is a mistake in the comparison logic as it does not take into account the order of blocks with identical content but different locations.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" describes a situation where `df3.equals(df4)` returns True when it should return False. This is due to the incorrect block comparison logic in the `equals` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the `sorted` function without considering the block locations.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `equals` function compares the DataFrames based on their axes and blocks, but it does not account for the possibility of identical blocks being located in different positions within the DataFrame.
   (b). The function calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function, indicating an attempt to ensure that the blocks are in a consistent order for comparison.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample with a clear expectation of the output, showing that the function does not behave as expected in certain scenarios. The issue also includes the expected output and the versions of Python and pandas used for testing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic to account for identical blocks in different locations within the DataFrames.
   - Ensure that the blocks are consolidated in a consistent order before comparing them.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks after consolidating them in a consistent order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is used to create a unique representation of each block based on its values and location. The `sorted` function then ensures that the blocks are compared in a consistent order, accounting for their content and location. Additionally, the comparison now uses the `equals` method to compare the values within the blocks, ensuring a more accurate comparison. This approach should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide the expected output.
