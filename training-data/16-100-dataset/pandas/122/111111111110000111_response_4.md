Potential error location within the problematic function:

The issue with the `equals` method is that it is incorrectly returning True for DataFrame objects that have identical blocks but with different locations. This is due to the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method, which does not account for the order of the blocks.

Bug's cause:

(a). The buggy function:
The `equals` method in the BlockManager class compares blocks from two DataFrame objects. It does not take into account the order or location of the blocks, leading to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different block orders.

(b). The buggy class:
The BlockManager class is responsible for managing a set of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays. The `equals` method in this class is the root cause of the bug.

(c). The related functions:
The as_array, _consolidate_inplace, canonicalize, and other functions in the BlockManager class are related to the buggy function, but they do not directly contribute to the bug.

(d). The failing test and error message:
The failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with identical blocks but different block orders and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False. However, the current implementation returns True, leading to the assertion error.

(e). The GitHub Issue information:
The issue title and detailed description confirm that the `equals` method is returning True erroneously for DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `equals` method to account for the block order and locations when comparing blocks between DataFrames.
2. Modify the comparison logic to consider block order and location in the DataFrame comparison process.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to include location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected implementation takes into account the block order and location when comparing blocks between DataFrames. It should successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and also pass the failing test.
