The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test checks the equality of two dataframes using the `equals` method, but it returns True instead of False, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the blocks. The method first consolidates the internal data structures of both objects and then compares the blocks. However, during the comparison, it doesn't handle the case where the blocks have the same elements but are in different locations, leading to incorrect results.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` method, which doesn't account for the possibility of identical blocks in different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
(a) Refactoring the comparison logic to handle blocks with identical elements in different locations.
(b) Ensuring that the comparison takes into account the underlying data and the locations of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function generates a unique representation for each block based on its data and locations. Then, the blocks are sorted using this representation before performing the comparison.

By implementing this correction, the `equals` method now accounts for identical blocks in different locations, resolving the issue observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
