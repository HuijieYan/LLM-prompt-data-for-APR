The `equals` function in the pandas/core/internals/managers.py file is designed to compare two dataframes (`self` and `other`) and determine if they are equal.

The buggy code appears to stem from the logic regarding how the blocks of each dataframe are compared. The bug seems to be located in the section where the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted and then compared. It seems that the bug is causing the comparison between `df1` and `df2` to fail in the test_dataframe_not_equal function, as indicated by the AssertionError message.

To fix the bug:
1. We can remove the redundant `canonicalize` function definition as it is declared twice. Instead, use only one definition of the `canonicalize` function.
2. Update the `canonicalize` function to use `block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()` instead of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should now pass.
