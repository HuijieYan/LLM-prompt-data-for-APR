The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The error message from the failing test indicates that the method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two different DataFrames. This indicates that the logic within the `equals` method is flawed.

The issue likely stems from the comparison being made between the blocks in `self` and `other`. The method attempts to compare these blocks and their locations, but it does so incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be revised so that it correctly compares the blocks and their locations between the two BlockManagers.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the comparison occurs by sorting and canonicalizing the blocks in both `self` and `other`. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple that combines the type name and the array locations of the blocks. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly and addresses the issue of comparing the blocks between the two BlockManagers.
