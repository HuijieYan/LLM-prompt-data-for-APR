The bug in the `equals` function appears to be in the comparison of blocks. The function attempts to sort and compare the blocks based on their dtype and mgr_locs attributes, but there are multiple issues with the implementation that lead to incorrect comparisons.

One issue is the use of `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` when it should be `block.mgr_locs.to_slice()`. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks is not taking into account the dtype of the blocks, which is crucial for determining equality.

To fix the bug, the comparison should take into account both the dtype and the mgr_locs attributes of the blocks.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sort_block(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_block)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison of blocks takes into account both their dtype and mgr_locs attributes, allowing for an accurate determination of equality.
