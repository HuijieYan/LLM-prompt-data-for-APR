The buggy function is the `equals` method for comparing two DataFrames in pandas. The failing test is specifically testing this method with two DataFrames that have the same data but in a different order. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be False.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is likely in the block where the blocks of the dataframes are being sorted and compared.

The bug is caused by the `equals` method not properly handling the comparison of DataFrames when the blocks are in different locations. This leads to the method incorrectly returning True when the order of the blocks in the DataFrames is different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to properly handle the comparison of DataFrames with blocks in different locations. This could involve a more robust sorting mechanism or a different approach to comparing the blocks.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method should now properly handle the comparison of DataFrames with blocks in different locations. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
