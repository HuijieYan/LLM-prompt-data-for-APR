1. The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames and checks if they are equal. It encounters an issue when comparing identical blocks that have different locations. This is due to the use of `canonicalize` function to sort and compare the blocks, which may not accurately represent the equality of the DataFrames.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks for comparison.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` compares two DataFrames and uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks for comparison.
   (b). The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations.
   (c). The GitHub issue highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which indicates that the issue lies in the sorting and comparison mechanism within the `canonicalize` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Considering an alternative approach for sorting and comparing the blocks, such as comparing the blocks directly without using the `canonicalize` function.
   (b). Modifying the `canonicalize` function to accurately represent the equality of the DataFrames, potentially by considering additional attributes for sorting.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the sorting and comparison mechanism has been removed and the comparison now directly checks the equality of blocks between the two DataFrames. Additionally, since the comparison now directly involves the blocks, the issue with identical blocks with different locations should be resolved.
