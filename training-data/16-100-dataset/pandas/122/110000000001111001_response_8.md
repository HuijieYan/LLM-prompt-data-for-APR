The potential error location within the buggy function is the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` because the sorting does not consider the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks.

The bug's cause is that the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` does not consider the dtype and mgr_locs of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison.

To fix the bug, we should include the dtype and mgr_locs in the canonicalization process so that the blocks are sorted based on these criteria as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
