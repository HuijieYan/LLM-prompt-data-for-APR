The buggy function "equals" is a method of the BlockManager class which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function is comparing two BlockManager objects and their internal block data.

The potential error in the function seems to be the comparison of the blocks. It first compares the lengths of self.blocks and other.blocks and then sorts the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs. However, the function does not take into account the possibility of missing blocks or blocks being in different orders in the two managers.

The bug's cause is related to the comparison of blocks without considering the missing or differing order of blocks in the two managers.

To fix the bug, we can consider using a set data structure to compare the sets of blocks in both managers instead of directly comparing the sorted blocks. This would account for the possibility of missing or differently ordered blocks in the two managers.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    if set(type(b) for b in self.blocks) != set(type(b) for b in other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        any(block.equals(oblock) for oblock in other.blocks if type(oblock)==type(block)) 
        for block in self.blocks
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first compare the types of blocks in both managers and return False if they are not the same. Then, we iterate over the blocks in self and check if there is a corresponding block of the same type in other, and if so, compare them. This approach accounts for the possibility of missing or differently ordered blocks in the two managers.
