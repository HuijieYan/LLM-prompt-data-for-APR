The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames for equality. The problem arises from the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function. This function is used to sort the blocks within the DataFrames for comparison, but it does not correctly handle the case where the columns are in a different order.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with the same data but in a different column order, and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` function. The error message shows that the comparison returns True instead of False, indicating that the DataFrames are incorrectly considered equal.

The GitHub issue provides a sample code that reproduces the problem and mentions the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function needs to take into account the column order as well. One approach to fix this would be to concatenate the values of the block as a tuple along with the column name. This will ensure that the comparison accounts for both the column order and the values within the DataFrame blocks.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (tuple(block[column] for column in block.columns), block.index)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now properly accounts for both the column order and the data within the blocks of the DataFrames, ensuring that the comparison in the `equals` function considers all aspects of the DataFrame structure. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass.
