The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is being called with `df1.equals(df2)` in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` from the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`. The error message indicates that the assert statement `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails because the returned result was `True is False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is not functioning correctly and is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The potential error in the `equals` method is likely due to the comparison of the blocks, where the order of the blocks and their contents might not be correctly handled, resulting in an incorrect comparison.

The bug's cause is related to how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort and compare the blocks. It appears that the sorted blocks are not being compared accurately, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be appropriately used to sort and compare the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize blocks using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, list(block.items), block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function is modified to include the list of block items and the block's `mgr_locs`. The `as_array().tolist()` method is used to convert the `mgr_locs` to a list. The comparison logic for the sorted blocks is also updated to include the items for comparison. This revised implementation should now compare the blocks accurately and return the correct result.
