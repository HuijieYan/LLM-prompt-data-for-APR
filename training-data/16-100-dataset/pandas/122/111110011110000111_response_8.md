1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two instances of the class `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and then checks if they are equal using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, but there seems to be an issue with the comparison logic.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `equals` function is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`.
   (b). The failing test creates two DataFrames with different data and expects them to be not equal.
   (c). The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.
   (d). The GitHub issue reports that the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations, which aligns with the failing test scenario.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Reviewing the logic for comparing blocks within the `equals` function.
   (b). Ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled in the comparison process.
   (c). Adding specific checks for block location and equality within the `equals` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.items, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected `equals` function takes into account the item labels and the byte representation of the block locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes.
