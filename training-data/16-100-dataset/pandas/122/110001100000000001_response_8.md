1. The buggy function is called "equals" and it compares two objects and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. It also calls the function "_consolidate_inplace" and "canonicalize", which are from the same file but not the same class.

2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of blocks without first consolidating them in place using the "_consolidate_inplace" function.

3. The bug causes the comparison to be inaccurate because it doesn't handle unconsolidated blocks properly, leading to incorrect results in the comparison.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to ensure that both objects are consolidated in place before comparing their blocks. Additionally, the canonicalize function can be used to properly compare the blocks in a standardized way.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the above corrected code, we ensure that both objects are consolidated in place before comparing their blocks, and we also call the "as_array" function correctly in the canonicalize function.
