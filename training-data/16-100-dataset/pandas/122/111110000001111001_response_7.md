The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly compare the block data from two BlockManager objects. It attempts to sort the blocks based on their data type and location, but it does not properly handle the comparison of block data.

To fix this bug, we should modify the canonicalize function to handle the comparison of block data, and then use it to sort the blocks before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code defines a new canonicalize function that takes a block as input and returns a tuple of the block values and their locations. This tuple is then used to sort the blocks before comparing them in the return statement, ensuring that the comparison is done based on the block data.

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
