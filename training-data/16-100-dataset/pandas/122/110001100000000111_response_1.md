1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames by checking if they have the same axes, blocks, and block order. It calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function from the same file to modify the DataFrames before comparison. The related functions `as_array`, `dtype`, `canonicalize`, and `_consolidate_inplace` are also used in the process of comparing the DataFrames. The GitHub issue indicates that the `equals` function is returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block comparison part, where it sorts and compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The buggy function `equals` compares the DataFrames' blocks by sorting them using the `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's dtype name and manager locations into a tuple.
   (b) The `manager_locs` of blocks might be different, even if the blocks themselves are identical. This could lead to the `equals` function incorrectly returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different block locations.
   (c) The GitHub issue provides a code sample where `df3.equals(df4)` incorrectly returns True when it should return False, indicating the existence of the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Instead of sorting and comparing blocks based on `mgr_locs`, directly compare the blocks' content to check for equality.
   (b) Remove the sorting and comparison based on `mgr_locs` and only compare the blocks' content to determine equality.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks' content without sorting and comparing based on `mgr_locs`, the corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
