The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class in the file pandas/core/internals/managers.py. This function is being called in the failing test_dataframe_not_equal() test in the file pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py.

The potential error location within the equals method is the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks using the canonicalize function. There is a discrepancy between the data types of the 'a' column between df1 and df2, which should be handled.

The cause of the bug is that the equals method is not handling the case where the data types of the columns in the two dataframes being compared are different. This causes the method to return True when it should return False, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the canonicalize function to take into account the data type of the blocks, in addition to their locations. This will ensure that the method properly accounts for differences in data types.

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

With this modification, the corrected version of the equals method is as follows:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the equals method should now properly handle cases where the data types of the columns in the two dataframes being compared are different and pass the failing test.
