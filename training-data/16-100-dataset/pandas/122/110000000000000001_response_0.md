1. The buggy function compares two objects using the equals method, but there are some issues with the processing of the objects that could lead to incorrect comparisons.

2. The potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks of the two objects. There are several processing steps and sorting of blocks before the comparison, which could lead to misaligning the blocks for comparison.

3. The buggy function is trying to compare two objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the process of sorting and canonicalizing the blocks before comparison could lead to incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, the sorting and canonicalization of blocks should be done separately for each object before comparing them.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and canonicalize blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
