The issue appears to be related to the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The comparison is not taking into account the locations of the blocks, which results in the function wrongly returning True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

The error location within the function is likely in the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison does not consider the locations of the blocks.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the function itself and the related functions. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations. However, the comparison of the blocks using the `equals` method does not take into account the sorted order.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should be modified to take into account the sorted order based on the type name and locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will compare the blocks based on their sorted order, taking into account the type name and locations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, and the function will now return the expected values for the given inputs.
