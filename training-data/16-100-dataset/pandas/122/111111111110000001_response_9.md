1. The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is located in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. The error message shows that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the given test case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the comparison of dataframe blocks and not properly handling the case where dataframes are not equal.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks of dataframes for equality.
   (b). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two dataframes that are intentionally not equal, but the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
   (c). The failing test error message shows that the assertion is failing because `assert True is False`.
   (d). The failing test and error message indicate that the `equals` method is not correctly identifying the dataframes as not equal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - The `equals` method should be modified to correctly compare the blocks of dataframes and return `False` when the dataframes are not equal.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected code should ensure that the `equals` method accurately compares the blocks of dataframes and returns the correct result for the failing test.
