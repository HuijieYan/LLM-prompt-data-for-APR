1. The buggy function is within the `BlockManager` class and is called `equals`. This function is used to compare two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. The function checks if the axes, blocks, and their attributes are equal between the two BlockManagers.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. There might be an issue with the comparison logic that leads to incorrect results.

3. Explanation of the bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` compares the axes and blocks of two BlockManager objects to check for equality. It first compares the axes and then compares the blocks using a custom key for sorting. The comparison logic might be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.
   (b). The `BlockManager` class contains methods called by the `equals` function, such as `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and others. These methods are used within the `equals` function to perform various operations and comparisons.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, along with a code sample that demonstrates the unexpected behavior. The code sample creates two DataFrames with columns in different order and tries to compare them using the `equals` method. The expected result is `False`, but the actual result is not as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the comparison logic within the `equals` function to ensure that it properly compares the axes and blocks.
   - Check the implementation of methods called within the `equals` function to ensure they are functioning correctly.
   - Test the `equals` function with different scenarios to identify the specific case where it fails.
   - Update the comparison logic based on the identified issue to ensure correct comparison of blocks and axes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
        
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now correctly converts `mgr_locs` to a list on the `block` object. Additionally, parentheses are added to `as_array` to correctly call the method. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the `equals` function properly compares the blocks and returns the expected result.
