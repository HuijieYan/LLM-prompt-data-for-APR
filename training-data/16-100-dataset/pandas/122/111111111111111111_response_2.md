The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the canonicalize function, as it seems to be mishandling the block order when comparing the blocks of different dataframes.

The bug's cause is that the equals function does not properly compare the blocks of the two dataframes. It incorrectly returns True instead of False in case of identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function so that it correctly orders and compares the blocks of different dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype.name, list(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    equal_blocks = all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    return equal_blocks
```

This corrected code should address the issue and pass the failing test, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided in the test case. Additionally, it resolves the problem described in the GitHub issue.
