The issue with the buggy function is that it is mistakenly using the `zip` function to compare the axes of two BlockManager objects. The `zip` function only iterates up to the length of the shorter iterable, and in this case, it's causing an incorrect comparison of the axes. 

Additionally, the function is trying to use the `block` variable without defining it, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we can rewrite the comparison of axes using a simple for loop, and we need to define the `block` variable before using it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_axes)):
        if not self_axes[i].equals(other_axes[i]):
            return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly compare the axes and return the expected outputs for the provided test cases.
