1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the `BlockManager` class, which is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The function compares two instances of `BlockManager` and checks if they are equal. It does so by comparing the axes and blocks of the two instances.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks. The comparison may fail due to the unconsolidated blocks, which can cause incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause is that the comparison of blocks is not accounting for unconsolidated blocks, which can lead to incorrect results when checking for equality. This is likely causing the function to return incorrect results in some cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the unconsolidated blocks are properly handled during the comparison.
   - Sort the blocks and consolidate them before performing the comparison.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# Fixed equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    self_blocks = self._consolidate()
    other_blocks = other._consolidate()
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

# Additional consolidated function
def _consolidate(self):
    return sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
```
In the corrected code, the `equals` function has been modified to call the `_consolidate` function before comparing the blocks. The `_consolidate` function sorts and consolidates the blocks before the comparison, ensuring that unconsolidated blocks do not impact the equality check.
