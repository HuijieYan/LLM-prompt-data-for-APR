1. The buggy function "equals" is a method of a pandas DataFrame class that is used to check if two dataframes are equal. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is checking the equality of two dataframes that are not equal, but the function returns True incorrectly. The error message shows that the function is returning True instead of False, causing the assertion to fail. The GitHub issue title and detailed description provide information about the problem and the expected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to check for equality of blocks in the dataframes. It seems that the function is incorrectly determining the equality of blocks with different locations, leading to the incorrect return value.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not handling the comparison of dataframe blocks with different locations properly, leading to the incorrect equality result.
   (b). The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is highlighting the problem where two dataframes with different values are mistakenly considered equal by the "equals" function.
   (c). The GitHub issue information confirms the problem and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Improve the logic for comparing dataframe blocks to account for different locations.
   - Ensure that the "equals" function correctly identifies inequality of dataframes, especially when blocks are in different locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code makes improvements to the block comparison logic, using the values and locations of the blocks to accurately determine dataframe equality. This code should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
