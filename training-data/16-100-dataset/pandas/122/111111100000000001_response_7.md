1. The buggy function "equals(self, other)" is part of the BlockManager class and is comparing two instances of the BlockManager class. It relies on the "axes", "_consolidate_inplace", and "blocks" attributes of the BlockManager class, as well as the "canonicalize" function defined within the class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the sorting of the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" lists using the "canonicalize" function. If the "canonicalize" function is not functioning properly, it could lead to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

3. The cause of the bug may be due to incorrect implementation of the "canonicalize" function or issues with the data being sorted and compared within the "equals" function. The "canonicalize" function is used to create a tuple for each block which combines the type name and the "mgr_locs" attribute, and this may not be functioning as intended.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the "canonicalize" function is correctly creating tuples based on the type name and "mgr_locs" attribute. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the sorting and comparison of the blocks within the "equals" function to ensure it is correctly comparing the two instances of the BlockManager class. 

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    
    ... (other class documentation remains the same)
    """
    
    # (other class methods remain the same)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Corrected implementation of the canonicalize function
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```
In this corrected code, the canonicalize function is defined correctly within the BlockManager class, and it uses the block's "dtype.name" and "mgr_locs" attributes to create a tuple for sorting and comparison. Then, the sorting and comparison within the equals function are carried out based on the corrected canonicalize function, which should resolve the issues with the previous buggy function.
