The issue in the `equals` function is that it incorrectly uses the `block.mgr_locs` attribute, assuming it is a list and calling the `as_array` and `tolist` methods on it, which are not defined for the `BlockPlacement` class. Additionally, there is a redundant definition of the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to use the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` to compare its value, and remove the redundant definition of the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code will use the `mgr_locs` attribute directly in the `lambda` function used for sorting the blocks. It eliminates the need for the `canonicalize` function and its dependency on the `as_array` and `tolist` methods, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
