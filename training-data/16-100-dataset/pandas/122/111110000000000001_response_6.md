1. The buggy function `equals` is defined within the class `BlockManager` and is called by other functions within the same class.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)` and `other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)`.
3. The potential cause of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function is not defined properly within the `equals` function, causing an error when trying to sort the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Define the `canonicalize` function properly within the `equals` function.
   b. Also, consider removing the `canonicalize` function if it is not necessary for comparing blocks.

5. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done using a lambda function within the `sorted` method. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` function works as intended.
