1. The buggy function "equals" is a method of the class "BlockManager" and it compares two instances of the BlockManager class. The method performs a comparison of the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine if they are equal. The GitHub issue indicates that the function returns True even when the blocks have identical data but different locations, which is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the blocks using the "equals" method. The sorting of the blocks based on their type name and manager locations may cause the function to incorrectly return True when the blocks have identical data but different locations.

3. The bug is caused by the comparison of the blocks in the "equals" method. The function first consolidates the two instances using the "_consolidate_inplace" method and then sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations. This may lead to incorrect comparisons when the blocks have identical data but different locations, resulting in a False negative comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Implementing a comparison of the blocks that considers the data and locations separately to ensure that identical data with different locations are correctly identified as not equal.
   (b). Modifying the sorting and comparison logic to account for the possibility of identical data with different locations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy "equals" function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block separately
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code, each block is individually compared using the "equals" method to ensure that the comparison considers the data and locations separately. This will prevent the incorrect return of True when the blocks have identical data but different locations.
