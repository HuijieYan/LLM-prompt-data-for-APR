1. The buggy function is a custom implementation of the `equals` method for comparing two DataFrames. The failing test is calling the `equals` method on two DataFrames and expecting it to return `False`, but the actual result is `True`. The GitHub issue provides additional context and a code sample demonstrating the incorrect behavior.

2. The potential error in the code is likely related to how the function compares the blocks within the DataFrames.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` is attempting to compare the DataFrames `self` and `other` using the `equals` method.
   (b). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is calling the `equals` method on two DataFrames and expecting it to return `False`, but the actual result is `True`.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample demonstrating the incorrect behavior and specifies the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for comparing the blocks within the DataFrames.
   - Double check if the sorting and comparison of blocks is being performed correctly.
   - Compare the blocks directly to identify any discrepancies in their content.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.nbytes, block._consolidate_inplace())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code sorts the blocks based on their values and then compares them using the `equals` method, ensuring that the comparison is based on the block content. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
