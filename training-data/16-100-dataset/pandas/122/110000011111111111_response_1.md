The issue is that the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. It should be checking for equality between corresponding blocks, but it's not doing so effectively.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes with the same values but in a different order return `False` when compared with the `equals` function. However, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`, causing the test to fail.

The expected output is `False`, but the actual output is `True`.

The issue described in the GitHub issue is related to this bug, as the `equals` function is not correctly handling identical blocks with different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to effectively compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. We would utilize the `block.equals()` method to compare the individual blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, this fix should also resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue.
