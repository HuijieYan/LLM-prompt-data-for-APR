Potential error location:
The potential error in the function is with the comparison of the blocks. The function is not properly checking the equality of blocks because it is not considering the order of the blocks. Additionally, the canonicalize function is not defined correctly.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function "equals" is not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager. It is not taking into account the order of the blocks when checking for equality, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is checking whether two DataFrames with different block orders are considered equal using the "equals" method. The error message indicates that the method is returning True instead of False, as expected.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the "equals" method is returning incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the canonicalize function to properly define the order of the blocks.
2. Modify the equals function to consider the block order when comparing the blocks for equality.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(blocks):
            return sorted(
                [(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs) for block in blocks], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1].as_array.tolist())
            )
        
        self_blocks_canonicalized = canonicalize(self.blocks)
        other_blocks_canonicalized = canonicalize(other.blocks)
        
        return self_blocks_canonicalized == other_blocks_canonicalized
```

The corrected function includes the following changes:
1. The canonicalize function has been defined to properly define the order of the blocks.
2. The equals function now uses the canonicalize function to compare the canonicalized blocks of self and other for equality.

This corrected code will address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, providing the expected output and resolving the bug.
