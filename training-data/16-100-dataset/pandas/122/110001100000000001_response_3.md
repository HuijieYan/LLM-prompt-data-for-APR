1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two objects by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. It then sorts and compares the blocks using the `canonicalize` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks after sorting. The function `canonicalize` is called twice in the buggy function, which is unnecessary and confusing. 

3. The cause of the bug in the function `equals` is that the blocks are being sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, but the comparison is then performed using the original order of blocks. In addition, there is redundancy in the definition of the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Removing the redundant `canonicalize` function from within the buggy function.
   b. Sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` and appropriately comparing the sorted blocks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the redundancy of the `canonicalize` function has been removed, and the blocks are appropriately sorted using the `canonicalize` function before comparing.
