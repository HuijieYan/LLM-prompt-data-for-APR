The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The failing test is `test_dataframe_not_equal` and it returns an error stating that `df1.equals(df2)` is True when it is expected to be False.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is a comparison of the blocks in self and other. The method uses the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparing, but the method of sorting based on `mgr_locs` may cause issues in certain cases.

The issue is caused by the misordering of the block locations in the `canonicalize` function, leading to the incorrect comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to change the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on both type name and manager locations.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.

This change to the `equals` method ensures that the blocks are sorted based on both type name and manager locations, addressing the misordering issue and resolving the bug.
