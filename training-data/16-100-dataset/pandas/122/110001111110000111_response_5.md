Analysis:
The buggy function is the equals method within the DataFrame class in the pandas library. This method is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. The test_dataframe_not_equal function is trying to assert that two DataFrames with different values are not equal, but it fails.

The error message indicates that the equals method is returning True when it should be False. This means that the logic inside the equals method is not correctly identifying the inequality between the two DataFrames.

The GitHub issue provides additional context, showing that the equals method is returning True when it should return False, leading to unexpected behavior.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison logic within the equals method. It fails to properly handle DataFrames with different values, leading to the method incorrectly returning True for DataFrames that are not equal.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the logic for comparing the DataFrames within the equals method.
2. Ensure that the method correctly identifies differences in the values of the DataFrames.
3. Update the sorting and comparison of blocks to properly check for equality.

Corrected Code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting and comparing blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtypes.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes improved logic for sorting and comparing blocks within the DataFrames. This will ensure that the equals method correctly identifies differences in the values of the DataFrames and returns the expected result.

With this corrected code, the failing test should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
