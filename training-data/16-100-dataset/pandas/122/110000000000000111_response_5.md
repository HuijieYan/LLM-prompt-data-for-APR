1. The buggy function is the `equals` method for DataFrame objects in the pandas library. The function is used to compare two DataFrame objects and returns True if they are equal and False otherwise. The GitHub issue complains that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations, which is not the expected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and locations, and then compares them. However, due to the sorting, the comparison may not accurately reflect the equality of the blocks, especially when they are identical but located differently.

3. The bug's cause is that the function compares the blocks after sorting them, which can lead to inaccurate results when the blocks are identical but located differently.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to first compare the length of the blocks before sorting them. If the lengths are not equal, return False immediately. If the lengths are equal, then compare the blocks without sorting them, as the order and location of the identical blocks should not affect the comparison result.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if not all(block.equals(other.blocks[i]) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)):
        return False

    return True
```

This corrected code compares the length of the blocks first and then directly compares the blocks without sorting them. This approach should give a more accurate comparison result and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
