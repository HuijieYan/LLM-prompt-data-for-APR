Analysis:
The buggy function is the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class in the 'pandas/core/internals/managers.py' file. This method is utilized to check if two BlockManager objects are equal, based on their 'axes' and 'blocks' attributes. Additionally, the 'canonicalize' function is used to sort the blocks before comparison.

The failing test 'test_dataframe_not_equal' is located in the 'pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py' file. This test creates two DataFrames, 'df1' and 'df2', with different data types for the same columns and checks if the 'equals' method returns False.

Error:
The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, resulting in `assert True is False`. This implies that the 'equals' method is not behaving as expected and is returning True when it should be returning False.

Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused due to the malfunctioning of the 'equals' method in handling the comparison of DataFrames with different column datatypes.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class to appropriately handle the comparison between BlockManager objects, specifically when sorting and comparing the blocks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected code, the 'canonicalize' function is modified to use the 'block.values' and 'block.mgr_locs' attributes for sorting the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of blocks is performed using the 'equals' method.
