The `equals` function is supposed to check whether the `BlockManager` instances `self` and `other` are equal. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two instances to determine their equality. However, the comparison is flawed, leading to the failing test.

The error occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The comparison uses the `block.equals(oblock)` method, which fails due to incorrect canonicalization or ordering of the blocks.

The buggy class definition for `BlockManager` and the failing test both highlight the failure of the `equals` method to correctly identify the inequality of the provided `BlockManager` instances. The failing test explicitly checks for inequality, but the `equals` method does not return the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered before comparison so that their equality can be accurately determined. An ordered comparison ensures that the comparison is consistent and not affected by the order of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the types
    # and the block's data to ensure consistency in the ordering
    def canonicalize(blocks):
        return tuple(sorted((b.values if isinstance(b, ObjectBlock) else b), key=lambda x: x.dtype.name))

    self_blocks = canonicalize(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize(other.blocks)
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will accurately determine the equality of the `BlockManager` instances, satisfying the failing test and ensuring consistency with the expected input/output variable information.
