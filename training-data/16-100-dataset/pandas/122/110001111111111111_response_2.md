The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function is comparing the blocks directly, but it should be comparing the data within the blocks. Additionally, the comparison is using the `canonicalize` function incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to iterate over the blocks and compare their data instead of the blocks themselves. We also need to adjust the `canonicalize` function to correctly return the data from the blocks for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block data for comparison
    def canonicalize_data(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub about the incorrect return value of `equals` for identical blocks with different locations.
