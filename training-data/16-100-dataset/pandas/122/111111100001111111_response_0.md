The issue with the buggy function `equals` is that it incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations. This is due to the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function, which is not effectively handling the comparison of blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, the canonicalize function needs to be updated to include the location of the blocks in the sorting criterion. Additionally, the comparison of blocks in the return statement also needs to account for the block locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Include block locations in the comparison
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code includes the block locations in both the sorting of blocks and the comparison of blocks, which addresses the issue reported in the GitHub case. This fix ensures that the `equals` function correctly handles the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, returning the expected results.
