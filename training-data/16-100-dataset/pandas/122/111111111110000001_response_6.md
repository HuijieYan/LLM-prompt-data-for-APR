Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The related functions are `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize`. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames and expects them to be unequal, but the assertion fails, and the error message indicates that it expects the result to be `False` but gets `True`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function is not properly comparing the blocks for equality, leading to incorrect results.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. There should be a proper comparison of the `BlockManager` instances using their blocks.
2. The order of blocks should be taken into account for the comparison.

The corrected code for the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # sort the blocks for comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.mgr_locs.items())))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x.mgr_locs.items())))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality and pass the failing test.
