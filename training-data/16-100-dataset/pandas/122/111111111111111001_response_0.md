The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class. The error message from the failing test asserts that df1.equals(df2) should return False, but it returns True instead.

The equals method of the BlockManager class iterates through the blocks of self and other, checks the axes for equality, consolidates the inplace blocks, and then compares the blocks for equality. There are discrepancies in the expected and actual input/output variable values provided. The expected variables right before the buggy function's return are never set within the function. This explains why the test is failing.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be moved outside of the equals method, and the correct code should sort the blocks with the canonicalize key and compare their equality at the end without changing the self_blocks or other_blocks lists.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )

def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly identify when two BlockManager instances are not equal, and it should pass the failing test case.
