The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function tries to compare two `BlockManager` objects, but it sorts the blocks based on the block type name and manager locations, which is unnecessary and does not reflect the true equality of the two objects.

The error message indicates that the equality comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, which means the comparison logic inside the `equals` function is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` function. We should compare the `axes` and `blocks` of both `BlockManager` objects directly to determine equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def equals(self, other):
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    return True
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function will compare the axes and blocks of both `BlockManager` objects directly, ensuring that the comparison reflects the true equality between the objects. This will address the failing test and the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values.
