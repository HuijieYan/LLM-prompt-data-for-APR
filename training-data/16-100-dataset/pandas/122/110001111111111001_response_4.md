The bug is caused by the use of `self` and `other` variables which are assumed to be `BlockManager` objects, however, based on the failing test and error message, they are actually `DataFrame` objects.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `equals` function to handle `DataFrame` objects correctly. We will also need to update the runtime values and types based on the failing test provided.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if not all(self_axis.equals(other_axis) for self_axis, other_axis in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self._data.blocks) != len(other._data.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    # and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), getattr(block, "mgr_locs", None))

    self_blocks = sorted(self._data.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other._data.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrected code, the function now properly handles `DataFrame` objects and should pass the failing test. The expected values of the variables right before the return should also align with the expected values provided.
