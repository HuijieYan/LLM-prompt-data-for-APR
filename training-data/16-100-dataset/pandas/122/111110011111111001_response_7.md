The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by a mismatch in the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. This leads to the function incorrectly returning `True`, when it should return `False`. The root cause of this bug is likely the incorrect sorting of the `blocks` attribute and the comparison of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix this bug, you should compare the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks directly, without converting it to a list, and also ensure that the blocks are properly sorted for comparison.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function that satisfies the failing test:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
