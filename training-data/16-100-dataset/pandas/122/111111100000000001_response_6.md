The buggy function appears to be comparing two instances of the BlockManager class for equality. It checks the number of axes and if they are not equal, it returns False. Then it iterates through the axes and checks if all axes are equal; if not, it returns False. After that, it consolidates the instances using the '_consolidate_inplace' method, and then it compares the number of blocks in both instances. Next, it attempts to canonicalize the blocks by sorting them based on their data types and locations. Finally, it compares the sorted blocks for equality.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the comparison of axes and blocks. If the axes or blocks are not consolidated before comparison, it could lead to incorrect results.

The bug's cause could be that the blocks are not consolidated before comparison, leading to incorrect equality results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include consolidating the blocks before comparison, ensuring that both instances are in a consistent state before comparison, and possibly improving the canonicalization process for more accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = self._consolidated_blocks()
    other_blocks = other._consolidated_blocks()
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
    
def _consolidated_blocks(self):
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    return sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
```

In the corrected code, the 'equals' function now consolidates the blocks of both instances before comparison by calling the '_consolidated_blocks' method. This method ensures that the blocks are in a consistent state for accurate comparison.
