The buggy function is the equals method, which is used to compare two DataFrames to check if they are equal. The related functions are as_array, _consolidate_inplace, dtype, and canonicalize. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames using the equals method, and it is failing with the error message "assert True is False."

The potential error in the buggy function is the sorting of blocks using the canonicalize function. The sorting is not done correctly, which is causing the equals method to return incorrect results.

The cause of the bug is that the canonicalize function is not handling the comparison of different data types in blocks properly, which leads to incorrect sorting.

To fix the bug, we need to update the canonicalize function to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on both dtype name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected code for the equals method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__array_interface__['typestr'], block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the equals method should now pass the failing test.
