The buggy function is `equals()` which is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. The issue in this function is likely with the sorting of the blocks within the DataFrames. The failing test is trying to assert that two DataFrames with different values are not equal. The error message highlights that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, resulting in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, one approach might be to use the `sort` method on both DataFrames to ensure consistent ordering before comparing the values. Another approach might involve ensuring that the columns are in the same order in both DataFrames before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self = self.sort_index(axis=1)
    other = other.sort_index(axis=1)
    
    # check if the axes are equal
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # consolidate the data frames in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # check if the number of blocks is equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes.name, str(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this correction, we first sort the columns in each dataframe based on their index before comparing them. We also sort the blocks based on their data types and values. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` function produce the expected results.
