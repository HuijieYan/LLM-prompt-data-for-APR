The buggy function "equals" is comparing two objects by iterating through their axes and blocks and calling the "equals" method on each axis and block. The potential error is that it is not properly consolidating the blocks before comparison, which could lead to incorrect results if the blocks are not in the same order.

The related function "_consolidate_inplace" is also called within the buggy function. This function is responsible for consolidating the blocks in place, ensuring that they are in a consistent state before comparison.

The bug is caused by not consolidating the blocks before comparing them. If the blocks are not in the same order or not consolidated, the comparison may produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the "equals" function should call the "_consolidate_inplace" method on both "self" and "other" before comparing the blocks. This ensures that the blocks are in a consistent state before the comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we have added the lines `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` before comparing the blocks, ensuring that the blocks are in a consistent state before the comparison.
