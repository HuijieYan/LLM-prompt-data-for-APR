Potential error location: The issue might be with how the `equals` method is being used to compare two dataframes.

Bug's cause: The error message is indicating that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, suggesting that the `equals` method is not working as expected. The error message also shows the actual and expected values that are being compared, which can help in identifying the cause of the bug.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The `equals` method is comparing the dataframes based on the column names and values, so it should take into account the values of the dataframes as well.
The corrected code for the problematic function, taking into account the values of the dataframes, is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if set(self.columns) != set(other.columns):
        return False
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]).all():
            return False
    return True
```

This approach first checks if the column names of the two dataframes are the same. Then it iterates over each column and checks if the values are equal using `.equals()`, which compares objects for equality. If the values are not equal for any column, the function returns False, otherwise it returns True.

This corrected code addresses the issue of comparing the dataframe values and should pass the failing test.
