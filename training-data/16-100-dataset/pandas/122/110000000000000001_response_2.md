1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two objects, but it contains several potential issues. 
2. The potential error location within the function is the `canonicalize` function, as it is used to sort the blocks but could introduce a bug if not implemented correctly. 
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect implementation of the `canonicalize` function, as it may not accurately sort the blocks.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the `canonicalize` function to ensure it accurately compares and sorts the blocks based on their type and locations, and verifying that the comparison of blocks in the `return` statement is correct.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), list(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
