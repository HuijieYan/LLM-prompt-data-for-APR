1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` which is defined in the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two `BlockManager` objects and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise. The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations and potentially not considering the order of the blocks during comparison.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` without considering the order of the blocks during comparison.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares blocks without considering their order, potentially leading to incorrect results.
   (b). The `BlockManager` class contains functionality to manage labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays, and the `equals` function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects.
   (c). The related function `canonicalize(block)` is used to standardize the comparison order of the blocks.
   (d). The GitHub issue information highlights that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to take into account their order and standardize the comparison order using the `canonicalize` function.
   (b). Ensure that the comparison of blocks considers their location to accurately determine equality.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Standardize the comparison order of blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected `equals` function now considers the order of the blocks during comparison, standardizing the comparison order using the `canonicalize` function. It should now accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` objects, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
