The bug in the equals function appears to be due to the canonicalize function being defined twice, once outside the class and once inside. This is likely causing confusion when the function is called. Another issue is that the canonicalize function does not appear to be a method of the BlockManager class, but it's being used as such.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate canonicalize function and integrate its functionality into the equals function directly. We also need to make sure to access the mgr_locs attribute properly as it appears to be an attribute of the block object.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With these changes, the equals function should now operate correctly and produce the expected output for the given inputs.
