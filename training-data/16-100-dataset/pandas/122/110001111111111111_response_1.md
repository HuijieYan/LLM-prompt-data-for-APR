The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes`. The function is also not using the correct method to check if the axes are equal. Additionally, there is a duplicated inner function `canonicalize` inside the `equals` function which is unnecessary and confusing.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should be modified to correctly compare the axes and remove the duplicated inner function. The comparison of the blocks should also be updated to ensure proper comparison of the DataFrame blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self.blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other.blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected `equals` function, it should pass the failing test (`test_dataframe_not_equal`) and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
