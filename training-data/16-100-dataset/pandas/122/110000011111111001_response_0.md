The buggy function is a method to check if the content of two BlockManager objects `self` and `other` are equal. It does so by comparing their axes and blocks. The bug appears to be in the canonicalization process, where the blocks are sorted using a custom key defined by `canonicalize` function, which is comparing `block` with `oblock`. 

The failing test is related to the DataFrame comparison. It creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` is False.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual value of the input/output variables lies in the incorrect comparison of `IntBlock` data when sorted using the `canonicalize` function. This is causing the `equals` method to return True instead of False.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` method so that it provides a consistent and reliable way to compare the blocks. This can be achieved by comparing the data within `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` directly, without comparing the dtype.name and mgr_locs.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the method will correctly compare the block data without considering the dtype.name and mgr_locs, and it should pass the failing test case.
