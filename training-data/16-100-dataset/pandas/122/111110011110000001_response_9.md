1. The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. It is called by the test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` and is expected to compare two dataframes and return `False` if they are not equal. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison logic that involves sorting and comparing blocks based on their type names and manager locations.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the comparison logic within the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison logic doesn't produce the expected result for the given test case, leading to a failed assertion. The error message clearly states that `assert True is False`, indicating that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - The comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be revised and corrected.
   - The block comparison based on type names and manager locations might not be accurate, so an alternative approach to comparing the dataframes should be considered.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare data block by block using pandas.DataFrame.equals method
    return all(
        self.blocks[i].to_frame().equals(other.blocks[i].to_frame())
        for i in range(len(self.blocks))
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method compares the dataframes block by block using the `equals` method of pandas DataFrame, ensuring accurate comparison and addressing the bug.
