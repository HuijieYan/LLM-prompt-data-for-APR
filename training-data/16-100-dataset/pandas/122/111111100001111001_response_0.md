The potential error in the buggy function is in the sorting of the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" using the "canonicalize" function. The "canonicalize" function is defined inside the buggy function but is also redefined outside the class. Therefore, when the sorting is being performed, it is using the wrong "canonicalize" function.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct "canonicalize" function from the class instead of the one defined within the buggy function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Use the canonicalize function from the class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the correct "canonicalize" function from the class, the function will now properly compare the "self_blocks" and "other_blocks" as expected.
