The buggy function is the "equals" method in the pandas DataFrame class. The function is used to compare two DataFrames and determine if their values are equal. However, the function is incorrectly returning True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

The related functions in the same file include "as_array", "_consolidate_inplace", "dtype", and "canonicalize". These functions are used within the "equals" method for various operations related to comparing the blocks of the DataFrames.

The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" creates two DataFrames with the same data but in different order and checks if the "equals" method returns False. However, the method incorrectly returns True.

The error message indicates that the assert statement is evaluating to "assert True is False", where the expected result is False.

The GitHub issue title and detailed description provided additional context, indicating that the "equals" method is expected to return False in this specific scenario, but it incorrectly returns True.

To fix the bug, the issue lies in the comparison of blocks within the "equals" method. The comparison should consider the locations of the blocks as well, not just the values. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the block comparison logic to also consider the locations of the blocks.

The corrected code for the problematic "equals" method is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and (block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the "equals" method should now pass the failing test and correctly return False when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks in different locations, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
