The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file checks the equality of two DataFrames using the `equals` method, which is expected to return `False`. However, it currently returns `True`, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. This comparison is not correctly handling identical blocks with different locations.

The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method does not properly account for identical blocks with different locations, leading to an incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be modified to properly handle identical blocks with different locations. One possible approach is to sort the blocks based on both type name and manager locations, ensuring that blocks with identical content but different locations are considered equal.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected `equals` method, the failing test should pass, and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved. The method now properly handles identical blocks with different locations, ensuring that the comparison returns the correct result.
