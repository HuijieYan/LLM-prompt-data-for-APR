The bug in the `equals` function is caused by not comparing the actual block data, but instead comparing the block locations. This leads to a situation where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly identified as unequal.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to be modified to compare the actual block data. In the `canonicalize` function, the block data should be returned instead of the block locations. This will ensure that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, regardless of their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values  # Compare the block data instead of the block locations

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the `equals` function correctly compares the actual block data, and will resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
