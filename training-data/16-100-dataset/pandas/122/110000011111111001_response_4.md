The bug in the provided function is located in the canonicalize function. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly determine if two BlockManager objects are equal or not.

The failing test is checking if two dataframes are not equal, but the buggy function is not correctly identifying that they are not equal, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the canonicalize function is correctly comparing the block type and locations. We also need to ensure that the equals method checks for equality based on the canonicalized block order.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly compare the canonicalized block order to determine if two BlockManager objects are equal or not. This should resolve the failing test case and meet the expected input/output variable information.
