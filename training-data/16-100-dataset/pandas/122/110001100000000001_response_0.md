Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the function calls self._consolidate_inplace() and other._consolidate_inplace() before comparing the blocks. This could cause discrepancies in the comparison if the blocks are not in the correct order.

Bug's Cause:
The bug occurs because the _consolidate_inplace() function is called before comparing the blocks, which could lead to mismatched comparisons if the blocks are not in the correct order.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Compare the blocks before calling _consolidate_inplace() to ensure accurate comparisons.
2. Sort the blocks before comparing them to ensure consistency in the comparison process.

Corrected Code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks before consolidation
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we compare the number of blocks before calling _consolidate_inplace() to ensure they have the same number of blocks. Then we sort the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs before comparing them to ensure consistency in the comparison process.
