The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks. The function sorts the blocks by type and location and then compares them, but the comparison is not accurate. This leads to the function returning incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare the actual data within the blocks, rather than just their types and locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [(blk, blk.values) for blk in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [(blk, blk.values) for blk in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

This change ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks, allowing for an accurate comparison between the two BlockManager objects.
