1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two dataframes `self` and `other` by their axes, blocks, and data types. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` attempts to compare two dataframes with different values and expects the result to be `False`. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`.

2. The potential error location within the function is the comparison of the dataframes using `equals()` method, which is not properly handling the comparison of data values.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is comparing the structure and block order but not the actual data values. It is returning `True` instead of `False` when the data values are different.

4. To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to compare the actual data values in addition to the structure and block order. Once the comparison includes the data values, the method will correctly identify when the dataframes are not equal.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including the type name, mgr_locs and data values 
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.index.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the corrections made, the `equals` method should now compare the data values and return the expected result when used in the failing test. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the method correctly identifies when two dataframes are not equal.
