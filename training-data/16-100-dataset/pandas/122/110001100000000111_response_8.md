1. The buggy function `equals` is used to check if two DataFrames are equal. It compares the axes, consolidates the data in place, and then compares the blocks. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns True in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the comparison of blocks after sorting them based on their type name and manager locations. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but with different manager locations.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` is comparing the blocks after sorting them based on their type name and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function.
   (b). The `_consolidate_inplace` function is called on both DataFrames before comparing the blocks, but it doesn't address the issue with different manager locations.
   (c). The GitHub issue information confirms that the function returns True when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different manager locations, which is the incorrect behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the comparison logic to consider the manager locations of the blocks when checking for equality, rather than just sorting and comparing the blocks.
   (b). Modify the `_consolidate_inplace` function to also handle the manager locations to ensure consistency when comparing DataFrames.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_sorted_blocks = sorted(zip(self.blocks, self._get_block_manager_locs()), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[1]))
    other_sorted_blocks = sorted(zip(other.blocks, other._get_block_manager_locs()), key=lambda x: (x[0].dtype.name, x[1]))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_sorted_blocks, other_sorted_blocks))
```

In the corrected code, the comparison logic has been updated to consider the manager locations of the blocks when checking for equality. The `canonicalize` function has been replaced with sorting the blocks and their manager locations together. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
