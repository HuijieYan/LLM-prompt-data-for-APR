The issue lies in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to check whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks. However, the current implementation has a bug where it fails to consider the actual content of the blocks, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

The bug is evident from the GitHub issue, where the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` for two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks but different locations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method without considering their content.

To fix the bug, the `equals` function needs to accurately compare the content of the blocks in addition to their locations. We can achieve this by comparing the actual values within each block, rather than just their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function compares the actual values within each block using the `equals` method. This ensures that the equality check takes into account the content of the blocks rather than just their locations.

With this correction, the `equals` function will behave as expected, and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
