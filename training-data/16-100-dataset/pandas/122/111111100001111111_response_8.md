The bug is caused by the equals function in the BlockManager class. The issue arises from the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, which results in the function incorrectly returning True.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to correctly identify the block locations. By ensuring that the block locations are considered in the comparison, the function will accurately determine equality.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.indexer)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modified version of the equals function includes the indexer of the block's mgr_locs when calculating its canonical representation. This will ensure that blocks with different locations will not be incorrectly identified as equal.

This correction aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided and will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
