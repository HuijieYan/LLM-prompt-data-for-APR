A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations
```

The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of the `managers.py` file returns incorrect results when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations. This has been corrected by updating the canonicalization of block order based on data size and manager locations to ensure consistency in the comparison.

This issue has been fixed in version 0.25.1 of pandas.

To reproduce the bug, consider the following sample:
```python
  df3 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': ['s', 'd']})
  df4 = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['s', 'd'], 'b': [1, 2]})
  assert not df3.equals(df4)
```
reshaping your dataframe or change something, but your answer might be useful anyway.

Version info:
- pandas: 0.25.0
- numpy: 1.16.4
```
