1. The buggy function `equals` is a method that compares two objects of the same type for equality. It compares the axes, blocks, and their content to determine if the objects are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` instantiates two dataframes and checks if they are equal using the `equals` method of the dataframe object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the dataframe blocks for equality.

3. The bug's cause is that the `equals` method is not comparing the dataframes correctly, leading to an assertion error in the failing test. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, indicating that the equality check is failing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method is implemented correctly.
   - Ensuring that the comparison of axes and blocks is consistent and accurate.
   - Addressing any issues in the sorting or canonicalization of blocks before comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block._get_same_shape(other_blocks[i]).equals(oblock) 
        for i, (block, oblock) in enumerate(zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
    )

``` 

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the dataframes for equality and pass the failing test.
