Potential error location:
The issue lies in the canonicalization of block order in the `equals` function. It is incorrectly using the `mgr_locs` attribute as a list, which leads to the incorrect comparison of blocks with different locations.

Bug cause:
The `equals` function is incorrectly comparing the blocks by canonicalizing their order using the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` attribute. This attribute is not suitable for this purpose as it can lead to faulty comparisons of blocks with different locations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different attribute or method to compare the blocks that accounts for their order and location.
2. Rewrite the canonicalize function to accurately represent the distinguishing characteristics of the blocks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code uses the type of block and its `mgr_locs` attribute in the canonicalization process. This accurately represents the characteristics of the blocks that need to be compared, addressing the issue described in the GitHub post.
