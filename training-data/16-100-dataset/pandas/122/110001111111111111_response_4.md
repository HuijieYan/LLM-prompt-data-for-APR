The bug in the `equals` function seems to be caused by the way it handles the sorting and comparison of blocks. The function is not treating the blocks with the same data but different locations as equal, which is leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes into account only their content, and not their location.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to ignore the locations of the blocks, and only consider the data type and the actual data. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))
```

With this change, the `equals` function should compare the blocks based on their data content only, disregarding their location. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected result.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With the above correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected result. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
