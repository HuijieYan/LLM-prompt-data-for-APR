1. The buggy function "equals" is from the class "BlockManager," which is an internal data structure used to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" demonstrates that when using the "equals" function to compare two DataFrames, it incorrectly returns True instead of False, leading to the AssertionError in the test.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between blocks in the self and other BlockManager objects. The sorting of the blocks based on their type name and mgr_locs in the "equals" function might not correctly identify the differences between the two BlockManager objects, leading to the incorrect True result.

3. The bug's cause is that the sorting based on block type and mgr_locs within the "equals" function is not effective in identifying the differences between the blocks in the two BlockManager objects, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

4. Potential approaches for fixing the bug include updating the logic for sorting and comparing the blocks to ensure that the comparisons are accurate and able to identify the differences between the blocks in the two BlockManager objects.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function "equals":
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Creating a list of tuples for self and other blocks
    self_block_info = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in self.blocks]
    other_block_info = [(block.values, block.mgr_locs) for block in other.blocks]

    # Comparing the lists of block tuples
    return all(block_info in other_block_info for block_info in self_block_info) and all(block_info in self_block_info for block_info in other_block_info)
```
With this updated logic, the "equals" function should now correctly compare the blocks in the two BlockManager objects and return the expected result when used to compare DataFrames, passing the failing test.
