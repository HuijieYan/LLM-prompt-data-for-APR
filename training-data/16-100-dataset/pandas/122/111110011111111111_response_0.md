The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the canonicalize block order section, specifically in the tuple creation and sorting. 

The bug's cause is that the equals function is not correctly checking for the equality of the blocks due to an issue in sorting and comparing the blocks of the DataFrame objects. This results in a wrong return value when checking if two DataFrames are equal.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function within the buggy equals function should be modified to correctly return the tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs as an array, and the sorting of self_blocks and other_blocks should also be updated to ensure the correct comparison and equality check of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
