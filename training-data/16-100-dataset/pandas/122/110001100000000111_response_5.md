1. The buggy function "equals" compares two DataFrames by checking if their axes are equal and then iterates through their blocks to check for equality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is after sorting the blocks based on the "canonicalize" function. The bug may be caused by the sorting of blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which might lead to false positives for equal DataFrames with blocks in different locations.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function "equals" first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are of equal length, and if not, returns False. Then it compares the axes for equality using the "equals" method of each axis. After that, it consolidates the DataFrames in place and compares the length of their blocks. Finally, it sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

   (b). The related functions such as "dtype", "_consolidate_inplace", and "canonicalize" also affect the behavior of the buggy function.

   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample and the expected output, indicating that the "equals" function is returning True when it's expected to return False due to identical blocks being in different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the sorting process of the blocks within the "canonicalize" function to account for their different locations. 
   - Use a different approach to compare the blocks for equality that does not rely on their locations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the DataFrames
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks for equality
    self_blocks = self._get_numeric_data().values.tolist()
    other_blocks = other._get_numeric_data().values.tolist()
    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected code removes the sorting of blocks based on their type name and manager locations and instead compares the blocks directly for equality.
