The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two dataframes and check if they are equal. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison made by the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests a problem with the comparison logic in the `equals` function.

The relevant code in the failing test function is:
```python
assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```
The error message indicates that the comparison `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is in the condition:
```python
if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
    return False
```
This condition is comparing the axes of the two dataframes, but the subsequent code does not handle the case where the axes are equal, leading to a potential logical error.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be revised to address the issue where the axes of the two dataframes are equal but the actual data is not.

The corrected code for the `equals` function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self._sort_blocks()
    other_blocks = other._sort_blocks()

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected code:
- The comparison logic has been revised to address the issue where the axes are equal but the actual data is not.
- The function `_sort_blocks` has been introduced internally to handle the sorting of the blocks.

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test without returning a logical error.
