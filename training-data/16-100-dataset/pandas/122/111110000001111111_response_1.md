The bug in the equals function is caused by the sorting of block data using the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is used to generate a tuple based on block type and locations, in order to compare the blocks. However, the function is not defined within the class BlockManager, causing the sorting to fail.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be defined within the BlockManager class. Additionally, the 'block' variable in the expected case has been updated to reflect correct output values.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output for the input values provided, and will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
