Issues:

The buggy function is `equals` from the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is called with the `df1.equals(df2)` statement in the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` from the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.

The problematic part of the function is where it compares the blocks of `self` and `other`. There are issues related to the comparison of the blocks, and the sorting of the blocks based on their type and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function.

The cause of the bug is that the sorting of the blocks based on their type and manager locations is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect comparisons of the blocks.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function before the comparison.
2. Ensure that the comparison of blocks is correct, taking into account all aspects of the blocks that need to be compared.

The Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        block, oblock = self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```
