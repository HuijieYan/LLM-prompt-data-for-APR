1. The buggy function is a method `equals` for comparing two objects. In this case, it is designed to compare two DataFrame objects from the pandas library. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if the `equals` method correctly identifies two different DataFrames as not equal. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

2. The potential error in the function is with the block ordering and comparison. It seems that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the DataFrames, leading to the incorrect result.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the DataFrames which result in the method returning `True` instead of `False`. This leads to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Revisit the block comparison logic and ensure that the function correctly compares the blocks of the DataFrames.
   - Check for any inconsistencies in the block ordering and address them to ensure consistent comparison.
   - Update the logic for comparing DataFrames to handle different block locations properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Add comparison logic for blocks
    self_blocks = sorted((b.values for b in self.blocks), key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x)))
    other_blocks = sorted((b.values for b in other.blocks), key=lambda x: hash(tuple(x)))
    # Convert values back to blocks
    self_blocks = [self._from_blocks([b]) for b in self_blocks]
    other_blocks = [other._from_blocks([b]) for b in other_blocks]

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function includes a modified logic for comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
