The bug in the provided function seems to be the use of the 'block' variable without being properly defined or initialized. Additionally, the use of 'canonicalize' function and the sorting of 'self_blocks' and 'other_blocks' seems unnecessary for the equals method.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to remove the undefined 'block' variable and the unnecessary sorting code. The equals method should only compare the axes and the blocks for equality.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output information and fix the bug in the equals method.
