The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the file `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. This function compares two dataframes to check if they are equal. The potential error location is the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes.

Looking at the failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the file `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py`, it creates two dataframes df1 and df2 with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'. When it asserts `df1.equals(df2) is False`, it expects the comparison to return `False` as the dataframes are not equal. However, the error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`, which caused the assertion to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of blocks within the dataframes is not considering the order of the blocks, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be updated to consider the order of the blocks. This can be achieved by adding sorting for both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the dataframes and pass the failing test.
