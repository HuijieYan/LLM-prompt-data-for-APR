The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The issue is that the comparison does not consider the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two identical DataFrames with columns in different orders. When calling the `equals` method, it incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to the test failure.

To fix this issue, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be updated to consider the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now takes into account the order of the blocks within the `BlockManager` when comparing two instances, thereby resolving the issue with the failing test.

The corrected `equals` function will now correctly return `False` for the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the GitHub issue.
