1. The buggy function compares two objects `self` and `other` using their `axes` and `blocks`. It first checks if the lengths of the `axes` are the same and then proceeds to compare individual elements and blocks. However, there are several issues in the implementation that need to be fixed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of axes and blocks, as well as the sorting logic for the blocks.

3. The cause of the bug is as follows:
   (a) The function `equals` is not properly comparing the elements of `self` and `other`.
   (b) The sorting logic for the blocks may not be correct.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is performed correctly.
   (b) Review the sorting logic and make necessary adjustments.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1 == ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of axes has been changed to use `==` instead of calling the `equals` method of the axes. Additionally, the sorting logic for the blocks has been adjusted to use the `dtypes` attribute.
