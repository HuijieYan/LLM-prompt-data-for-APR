1. The buggy function is a method for comparing two DataFrames to check if they are equal. The GitHub issue also relates to the equals() method incorrectly returning True when two DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the blocks of the DataFrames.

3. The bug's cause is related to the sorting and comparison of the blocks in the DataFrames. The function is incorrectly considering DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations as equal, leading to a False positive in the comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adjusting the comparison logic to take into account the actual location of the blocks in the DataFrames.
   - Ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, [tuple(loc) for loc in block.mgr_locs])

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by considering the tuple of block type name and location in the canonicalize function, ensuring that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly considered equal.
