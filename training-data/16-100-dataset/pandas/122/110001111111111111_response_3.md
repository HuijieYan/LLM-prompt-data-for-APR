The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The sorting is based on the `canonicalize` function, which uses the block's dtype name and mgr_locs to determine the order. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect sorting and comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the `mgr_locs` attribute, and ensure that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.max(), block.mgr_locs.min())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function now takes into account the maximum and minimum values of `mgr_locs`, ensuring that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub by returning the expected value of `False` when comparing the example DataFrames.
