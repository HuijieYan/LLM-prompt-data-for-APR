1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function compares two `BlockManager` objects and their blocks for equality. The function uses the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure that both `BlockManager` objects have consolidated their blocks before comparing them. The issue on GitHub reports that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`. However, there is a discrepancy in the way the `canonicalize` function is defined and used within the `equals` function, which may be causing the incorrect comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
   (b). The `BlockManager` class contains various methods used by the `equals` function, such as `_consolidate_inplace`.
   (c). The `canonicalize` function is defined within the `BlockManager` class but not used correctly within the `equals` function.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides a code sample and the expected output, indicating that the `equals` function is returning incorrect results for identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensure that the `canonicalize` function is used correctly within the `equals` function to sort the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs` for a proper comparison.
   - Check for any other potential discrepancies in the comparison logic within the `equals` function.
   - Test the fix with the provided code sample and ensure that the expected output is achieved.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code ensures that the `canonicalize` function is used correctly within the `equals` function to sort the blocks before comparison. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function returns the expected output for the provided code sample.
