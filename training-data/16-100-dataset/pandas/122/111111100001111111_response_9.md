Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing blocks from two different instances of `BlockManager` based on their types and positions, but the comparison is incorrect leading to unexpected results.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug could be due to the comparison logic within the `equals` function. It appears that the comparison of block types and positions is not accurate, leading to the wrong result.

GitHub Issue Information:
The github issue reflects a case where the `equals` function returns True when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but in different locations. The expected output is False, which indicates that the `equals` function is not working as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to accurately compare the block types and positions between two `BlockManager` instances.

2. Ensure that the comparison considers identical blocks in different positions as unequal, as indicated by the expected output in the github issue.

3. Refactor the `equals` function to address the discrepancy and adhere to the expected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().dtype, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        not block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code would implement a new `canonicalize` function to accurately compare the block types and positions. It would also leverage this function to sort the blocks and compare them in the `equals` function, ensuring that identical blocks in different positions are considered unequal. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
