1. The buggy function is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class and return True if they are equal, False otherwise.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the blocks. The sorting and comparison logic of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` may be causing the issue.

3. The cause of the bug could be that the comparison logic for the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not correctly distinguishing between the blocks, leading to incorrect results. The related functions are `canonicalize` and the `_consolidate_inplace` methods. There could be an issue in the logic of these functions that affects the comparison of the blocks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the logic inside the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it correctly identifies the unique properties of each block. Additionally, reviewing the logic in the `_consolidate_inplace` method to ensure that it properly prepares the blocks for comparison. Finally, reviewing the sorting and comparison logic for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to ensure they are correctly identifying the equivalence of the blocks.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `as_array` method is correctly called with parentheses to convert the array, and the `canonicalize` function correctly converts `mgr_locs` to a list using the `as_array` method and then uses it to create a tuple for comparison. This should help in correctly identifying and comparing the blocks for equality.
