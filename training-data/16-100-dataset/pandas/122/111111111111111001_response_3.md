The bug in the provided function is that the method `canonicalize` is being defined twice, once outside the class BlockManager and once inside it. This is causing unexpected behavior in the function `equals`. The correct `canonicalize` method should be the one defined inside the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, remove the `canonicalize` method that is defined outside the BlockManager class, and modify the `canonicalize` method inside the BlockManager class to accept `self` as the first argument.

Here's the corrected code for the method `equals`:

```python
# This declaration should be kept as is
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    """
    Core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc.
    ...
    """

    # Remove the canonicalize method defined outside the class BlockManager

    # Modify the canonicalize method inside the class BlockManager to accept self as the first argument
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=self.canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=other.canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With the above changes, the `equals` method should now correctly compare the BlockManager objects, and the failing test should pass.
