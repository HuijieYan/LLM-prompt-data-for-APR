The bug seems to be in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The `equals` method is not comparing the content of the data blocks correctly, resulting in the failing test. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two different dataframes and asserts that they are not equal, but the buggy function returns a different result leading to an assertion error.

The issue arises from the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class that has an incorrect implementation for comparing the internal data blocks. The method compares the blocks based on their data types and locations, but this approach is not correct for comparing the content of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to compare the content of the data blocks rather than their types or locations.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):  # Compare the content of the data blocks
            return False

    return True
```

With this corrected implementation, the `equals` method will compare the content of the data blocks between two `BlockManager` instances and return `True` if they have the same content, and `False` otherwise. This will ensure that the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` passes as expected.
