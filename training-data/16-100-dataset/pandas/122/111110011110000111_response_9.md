1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is the equals method within the BlockManager class, which is a core internal data structure used to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. in pandas.
   - The failing test function test_dataframe_not_equal checks if two dataframes are not equal, but the assertion fails when using the equals method.

2. Potential error location:
   - The error is likely occurring in the equals method of the BlockManager class due to incorrect comparison logic for blocks within the method.

3. Bug's cause:
   - The equals method within the BlockManager class is not correctly comparing the blocks of two dataframes, resulting in an incorrect return value.
   - The failing test test_dataframe_not_equal provides an assertion error, indicating that the equals method is returning True when it should be False.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the equals method to ensure proper comparison of block data within the dataframes.
   - Modify the logic within the equals method to accurately determine if two dataframes are equal or not.

5. Corrected code for the equals method:
```python
# corrected equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # compare shape and size of blocks
    if self.shape != other.shape or self.size != other.size:
        return False
    
    # compare block values
    if self.values.tolist() != other.values.tolist():
        return False

    return True
```
By comparing the shape, size, and values of the blocks in the two DataFrames, the corrected equals method ensures that two DataFrames are correctly identified as equal or not. This corrected method should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
