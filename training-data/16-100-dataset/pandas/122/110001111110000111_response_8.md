1. Analysis:
The buggy function "equals" is supposed to compare two DataFrame objects and check if they are equal. The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is checking if two DataFrames with different column orders are considered unequal, but the function is wrongly returning True when it should be False. This discrepancy is leading to the failing test and the corresponding error message, as well as the GitHub issue.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the sorting of blocks using the "canonicalize" function, as it is not taking into account the order of columns in the DataFrames.

3. Bug Cause:
(a). The buggy function "equals" is used to compare DataFrames for equality.
(b). The "canonicalize" function is used to sort the blocks within DataFrames for comparison.
(c). The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" is checking if two DataFrames with different column orders are considered unequal, but the function is returning True instead of False.
(d). The GitHub issue indicates that the function is not behaving as expected when comparing identical blocks with different locations in DataFrames.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the way blocks are sorted in the "canonicalize" function to account for the order of columns in the DataFrames. Additionally, the comparison process in the "equals" function needs to be adjusted to consider the order of columns in the sorted blocks.

5. Corrected Code:
The following corrected code for the "equals" function should resolve the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and the order of columns
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.columns), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code takes into account the order of columns when sorting the blocks using the "canonicalize" function and ensures that the comparison process in the "equals" function considers the order of columns in the sorted blocks. This should resolve the issue and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.
