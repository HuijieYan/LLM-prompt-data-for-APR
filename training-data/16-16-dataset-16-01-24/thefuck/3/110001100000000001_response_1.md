1. The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, it seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the missing imports for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL.

3. The bug's cause is that the necessary imports for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL are missing, which are required for the function to work properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding the necessary imports for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL at the beginning of the file, and ensuring that the function is able to capture the output of the command correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
