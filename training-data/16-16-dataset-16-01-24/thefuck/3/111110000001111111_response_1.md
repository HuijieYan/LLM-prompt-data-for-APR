The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` class to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the function is not returning the expected value, and it seems to be causing a hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the `Popen` class is used to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. It seems that the function is not properly capturing the output of the command and returning it in the expected format.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the output from the `Popen` command. The expected output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is likely causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly capture the output of the `Popen` command and format it as `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. Additionally, the function should be modified to avoid causing a hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected output and avoid causing a hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
