1. The buggy function "info" is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and capturing the output. However, the use of Popen and stdout.read() can lead to potential issues, especially in the context of the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of Popen and stdout.read() to capture the output of the command.

3. The bug's cause is that the function "info" is not handling the command execution properly, leading to potential issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The GitHub issue indicates that the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggers a recursive loop, which is likely caused by the problematic function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a more robust method to capture the output of the command, such as subprocess.check_output.
   - Add error handling to the function to prevent potential recursive loops.
   - Consider the impact of the function on the Oh-My-Fish plugin and ensure that it does not interfere with its functionality.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return "Unable to retrieve Fish shell version"
```

This corrected code uses subprocess.check_output to capture the output of the command and includes error handling to prevent potential issues. It should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
