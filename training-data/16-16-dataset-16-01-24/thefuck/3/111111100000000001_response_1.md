1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class, which is a subclass of the Generic class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it has a bug that prevents it from working correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to the function returning an empty string if the process has not finished executing.

3. The bug is caused by the function not waiting for the process to finish before reading its output. This can result in an empty version string being returned. The related functions, such as Popen and the use of pipes, are also contributing to the bug by not handling the process execution and output reading correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to wait for the process to finish and then read its output. Additionally, we can handle any potential errors that may occur during the process execution.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and then read its output. This ensures that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell. Additionally, we handle any potential errors by redirecting the stderr to `DEVNULL`.
