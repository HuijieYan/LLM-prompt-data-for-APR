1. The buggy function is `info` in the `fish.py` file. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test `test_info` in `test_fish.py` is checking if the function returns the correct version and if the `Popen` call is made with the correct arguments. The error message indicates that the function is returning an unexpected version string. The GitHub issue suggests that the function is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the command used to get the version of the Fish shell.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, leading to an unexpected version string being returned. This is evident from the failing test, which expects a specific version string, and the error message, which shows the actual and expected version strings. The GitHub issue suggests that the function is causing a recursive loop, indicating that the command used may be triggering this behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to get the version of the Fish shell to ensure the correct version string is returned.
   - Check for any recursive behavior triggered by the function and address it to prevent the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

This corrected code uses the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to get the version of the Fish shell. It also extracts the version number from the returned string using `split` to ensure that the function returns the correct version string. This should address the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
