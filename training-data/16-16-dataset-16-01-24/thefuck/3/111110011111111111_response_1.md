The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly retrieving the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the command used to get the Fish shell version should be updated to 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
