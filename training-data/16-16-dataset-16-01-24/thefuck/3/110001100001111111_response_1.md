The issue with the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is that it is not returning the expected version string. The function is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell, but it is not formatting the version string correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not appending the version number to the string "Fish Shell". Instead, it is just returning the version number without any additional text.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to append the version number to the "Fish Shell" string before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now return the expected version string "Fish Shell, version 3.5.9" as per the provided expected value and type of variables. This fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the `thefuck` plugin hanging during Fish Shell initialization.
