The issue with the buggy function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes. It is missing the import statements for the Generic class and the Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL objects.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and classes at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these import statements added, the function should now work as expected and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information.
