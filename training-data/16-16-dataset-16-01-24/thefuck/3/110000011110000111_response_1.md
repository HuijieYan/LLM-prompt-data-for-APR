1. The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test is checking if the `info` method returns the correct version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the returned value includes extra text, causing the assertion to fail. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line is responsible for reading the output of the command and decoding it to get the version number.

3. The bug is caused by the `info` method not correctly parsing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The failing test expects the version number to be '3.5.9', but the actual output includes extra text ('fish, version').

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command to only output the version number without any additional text.
   - Update the `info` method to correctly parse the output and extract the version number.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` method now uses the `fish --version` command to directly get the version number without any additional text. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
