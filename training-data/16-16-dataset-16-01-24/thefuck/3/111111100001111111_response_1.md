The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly capturing the version of the Fish shell. The Popen command is not correctly capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, leading to an incorrect version being returned.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of Popen to capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. This results in the version variable containing an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the Popen command to correctly capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command and then format the version string to include the correct shell name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly capture the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
