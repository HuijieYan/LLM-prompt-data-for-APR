1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function without importing the necessary modules.

3. The bug's cause is that the necessary modules (Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL) are not imported within the class. This causes the function to fail when trying to execute the Popen command.

4. To fix the bug, the necessary modules (Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL) need to be imported within the class. Additionally, error handling should be added to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the Popen command.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```
