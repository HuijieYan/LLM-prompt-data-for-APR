The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The function is currently using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the correct command should be 'fish --version'.

The failing test is expecting the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual output is '3.5.9'. This is because the function is not using the correct command to get the version.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the use of the wrong command to get the Fish shell version.
