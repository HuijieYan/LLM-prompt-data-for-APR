1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish shell plugin in the Oh-My-Fish framework. The GitHub issue indicates that the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()` function. This function is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `Popen` function without importing the necessary modules.

3. The bug's cause is that the `Popen` function is used without importing the required modules, leading to the function not being able to execute properly. This causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the necessary modules for the `Popen` function to work properly.
   - Handling any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By importing the `subprocess` module and using it to call the `Popen` function, the issue with the original buggy function should be resolved. This corrected code should successfully return the name and version of the current shell without causing a recursive loop when used with the `thefuck -v` command.
