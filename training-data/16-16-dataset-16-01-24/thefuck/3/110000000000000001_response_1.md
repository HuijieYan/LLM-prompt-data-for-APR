1. The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output.

2. The potential error location is the use of `Popen` without importing the `subprocess` module.

3. The bug is caused by not importing the `subprocess` module, which is necessary for using the `Popen` function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the `subprocess` module and use the `check_output` function to capture the output of the command.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
