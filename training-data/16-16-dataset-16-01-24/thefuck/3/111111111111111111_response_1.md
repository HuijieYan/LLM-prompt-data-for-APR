The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct way to get the version. Instead, the command 'fish --version' should be used.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
