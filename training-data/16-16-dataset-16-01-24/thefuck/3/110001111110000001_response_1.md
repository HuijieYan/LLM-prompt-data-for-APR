The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is being used, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command '--version'.

The bug's cause is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the 'info' function does not match the command expected by the test.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the 'info' function should be changed to '--version' to match the command expected by the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this correction, the 'info' function will use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and it will pass the failing test.
