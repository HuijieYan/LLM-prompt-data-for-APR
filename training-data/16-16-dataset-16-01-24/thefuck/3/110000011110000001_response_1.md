1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not correctly retrieving the version information from the shell. The failing test is checking if the function returns the correct version information and is also checking the call arguments for Popen.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the version information from the shell.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version information from the shell. The failing test is expecting the version number to be '3.5.9', but the function is returning 'fish, version 3.5.9' which is not the expected format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command used with Popen to retrieve the version information in the correct format.
   - Update the function to format the version information in the expected format.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly retrieve the version information in the expected format and pass the failing test.
