1. The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The failing test is in the `test_fish.py` file. The error message indicates that the expected output of the `info` function is not matching the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function is incorrect, leading to an incorrect version being returned. This causes the failing test to fail and triggers a recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function to ensure the correct version is returned.
   - Modify the `test_info` function to mock the correct output for the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell. This will make the failing test pass and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
