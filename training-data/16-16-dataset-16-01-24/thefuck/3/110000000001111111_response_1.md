The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and capturing the output. However, the function is not handling the process execution and output reading correctly, which is causing the tests to fail.

The expected version of the Fish shell is 'fish, version 3.5.9', but the actual version being captured is '3.5.9'. This indicates that the function is not capturing the complete version string as expected.

The GitHub issue suggests that the function is causing a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, which indicates that the function is not providing the correct version information.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the process execution and output reading to capture the complete version string. Additionally, it should return the version in the expected format 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now capture the complete version string and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
