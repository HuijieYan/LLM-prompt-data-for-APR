The issue with the buggy function is that it is not capturing the correct version of the Fish shell. The Popen call is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using 'fish --version'.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function is returning the version as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' instead of 'fish, version 3.5.9' as expected by the test.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to use 'fish --version' to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. This also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
