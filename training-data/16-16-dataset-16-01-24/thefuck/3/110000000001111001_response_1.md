The issue with the buggy function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes. It is missing the import statement for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL from the subprocess module. 

To fix the bug, we need to import these modules and classes at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output for the given input parameters.
