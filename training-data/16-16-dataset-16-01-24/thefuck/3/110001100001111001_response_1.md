The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. The Popen function is not being used correctly to capture the output.

To fix this, we need to use the communicate() method of the Popen object to capture the output of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command and return the expected value and type of variables.
