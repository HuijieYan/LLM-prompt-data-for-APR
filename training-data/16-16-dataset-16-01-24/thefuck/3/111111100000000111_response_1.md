1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class in the fish.py file of the thefuck project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it uses the Popen function to execute a command and retrieve the version, which can lead to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command, which can cause a recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is that the info() function is using Popen to execute a command that can trigger a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The GitHub issue provides information that the thefuck -v command triggers this recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop.
   - Add a check to prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the function is called with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'OH_MY_FISH_PLUGIN' in os.environ:
            return "Fish Shell"
        else:
            version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the function is being called with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. If it is, the function simply returns "Fish Shell" without triggering the recursive loop. If not, it uses the check_output function to retrieve the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
