1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is used to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that the function is causing a recursive loop when the "TheFuck" plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and then reading the output from the process.

3. The cause of the bug is that the "info" function is triggering a recursive loop when the "TheFuck" plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish. This is likely due to the way the function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Changing the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved to avoid triggering a recursive loop.
   - Adding a check to prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the "TheFuck" plugin is used.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the check_output function to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without triggering a recursive loop. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
