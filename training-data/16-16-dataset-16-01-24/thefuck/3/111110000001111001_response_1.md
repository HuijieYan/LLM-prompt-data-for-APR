The issue with the buggy function is that it is using a MagicMock object instead of actually executing the command to get the version of the Fish shell. This is likely due to the use of MagicMock objects in the test environment, which are not being properly handled in the function.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to actually execute the command to get the version of the Fish shell, instead of using MagicMock objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function will actually execute the command to get the version of the Fish shell and return the expected value and type of variables.
