The potential error in the buggy function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This is causing the version to be retrieved incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the command used to get the Fish shell version should be updated to 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
