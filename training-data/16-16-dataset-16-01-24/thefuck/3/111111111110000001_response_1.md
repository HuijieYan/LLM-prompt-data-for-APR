The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

The bug's cause is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to the incorrect version being returned and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be used. The correct command is 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
