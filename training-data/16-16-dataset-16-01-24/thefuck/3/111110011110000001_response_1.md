1. The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is currently using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The failing test is checking if the returned version matches the expected version and also checking the command that was executed using `Popen`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being executed using `Popen` and the way the version is being extracted from the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is not the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the way the version is being extracted from the output is incorrect, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual version in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
   - Parsing the output of the command to extract the version in the correct format.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
