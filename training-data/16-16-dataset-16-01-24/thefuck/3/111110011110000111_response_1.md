1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function "test_info" is testing this method by mocking the Popen function and asserting the output. The error message indicates that the expected output is not matching the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen, as well as the way the version is being extracted and formatted.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the command being passed to Popen, which is 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION''. The failing test is expecting the output to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but it is getting 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to a recursive loop triggered by the use of the "thefuck -v" command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command passed to Popen to retrieve the version in a different way.
   - Modify the way the version is extracted and formatted to ensure it matches the expected output.
   - Address the recursive loop issue triggered by the "thefuck -v" command.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub. It updates the command passed to Popen to retrieve the version in a different way and modifies the way the version is extracted and formatted to ensure it matches the expected output.
