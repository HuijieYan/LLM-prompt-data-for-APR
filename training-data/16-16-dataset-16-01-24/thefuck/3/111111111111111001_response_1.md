The issue with the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not the correct way to get the version. Instead, the command should be `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
