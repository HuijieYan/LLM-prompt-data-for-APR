1. The buggy function is designed to modify a git command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then replacing the 'push' argument with the value obtained from the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument.

3. The bug's cause is that the code does not correctly handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. It also does not handle the case where the option is not found in the command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the upstream_option_index is not -1 before attempting to remove the option and its argument.
   - Handling the case where the option is not found in the command.
   - Ensuring that the correct index is used when removing the option and its argument.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument by first checking if the option is present in the command, and then removing it if found. We also handle the case where the option is not found in the command.
