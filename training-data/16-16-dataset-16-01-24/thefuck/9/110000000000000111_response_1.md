1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for handling the git push -u command and its suggestions. The function is supposed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command, and then replace the argument 'push' with the push upstream value obtained from the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command, leading to incorrect suggestions for git push -u.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a more robust method to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command.
   - Ensure that the push upstream value is obtained correctly from the command's stderr.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument are correctly removed from the command, and the push upstream value is obtained from the command's stderr. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
