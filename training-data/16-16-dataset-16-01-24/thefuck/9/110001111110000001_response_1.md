The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and replace the `push` argument with the actual branch name obtained from the stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27, which is caused by trying to pop an element from an empty list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `pop` method calls at lines 27 and 28. These calls are trying to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list, but the index `upstream_option_index` might not have been found, resulting in an empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to remove elements from the list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there are more elements after the removed one
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found in the command and should not cause an `IndexError`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
