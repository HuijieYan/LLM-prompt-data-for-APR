1. The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' argument with the value obtained from the stderr. The failing test is checking if the function correctly modifies the command based on the stderr output. The error message indicates an IndexError when trying to pop an element from the command.script_parts list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the pop operation on the command.script_parts list.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the pop operation is being performed twice, which leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which shows that the pop operation is being performed twice in the same if block.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to only perform the pop operation once, and also ensure that the index is within the range of the list before performing the pop operation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test.
