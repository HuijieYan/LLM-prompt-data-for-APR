The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support` that takes a command as input and modifies it based on certain conditions. The failing test function `test_get_new_command` is testing the `get_new_command` function with different inputs and asserting the expected output. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 32 of the `get_new_command` function, specifically when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` at `upstream_option_index`.

The cause of the bug is that the code is trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` at an index that may not exist, leading to the `IndexError`. This is likely due to the fact that the index of `'-u'` is being used to pop an element, but it's not being checked if it exists before trying to pop it.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the index exists before trying to pop it. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct `push_upstream` value is being extracted from the `stderr` and used to replace the argument in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks if the index exists before trying to pop it, and also ensures that the correct `push_upstream` value is being extracted from the `stderr` and used to replace the argument in the command.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
