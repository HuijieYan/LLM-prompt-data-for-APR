The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list. The function is trying to remove the same index twice, which causes an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list only once, and then replace the 'push' command with the `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        command.script_parts[0] = push_upstream
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected code should fix the bug and satisfy all the provided test cases.
