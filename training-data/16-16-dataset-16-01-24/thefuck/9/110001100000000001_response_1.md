1. The buggy function is part of a larger codebase that includes the git_support decorator and the replace_argument function. The function is supposed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' argument with the push_upstream value obtained from the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command.

3. The bug's cause is that the code is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command. This is likely due to the incorrect usage of the pop method and the incorrect index being used to remove the elements from the command.script_parts list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the remove method instead of pop to remove the elements from the list.
   - Using the correct index to remove both the option and its argument.
   - Adding error handling for cases where the --set-upstream or -u option is not found in the command.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we use the try-except block to handle the cases where the --set-upstream or -u option is not found in the command. We also use the correct index to remove both the option and its argument from the command.script_parts list.
