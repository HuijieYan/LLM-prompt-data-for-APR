The buggy function is a part of the `git_push.py` file in the `thefuck` repository. The function is supposed to handle the `git push` command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. However, it seems to have a bug that causes it to not work as intended.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the index of these options in the `command.script_parts` list and removing them.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and removing them. This is causing the incorrect command to be generated.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and remove them. Additionally, it should handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option correctly.
