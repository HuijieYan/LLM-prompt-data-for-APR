The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' command with the actual upstream branch suggested by git. However, the function is not correctly handling the removal of the options and their arguments, and it is also not correctly extracting the suggested upstream branch from the command's stderr.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function is not correctly identifying the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option, and it is not correctly extracting the suggested upstream branch from the command's stderr.

The GitHub issue indicates that the function is not providing the correct suggestion for the git push command when using the '-u' option.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then extract the suggested upstream branch from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, and extract the suggested upstream branch from the command's stderr. It should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
