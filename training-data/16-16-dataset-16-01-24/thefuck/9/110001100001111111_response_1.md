The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the value obtained from the `stderr` of the `command`. However, the function is not correctly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, and it is not correctly extracting the value of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, and it is not correctly extracting the value of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, and then extract the value of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` using a more reliable method.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now correctly identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, and extract the value of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` using a more reliable method. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
