The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but it is not handling the case where the option is not present correctly. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the non-existent index.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list without causing an `IndexError`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
