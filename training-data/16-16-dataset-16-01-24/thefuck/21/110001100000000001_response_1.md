1. The buggy function is a part of a larger codebase related to git commands. It seems to be checking if the command is related to "git stash" and if there is an error message related to usage.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition assumes that the second word in the command script is 'stash', which may not always be the case.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not checking the entire command script for the presence of 'stash', and it's also not checking if the command was successful or not.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the entire command script for the presence of 'stash'
   - Check if the command was successful or not

5. Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr and command.returncode != 0:
        return True
    return False
```
In the corrected code, we are checking if 'stash' is present in the command script, if 'usage:' is present in the error message, and if the command was not successful (returncode != 0). If all these conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
