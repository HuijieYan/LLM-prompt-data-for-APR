The bug in the provided function is due to the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and when split, it results in a list with only one element. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
