The buggy function is using the `split` method on `command.script` and checking if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, this approach is not reliable as it assumes that the second element will always be present and will always be 'stash'. 

To fix this, we can split the `command.script` and then check if 'stash' is in the resulting list. Additionally, we should also check if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
