The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `command` as input and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which means that the `command.script` does not have a second word, causing the `split()` method to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]` because it assumes that there is a second word in the `command.script`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are at least two words in the `command.script` before trying to access the second word. We also need to ensure that the `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if there are at least two words in the `command.script` and then compares the second word to 'stash'. It also checks if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
