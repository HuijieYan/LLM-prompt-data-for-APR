The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split command.script without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments.

To fix this, we need to check if the split command.script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if the split command.script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
