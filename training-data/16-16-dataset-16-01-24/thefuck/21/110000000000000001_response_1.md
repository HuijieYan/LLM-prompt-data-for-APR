1. The buggy function is a decorator function that takes in a command and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the function is the use of the decorator '@git_support' which is not defined in the provided code.

3. The bug's cause is that the decorator '@git_support' is not defined, so the function cannot be executed properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the '@git_support' decorator so that the function can be executed properly.
   - Remove the decorator and directly call the function with a command as an argument.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# Define the git_support decorator
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        # Add the logic of the match function here
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return wrapper

# Call the match function directly with a command as an argument
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

# Example usage
# command = some_command
# result = match(command)
```
