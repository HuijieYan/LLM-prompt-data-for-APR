The buggy function is trying to split the command.script by spaces and then check if the second element is 'stash'. However, it is not taking into account the possibility that the command.script might not have a second element.

The error message indicates that an IndexError is being raised, which means that the split operation is trying to access an index that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation will result in at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split operation results in at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and the function should now pass the failing test.
