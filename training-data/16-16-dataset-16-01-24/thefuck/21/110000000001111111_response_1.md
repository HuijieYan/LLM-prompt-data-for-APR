The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support` that takes a `command` object as an argument and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

The issue arises when the `command.script` is just 'git', as in this case, `command.script.split()` will return `['git']` and `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is no element at index 1.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code checks if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, thus preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring. This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
