1. The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `match` function as an argument. The `match` function checks if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The failing test is checking if the `match` function returns False for a specific command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to access the second element of the split command script, which may not exist if the command script is empty or does not contain any spaces.

3. The bug is caused by the `IndexError` in the `match` function. The failing test is trying to match a command with an empty script, which causes the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the command script is not empty before trying to access its elements.
   - Adding a condition to handle cases where the command script does not contain any spaces.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script and len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
