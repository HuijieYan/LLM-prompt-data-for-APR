The buggy function `match` is part of the `git_fix_stash` rule in the `thefuck` project. The function is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the function is failing with an `IndexError` because it assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace.

The failing test `test_not_match` is checking if the `match` function returns `False` when provided with a `Command` object that represents a `git` command with the `git_stash_err` as stderr.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `IndexError` is occurring in the `git_fix_stash.py` file at line 8, which corresponds to the line where the `match` function is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`.

The GitHub issue title and description provide additional context about the problem, indicating that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to be modified to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, it should return `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the `match` function will first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, it will return `False`, which should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as expected.
