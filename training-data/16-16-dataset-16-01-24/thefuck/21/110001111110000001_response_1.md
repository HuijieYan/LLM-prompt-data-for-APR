1. The buggy function `match` is using the `split()` method on `command.script` to check if the second word in the script is 'stash', and then it checks if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

2. The potential error location is the line `command.script.split()[1]` because it assumes that there will always be at least two words in `command.script`, which may not be the case.

3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word. The failing test is checking for a case where the script is 'git' and the stderr contains the word 'stash', which should not match according to the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before accessing the second element.
   - Add additional checks to ensure that the script is 'git' and the stderr contains 'stash' in the failing test.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
