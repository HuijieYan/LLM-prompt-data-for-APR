The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not handling all possible types of input for the 'key' parameter correctly. The function is trying to handle different types of input such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc., but the logic for handling these different types of input is not implemented correctly.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different types of input for the 'key' parameter. The function is not properly distinguishing between different types of input and is not handling them appropriately.

To fix the bug, the function needs to have proper logic to handle each type of input for the 'key' parameter. This can be achieved by using conditional statements to check the type of the 'key' parameter and then executing the appropriate logic for each type.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected code, we have added conditional statements to properly handle different types of input for the 'key' parameter. This ensures that the function handles each type of input correctly and avoids the bug in the original code.
