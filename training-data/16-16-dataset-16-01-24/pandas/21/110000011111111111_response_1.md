The issue is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function is not treating list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError when a list indexer is used.

To fix the bug, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and passing the failing test. This should also address the issue posted on GitHub.
