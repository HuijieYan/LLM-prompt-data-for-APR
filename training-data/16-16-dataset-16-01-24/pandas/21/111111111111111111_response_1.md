The issue is related to the behavior of different types of indexers when used with the `Series` class. The failing test is checking the behavior of the `Series` class when using different types of indexers, such as list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series. The test is expecting consistent behavior for all types of indexers, but the actual behavior is inconsistent.

The problem lies in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling the different types of indexers consistently, leading to the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not properly handling the different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the different types of indexers consistently. It should treat all types of indexers in a similar manner to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function will handle different types of indexers consistently and should pass the failing test. This change also aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report, as it ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers when used with the `Series` class.
