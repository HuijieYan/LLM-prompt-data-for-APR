The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The function is designed to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the series. The failing test is related to how the function handles a list indexer, which results in a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the list indexer. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to the KeyError.

The bug's cause is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the list indexer properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access values from the series using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the list indexer correctly. It should be updated to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring that it returns the expected values from the series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the KeyError issue. It also aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
