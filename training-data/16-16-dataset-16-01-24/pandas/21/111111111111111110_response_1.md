The issue in the provided code is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like key properly. We can use the `is_list_like` function to check if the key is list-like, and then handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function will now handle list-like keys properly, ensuring consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

This fix should address the failing test cases and resolve the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
