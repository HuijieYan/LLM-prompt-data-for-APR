1. The buggy function is a method called `_get_with` within the `Series` class. It is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values from the series. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, such as list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when using a list indexer.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the case when the key is not list-like. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

3. The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to the KeyError not being raised when it should. The failing test is specifically testing this behavior, and the error message confirms that the function is not behaving as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
   - Ensure that the function correctly handles the list indexer and raises a KeyError when the index does not match any values in the series.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the list indexer correctly and raise a KeyError when the index does not match any values in the series. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
