The issue is related to the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series) with the `ser[key]` operation. The error message indicates that the behavior is inconsistent, and the GitHub issue also highlights this inconsistency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that handle different types of indexers. It seems that the conditional logic is not handling the list-like indexers correctly, leading to the KeyError.

The bug's cause is that the conditional logic for handling list-like indexers is not consistent with the behavior of other indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list-like indexer.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling list-like indexers should be adjusted to match the behavior of other indexers. This will ensure consistency in the behavior of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, and it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
