The buggy function is a method for indexing a Series object in pandas. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, such as list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when using a list indexer.

The potential error location within the function is the block of code that handles the case when the key is not list-like. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, which is causing the KeyError not to be raised.

The bug's cause is that the function is not treating list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and the KeyError not being raised.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
