The buggy function is a method called `_get_with` within the `Series` class. This method is used to retrieve values from the series based on the provided key. The failing test is testing the behavior of the method when a key that does not exist in the series is provided. The error message indicates that the method is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the key when it is not found in the series. It seems that the method is not properly handling the case when the key is not present in the series, which is why the `KeyError` is not being raised.

The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` method is not handling the case when the key is not found in the series properly, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` method needs to be modified to properly handle the case when the key is not found in the series. This can be achieved by adding a check to verify if the key exists in the series and raising a `KeyError` if it does not.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
    
    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` method will now raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the series, satisfying the requirements of the failing test.
