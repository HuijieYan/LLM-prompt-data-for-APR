The issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. The function is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, which is causing the inconsistency in behavior.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional checks for different types of indexers. The function is not properly handling the case when the key is a list-like object, which is leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to properly handle the case when the key is a list-like object. We also need to ensure that the function returns the expected value and type of variables based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code should handle the list-like key correctly and return the expected value and type of variables based on the input parameters.

This fix should resolve the inconsistency in behavior and address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
