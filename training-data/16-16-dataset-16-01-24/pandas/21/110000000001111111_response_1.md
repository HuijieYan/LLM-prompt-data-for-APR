The issue seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the input is a list. The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" suggests that there is inconsistency in how the function handles different types of indexers.

The problem seems to be in the section of the code where it checks the type of the key and how it handles it. The function is not handling the list type properly, which is causing the inconsistency in behavior.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when compared to other types of indexers. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that the behavior for list indexers is different from other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the code to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
