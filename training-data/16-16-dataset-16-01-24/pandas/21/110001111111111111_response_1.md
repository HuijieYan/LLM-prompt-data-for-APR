The issue is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a list.

The failing test is trying to index a Series with a list-like key, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. However, the function is not raising the KeyError as expected, leading to the test failure.

The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, and suggests that all cases should behave like the list case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the list-like key properly and consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys properly and consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
