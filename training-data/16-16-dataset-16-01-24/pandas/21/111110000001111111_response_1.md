The issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling the case where a list indexer is provided correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The problem seems to be occurring when a list indexer is provided, as the function is not handling it properly. This is causing the KeyError to be raised.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle list indexers correctly. It should treat list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the issue and aligning with the expected input/output variable information. This should also address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
