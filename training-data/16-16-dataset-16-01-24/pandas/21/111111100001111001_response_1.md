The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. It incorrectly assumes that the key is not list-like and tries to convert it to a list, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the list-like key separately and perform the appropriate operations based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles the list-like key separately and uses the `loc` attribute to access the elements based on the key type. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for all the provided test cases.
