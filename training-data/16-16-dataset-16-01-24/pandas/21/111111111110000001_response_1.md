The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The function is designed to handle different types of keys and return the corresponding values from the series. The failing test is checking for behavior when a key does not match any index values, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is not handling the different types of keys correctly, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised as expected.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of different types of keys within the `_get_with` function, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the series.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different types of keys and ensure that the `KeyError` is raised when a key does not match any index values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys and raise a `KeyError` when a key does not match any index values. This should make the function pass the failing test.
