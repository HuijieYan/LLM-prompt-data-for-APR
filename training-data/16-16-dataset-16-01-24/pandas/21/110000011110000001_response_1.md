The buggy function is a method that is used for indexing a Series object. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when passing in different types of indexers. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a KeyError as expected.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional block that checks if the key is not list-like. This block returns the result of `self.loc[key]`, which might not be the correct behavior for all types of indexers.

The bug is caused by the function not handling different types of indexers correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle different types of indexers appropriately and return the expected results for each type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle different types of indexers correctly and pass the failing test.
