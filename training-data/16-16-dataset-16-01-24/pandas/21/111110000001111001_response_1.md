The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. It is trying to infer the type of the key and then perform operations based on that type, but it is not handling the list-like case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the list-like case and perform the necessary operations based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code handles the list-like case separately and uses the `loc` attribute to retrieve the values based on the key.

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
