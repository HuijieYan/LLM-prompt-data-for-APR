The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate result. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the function when a list, ndarray, Index, or Series is used as an indexer.

The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when a list is used as an indexer.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the function when different types of indexers are used, specifically pointing out that using a list as an indexer results in a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function to ensure that it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
