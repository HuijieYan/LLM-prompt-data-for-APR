1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class. It is responsible for handling different types of keys and returning the appropriate values based on the key type. It calls other methods such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` to handle different key types.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different key types and the decision-making process to determine whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the decision-making process for choosing between positional and label-based indexing. This decision-making process involves checking the key type and the index type, and it seems that the logic for making this decision is not working correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for determining whether to use positional or label-based indexing and ensure that it is correctly handling different key types and index types.
   - Check the conditions for different key types and index types to make sure that the correct method is being called based on the input.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected code, the logic for determining whether to use positional or label-based indexing has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct method is called based on the input. Additionally, the conditions for different key types and index types have been checked to make sure that the correct method is being called based on the input.
