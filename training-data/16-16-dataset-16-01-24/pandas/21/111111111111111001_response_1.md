The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)`. The function is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input key and determining its type.

The failing test is trying to access a key that is not present in the index, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. However, the function is not raising the KeyError as expected, which indicates that the function is not handling the input key correctly.

The function seems to be incorrectly determining the type of the input key, leading to incorrect behavior. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values, where the `key_type` is expected to be `'string'` but is actually `'integer'` or `'boolean'`.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly determine the type of the input key and handle each type appropriately. It should also ensure that if the key is not present in the index, a KeyError is raised as expected by the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

This corrected code handles different types of input keys and ensures that a KeyError is raised if the key is not present in the index. It also provides appropriate error messages for unsupported key types. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
