The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys and return the corresponding values from the Series. The failing test is trying to access a key that does not exist in the Series, and it expects a KeyError to be raised.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it handles non-existent keys. It seems that the function is not handling the case where the key does not exist in the Series properly, which is causing the KeyError not to be raised as expected.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case where the key does not exist in the Series, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case where the key does not exist in the Series and raise a KeyError as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected code includes a try-except block to catch the KeyError when the key does not exist in the Series and raise a new KeyError with a custom message indicating the non-existent key. This modification should make the function properly handle the case of non-existent keys and pass the failing test.
