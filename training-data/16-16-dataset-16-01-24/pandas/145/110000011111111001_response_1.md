The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `right` input parameter, which is a Series with a dtype of `timedelta64[ns]`. The function is not handling this data type properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to perform the arithmetic operation.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the `timedelta64[ns]` dtype properly and perform the arithmetic operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    return new_data
```

This corrected function handles the case where the `right` input parameter is a Series with a dtype of `timedelta64[ns]` by using the `apply` method to perform the arithmetic operation column-wise. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
