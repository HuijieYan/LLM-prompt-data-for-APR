1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values. The error message indicates that the issue is related to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `column_op` function, where the actual operation between the DataFrame and the Series is being performed.

3. The bug's cause is that the `column_op` function is not handling the operation between the DataFrame and the Series correctly, leading to unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the `column_op` function handles the operation between the DataFrame and the Series appropriately based on their types.
   - Checking for compatibility between the types of the operands before performing the operation.
   - Implementing specific handling for timedelta64 values to ensure that the operation is supported.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
from pandas.core import ops
from pandas.core import common as lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected code includes proper handling for different types of operands and ensures that the operation between the DataFrame and the Series is performed correctly. This corrected code should pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
