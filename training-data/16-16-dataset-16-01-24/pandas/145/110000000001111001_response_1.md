The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameters and the subsequent operations on the DataFrame and Series objects. The function is not correctly dispatching to the Series implementation based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the different cases for the input parameters and perform the operations accordingly. This includes checking the type of the 'right' parameter and its relationship with the 'left' parameter, as well as the 'axis' parameter.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the function to use if-else conditions to handle the different cases for the 'right' parameter and its relationship with the 'left' parameter. This will ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    return new_data
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the different cases for the input parameters and perform the operations accordingly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
