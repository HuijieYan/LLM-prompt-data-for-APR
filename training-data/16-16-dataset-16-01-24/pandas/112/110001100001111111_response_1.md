The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexes and perform operations accordingly. However, it fails to do so when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the type of the index and tries to perform operations based on the type.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not properly handling the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This results in a TypeError when the round method is called on the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This may involve checking the type of the index and performing operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we handle the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex by converting the CategoricalIndex to its categories before performing operations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
