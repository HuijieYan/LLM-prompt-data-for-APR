1. The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is responsible for returning an indexer array that can be used to index into the original array based on the target array. The method makes use of several other methods and attributes within the same class, such as `is_overlapping`, `left`, `right`, `dtype`, `get_loc`, and `_maybe_convert_i8`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that handles different types of target arrays and the corresponding indexing operations.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the incorrect handling of different types of target arrays and the corresponding indexing operations. The method seems to be trying to handle different types of target arrays, such as `IntervalIndex`, homogeneous scalar index, and heterogeneous scalar index, but the logic for each case might not be implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for handling different types of target arrays and ensuring that the indexing operations are implemented correctly for each case.
   - Checking the implementation of related methods such as `get_loc`, `left`, `right`, and `_maybe_convert_i8` to ensure that they are functioning as expected.
   - Verifying the implementation of the `is_overlapping` attribute to ensure that it is being used correctly in the logic of the `get_indexer` method.

5. Corrected code:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called as `self.is_overlapping()`, and the other methods such as `left`, `right`, and `_engine` are also called with parentheses to ensure that they are being invoked correctly. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of target arrays has been reviewed and corrected to ensure that the indexing operations are implemented correctly for each case.
