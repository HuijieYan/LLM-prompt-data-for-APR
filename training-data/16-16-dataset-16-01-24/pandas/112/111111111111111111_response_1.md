The bug is likely located in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, which suggests that there is an issue with the method signature or the way the method is being called.

The failing test is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This suggests that the issue is specific to the `IntervalIndex` class and its interaction with other classes and methods.

The expected output is that the `round` method should work as normal, but it fails with a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class is correctly implemented to handle the specific case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
1. Added parentheses to `self.is_overlapping` to call the method and check if it returns `True` or `False`.
2. Handled the case where the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` and implemented the logic to return the appropriate indexer.
3. For other cases, we use the `get_indexer` method of the `target_as_index` to get the indexer for the `IntervalIndex`.

With these changes, the `get_indexer` method should now handle the specific case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly and pass the failing test.
