The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when converting to integer types. The failing test is expecting a ValueError to be raised when converting NaT values to integer, but the function is not raising the error as expected.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the block that handles the conversion of NaT values to integer types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types. We can achieve this by adding a check for NaT values and raising a ValueError when attempting to convert them to integer types.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if np.isnat(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly raise a ValueError when attempting to convert NaT values to integer types, satisfying the expectations of the failing test cases.
