The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when casting to integer types. The failing test is trying to cast an array containing NaT values to an integer type, which should raise a ValueError according to the test case.

The bug seems to be in the section of the function that handles datetime and timedelta types. It is not correctly handling the case where the input array contains NaT values and needs to be cast to an integer type.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case where the input array contains NaT values and needs to be cast to an integer type. We can add a check for NaT values and raise a ValueError if the input array contains non-finite values (NA or inf) when casting to an integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) or np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64):
        if not np.isnat(arr).all() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where the input array contains NaT values and needs to be cast to an integer type. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
