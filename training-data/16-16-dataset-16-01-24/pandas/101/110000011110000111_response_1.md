The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is testing the function with a `NaT` value and expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function is not raising the expected error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles the conversion of `NaT` values to integer dtype.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integer dtype, leading to unexpected behavior and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integer dtype. This may involve adding a specific check for `NaT` values and raising a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to integer dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pytest

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integer dtype and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
