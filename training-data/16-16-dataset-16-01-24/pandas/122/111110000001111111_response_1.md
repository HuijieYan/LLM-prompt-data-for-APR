The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` variables. The sorting is based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs` of the block. However, the `mgr_locs` are not being properly handled, leading to incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should properly handle the `mgr_locs` of the block. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks should be based on the sorted order.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code properly handles the sorting of blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`, and compares the blocks in the sorted order. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
