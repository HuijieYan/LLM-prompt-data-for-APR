The buggy function is the `equals` method of a class, which is comparing two instances of the same class. The function is intended to check if the two instances are equal, but it has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results.

The bug is likely located in the block where the function compares the blocks of the two instances. The function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, and then compares them. However, it seems that the comparison is not taking into account the actual values of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `equals` method returns True for two DataFrames that have identical blocks with different locations. This aligns with the potential bug location identified in the function.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the blocks should take into account the actual values of the blocks, not just their type name and manager locations. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic to include a comparison of the block values.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now includes the block values in the tuple that is used for sorting the blocks. This ensures that the comparison takes into account the actual values of the blocks.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now return the correct results for the provided test cases and should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
