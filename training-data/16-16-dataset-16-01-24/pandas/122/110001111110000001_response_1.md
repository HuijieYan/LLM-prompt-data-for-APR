The buggy function is the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This function is used to compare two dataframes for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if two dataframes are not equal, and it is failing with the error message `assert True is False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is likely in the comparison of the dataframes. It seems that the comparison logic is not working as expected, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison logic in the `equals` function. It is not handling the comparison of the dataframes correctly, which is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be revised. The corrected code should handle the comparison of the dataframes properly and return the correct result.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now handle the comparison of the dataframes correctly and pass the failing test.
