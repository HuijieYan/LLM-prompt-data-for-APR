The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the sorting of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables. The sorting is based on the `canonicalize` function, which is not defined within the `BlockManager` class. This causes the sorting to fail, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined within the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the `block` variable should be accessed as an attribute of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define the canonicalize function within the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
