The bug in the equals function is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the canonicalize function. The canonicalize function is not correctly implemented, and it is causing the blocks to be sorted in a way that leads to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the canonicalize function should be modified to properly handle the sorting of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison logic in the equals function should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the equals function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the equals function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
