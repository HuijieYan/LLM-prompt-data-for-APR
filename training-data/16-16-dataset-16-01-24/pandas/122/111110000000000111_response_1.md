1. The buggy function `equals` is a method of the `BlockManager` class. It is called when comparing two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. The GitHub issue reports that the `equals` method wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison does not take into account the possibility of identical blocks with different locations.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method not considering the possibility of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user provides a simple test case that fails.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to account for identical blocks with different locations.
   - Consider using a different approach to compare the blocks, such as comparing the values within the blocks rather than the blocks themselves.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected code includes a loop to compare each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns False. If all blocks are equal, the function returns True. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
