1. The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two DataFrames for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are equal, then consolidates the DataFrames in place, and finally compares the blocks within the DataFrames for equality. The issue reported on GitHub is that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting is causing identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `equals` compares the blocks within the DataFrames after sorting them using the `canonicalize` function.
   (b). The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their type name and manager locations, which can cause identical blocks with different locations to be considered unequal.
   (c). The GitHub issue information confirms that the `equals` function wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the type name for sorting the blocks, ignoring the manager locations.
   (b). Update the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to only compare based on the type name, ignoring the manager locations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using only the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code modifies the `canonicalize` function to only consider the type name for sorting the blocks. It then updates the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function to only compare based on the type name, ignoring the manager locations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
