The bug in the function is likely caused by the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and mgr_locs, but it is not taking into account the order of the blocks. This causes the function to return False even when the blocks are actually equal but in a different order.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the index of the block in the sorting key. This will ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their content and order.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their content and order, and it should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
