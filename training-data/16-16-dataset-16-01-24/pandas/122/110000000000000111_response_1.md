1. The buggy function is a method called "equals" for a DataFrame object in pandas. The function is used to compare two DataFrames and return True if they are equal and False if they are not. The GitHub issue is related to this function returning True even when the DataFrames have identical blocks but different locations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the "equals" method. It seems that the function is not taking into account the different locations of identical blocks when comparing the DataFrames.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user expects the function to return False for two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations, but it returns True instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison of blocks to consider their locations as well.
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles cases where identical blocks are located differently in the DataFrames.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function now uses a tuple of the block's type name and its locations to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are properly distinguished. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
