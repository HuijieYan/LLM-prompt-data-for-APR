The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the `self_axes` and `other_axes` lists. The function is also calling the `_consolidate_inplace` method on `self` and `other` without checking if they are already consolidated.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary calls to `_consolidate_inplace` and ensure that the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly compare the axes and blocks of `self` and `other` and return the expected results for the given test case.
