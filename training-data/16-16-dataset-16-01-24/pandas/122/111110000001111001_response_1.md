The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the `canonicalize` function not being defined as a method of the `BlockManager` class. This causes an error when the `canonicalize` function is called within the `equals` function.

To fix this bug, the `canonicalize` function should be defined as a method of the `BlockManager` class. Additionally, the `block` variable should be accessed using `self` to ensure it is referring to the correct instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define canonicalize as a method of the BlockManager class
    def canonicalize(self, block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(self, block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(other, block))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `canonicalize` function is defined as a method of the `BlockManager` class and is called with the correct instance (`self` or `other`). This should fix the bug and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
