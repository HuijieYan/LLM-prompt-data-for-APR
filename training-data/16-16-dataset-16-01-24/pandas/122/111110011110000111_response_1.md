1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes `df1` and `df2` with different values and then checks if `df1` equals `df2`, which is expected to return False. However, the test fails with an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not taking into account the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects.
   (b). The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two dataframes with different values and expects the `equals` method to return False, but it fails with an assertion error.
   (c). The error message indicates that the comparison is returning True instead of False, which is incorrect.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, including the expected output and the versions of pandas and other relevant libraries.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method to consider the order of the blocks.
   - Ensure that the comparison takes into account the values and the order of the blocks to accurately determine equality.

5. Corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` method should now accurately compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and return the expected result. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
