The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames using the `equals` method, and it is expecting the comparison to return `False`.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of the blocks. The method first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal, then it consolidates the blocks in place for both instances, and finally, it compares the blocks for equality. The comparison of the blocks is done by sorting them based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, and then comparing them one by one.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison of the blocks is not producing the expected result, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the blocks is done correctly. One approach could be to compare the blocks based on their values rather than their type name and `mgr_locs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we are comparing the blocks directly using the `equals` method of the blocks. This should ensure that the comparison is done based on the actual values of the blocks, rather than their type name and `mgr_locs`. This should make the `equals` method work as expected and pass the failing test.
