The issue is occurring in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise. However, the method is incorrectly returning `True` in some cases where the blocks have the same data but are located in different positions.

The issue is caused by the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` method. The method sorts the blocks based on their type and location, and then compares them. However, the comparison does not take into account the actual data within the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be updated to consider the actual data within the blocks, rather than just their type and location.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` method will now correctly compare the actual data within the blocks, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
