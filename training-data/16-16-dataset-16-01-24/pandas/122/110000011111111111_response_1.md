The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This is causing the `equals` method to return True when it should be False, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the `equals` method to return False, but it actually returns True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects correctly. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on their type and location, and then comparing them one by one.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects and pass the failing test. It should also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
