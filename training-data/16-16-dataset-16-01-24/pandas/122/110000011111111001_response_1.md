The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the comparison of the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples. The comparison is not taking into account the order of the blocks within the tuples, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to ensure that the order of the blocks is considered.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now converts `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to a tuple to ensure that the order of the locations is preserved. This will allow the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` to be accurate.

With this correction, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
