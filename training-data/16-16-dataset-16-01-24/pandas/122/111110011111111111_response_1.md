The bug is caused by the `equals` function not properly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The function sorts the blocks and then compares them, but it does not take into account the order of the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's index in the sorting key. This will ensure that the blocks are properly compared based on their type, location, and index.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and index because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, i) for i, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals` function should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class and pass the failing test. This will also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
