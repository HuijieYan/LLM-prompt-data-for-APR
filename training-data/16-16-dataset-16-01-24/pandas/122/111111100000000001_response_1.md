1. The buggy function is a method within the BlockManager class. It compares the equality of two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks. It also calls the _consolidate_inplace method to ensure that the blocks are consolidated before comparison.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks using the equals method. There might be an issue with the comparison logic or the way the blocks are sorted and compared.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to compare two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks.
   (b). The BlockManager class contains methods for comparing axes, consolidating blocks, and canonicalizing blocks.
   (c). The related functions include as_array, _consolidate_inplace, equals, and canonicalize, which are used within the BlockManager class for various operations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic for comparing the blocks using the equals method.
   - Ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly.
   - Verify that the _consolidate_inplace method is being called at the right time and in the right context.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the call to `as_array` has been fixed to `as_array()`, and the `canonicalize` function has been defined correctly within the equals method. Additionally, the sorting and comparison of blocks have been adjusted to ensure correct comparison of the BlockManager objects.
