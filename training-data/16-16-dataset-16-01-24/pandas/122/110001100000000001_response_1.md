1. The buggy function "equals" compares two objects and checks if they are equal. It calls the function "_consolidate_inplace" from the same file, but not the same class. The potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks.

2. The potential error location is in the comparison of the blocks, where the function "canonicalize" is used to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations.

3. The bug's cause is that the "canonicalize" function is defined twice in the same file, which can lead to confusion and incorrect sorting of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks may not be accurate due to the sorting method used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Remove the duplicate definition of the "canonicalize" function.
   - Use a more reliable method for sorting the blocks, such as comparing them directly without sorting.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the duplicate definition of the "canonicalize" function has been removed, and the sorting of the blocks has been kept the same. However, it's important to note that the sorting method used may still need to be reviewed for accuracy.
