1. The buggy function is a method called "equals" which is used to compare two DataFrames in pandas. The failing test is trying to compare two DataFrames with different values and expects the result to be False, but the function is returning True instead. The GitHub issue provides additional context and a code sample that reproduces the problem.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of blocks using the "equals" method. It seems that the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames.

3. The bug's cause is that the "equals" method is not correctly comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which shows that the comparison is returning True instead of False.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for comparing blocks within the "equals" method
   - Ensuring that the comparison takes into account the values within the blocks and their locations
   - Testing the function with different scenarios to ensure it returns the correct result

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the "equals" method correctly compares the blocks of the two DataFrames. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
