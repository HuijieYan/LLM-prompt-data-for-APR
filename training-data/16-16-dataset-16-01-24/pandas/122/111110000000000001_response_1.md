The buggy function is a method within the BlockManager class called "equals". This method is used to compare two instances of the BlockManager class and check if they are equal.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the blocks. The comparison is done by sorting the blocks and then checking if each block is equal to the corresponding block in the other instance. However, the sorting and comparison logic may not be accurate, leading to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is that the comparison logic for the blocks is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect results when checking for equality between two instances of the BlockManager class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement a more robust and accurate comparison logic for the blocks.
2. Ensure that the sorting and comparison of the blocks take into account all relevant attributes and properties of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._typ, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function now uses the "_typ" attribute of the block to create a tuple for sorting, and the comparison logic for the blocks has been updated to use the "equals" method of the blocks. This should provide a more accurate comparison of the blocks and fix the bug in the "equals" method.
