The buggy function is the `equals` function in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The function is used to compare two DataFrames and determine if they are equal. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if the `equals` function correctly identifies that two DataFrames are not equal.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `equals` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the comparison logic in the `equals` function is incorrect.

The GitHub issue title and description further confirm that the `equals` function is returning `True` incorrectly in the case of identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the comparison logic based on sorting the blocks using `canonicalize` is not correctly identifying the equality of the blocks.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` function needs to be revised to correctly identify the equality of the blocks in the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected code directly compares the blocks in the DataFrames without sorting them using `canonicalize`. This approach ensures that the equality of the blocks is correctly identified.

With this corrected code, the `equals` function should now pass the failing test and correctly identify the equality of the DataFrames, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
