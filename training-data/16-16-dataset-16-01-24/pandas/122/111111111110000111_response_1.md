1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` file is checking if two DataFrames are not equal using the `equals` method, but it is incorrectly returning True instead of False. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method. It seems that the comparison is not correctly identifying the differences between the blocks, leading to the incorrect result.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `equals` method. The method is not properly identifying the differences between the blocks, leading to the incorrect result. The related functions such as `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` are called within the `equals` method, but the issue seems to be with the comparison logic itself. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking for inequality between two DataFrames, but the `equals` method is returning True instead of False, causing the assertion to fail. The GitHub issue provides additional context and a code sample demonstrating the problem.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the comparison logic within the `equals` method to ensure that it correctly identifies differences between the blocks.
   - Checking the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it properly orders and compares the blocks.
   - Verifying that the `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` functions are working as expected and not causing any unexpected behavior in the comparison process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by using the block values in the `canonicalize` function for proper ordering and comparison. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
