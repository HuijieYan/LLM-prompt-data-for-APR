1. The buggy function is a method that compares two objects for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two objects are of the same length, and if not, returns False. Then it checks if all the axes are equal using a generator expression and the `all` function. After that, it consolidates the objects in place and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it sorts the blocks and compares them for equality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the blocks. It is possible that the `equals` method of the `block` objects is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

3. The bug's cause is that the `equals` method of the `block` objects may not be implemented correctly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the `equals` method for the `block` objects to ensure it correctly compares the blocks for equality.
   - If the `equals` method for the `block` objects is not implemented, consider implementing it based on the properties of the blocks that need to be compared for equality.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we assume that the `equals` method for the `block` objects has been correctly implemented. If not, it should be implemented based on the properties of the blocks that need to be compared for equality.
