1. The buggy function is part of a class called BusinessHourMixin, which contains several related functions such as next_bday, _next_opening_time, _prev_opening_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, _get_closing_time, is_on_offset, and _is_on_offset. The buggy function applies some business hour logic to a datetime object, but it contains several potential errors.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. There are multiple conditional statements and calculations that could lead to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. The function contains complex calculations and conditional statements that may not accurately handle all edge cases. Additionally, the function relies on other functions within the same class to perform the necessary adjustments, and any issues in those functions could also lead to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Simplifying the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours to make it easier to understand and maintain.
   - Adding more comprehensive error handling to account for edge cases and unexpected input.
   - Reviewing and potentially revising the related functions within the same class to ensure they are functioning correctly and providing the necessary support for the buggy function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours has been simplified and streamlined to improve readability and maintainability. Additionally, error handling has been added to raise an exception if the input is not a datetime object.
