1. The buggy function is part of the BusinessHourMixin class in the pandas library. It is used to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. The function seems to be incorrectly calculating the business hours when holidays are included, leading to unexpected behavior when used in conjunction with the pd.date_range function. The GitHub issue describes how the date_range function produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays. It seems that the function is not correctly accounting for holidays, leading to incorrect results.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function apply in the BusinessHourMixin class is responsible for applying custom business hours to a given datetime. It contains logic to adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays.
   (b). The BusinessHourMixin class contains several related functions such as next_bday, _next_opening_time, _prev_opening_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, _get_closing_time, is_on_offset, and _is_on_offset, which are used within the apply function to calculate the adjusted datetime.
   (c). The GitHub issue information describes how the date_range function produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays, indicating that the issue is likely related to the incorrect handling of holidays within the apply function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic within the apply function to ensure that holidays are correctly accounted for when adjusting the datetime.
   - Check the implementation of related functions within the BusinessHourMixin class to ensure they are correctly handling holidays and business hours.
   - Consider refactoring the logic to use a more robust approach for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays
            # ... (existing logic remains unchanged)

            # corrected logic to handle holidays
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
                for holiday in self.holidays:
                    if holiday.date() == other.date():
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, a check for holidays has been added within the apply function. If the CustomBusinessHour instance has holidays specified, it iterates through the holidays and adjusts the datetime to the next opening time if the holiday falls on the same date as the given datetime. This should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
