The buggy function is `apply` which is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, but it is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

The potential error location within the `apply` function is likely related to the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. It seems that the adjustment logic is not handling the custom business hour frequency correctly, leading to the frequency validation error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be updated to properly handle the custom business hour frequency. This may involve modifying the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust the datetime based on the custom business hour frequency
        adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code simplifies the `apply` function to only handle the adjustment of the datetime based on the custom business hour frequency. This should resolve the frequency validation error and make the failing test pass.
