The buggy function is part of a class called BusinessHourMixin, which seems to be related to handling business hours and time intervals. The function takes another datetime object as input and applies some adjustments to it based on the business hours defined in the class.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours. There are multiple conditional statements and loops that could potentially lead to incorrect adjustments.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect adjustments being made to the datetime object, leading to the wrong output. This could be caused by issues in the conditional statements and loops that handle the adjustments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Reviewing and refactoring the conditional statements and loops to ensure they are correctly adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours.
- Adding more descriptive comments and variable names to improve the readability and understanding of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            # Adjust other based on business hours
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours and adjust other
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust based on business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
