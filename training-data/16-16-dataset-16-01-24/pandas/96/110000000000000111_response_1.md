1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it involves the use of pandas date_range with CustomBusinessHour and holidays. The issue in the GitHub post describes how adding holidays to the date_range function results in more periods than expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic for adjusting the business hours when holidays are involved. This is evident from the GitHub issue where adding holidays causes unexpected behavior in the date_range function.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect adjustment of business hours when holidays are present. The function is not handling holidays properly, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that holidays are properly accounted for in the business hour calculations.
   - Checking the logic for adjusting business hours and ensuring it correctly handles holidays.
   - Verifying that the function accurately calculates the number of periods when holidays are included.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class BusinessDay:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if "holidays" in self.__dict__:
            holidays = self.__dict__["holidays"]
        else:
            holidays = []

        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            business_hour_freq = self.freq
        else:
            business_hour_freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=holidays)

        return pd.date_range(start=other, periods=self.n, freq=business_hour_freq)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by properly handling holidays in the CustomBusinessHour frequency. It uses the pandas date_range function to generate the date range based on the business hour frequency, taking holidays into account. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
