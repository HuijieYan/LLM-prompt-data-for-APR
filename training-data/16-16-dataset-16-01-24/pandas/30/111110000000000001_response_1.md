1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class. It is intended to convert a given data array into a date column, handling different data types and formats. However, there are several issues within the function that are causing it to not work as intended.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the new_data variable and the conversion to date using the to_datetime function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the data conversion and date parsing correctly. It is not properly checking for the date format and is not handling exceptions properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly checking the data type and format before attempting to convert to date.
   - Handling exceptions and errors during the conversion process.
   - Ensuring that the function returns the correct data and a boolean indicating the success of the conversion.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the new_data variable is properly handled, and exceptions during the conversion process are caught and handled. The function now returns the correct data and a boolean indicating the success of the conversion.
