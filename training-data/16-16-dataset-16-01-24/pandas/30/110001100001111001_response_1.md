The issue with the _try_convert_to_date function is that it is not correctly converting the data to a date column. It is also not handling the RangeIndex and Series data types properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the RangeIndex and Series data types and convert the data to a date column.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(new_data, pd.RangeIndex):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, unit='s', origin='unix')

    if isinstance(new_data, pd.Series):
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected code should now handle both RangeIndex and Series data types properly and convert the data to a date column as expected.
