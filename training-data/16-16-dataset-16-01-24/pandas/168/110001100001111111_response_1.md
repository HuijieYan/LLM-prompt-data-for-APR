The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of grouping by columns. The function is not correctly identifying the columns when grouping by "x" and is raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the columns when grouping by "x" and perform the grouping and summing operation as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
        group_axis = obj[key]
        return group_axis, [], obj
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code checks if the axis is 1 and the key is in the columns of the DataFrame. If so, it sets the group_axis to the specified key. Otherwise, it falls back to the original behavior of getting the group_axis based on the axis.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and correctly handle grouping by columns.
