1. The buggy function is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper. The GitHub issue is related to the groupby() function not offering implicit selection by column name(s).

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the presence of the key in the object and then tries to group by columns. This is where the KeyError is being raised, indicating that there is an issue with grouping by columns.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by columns. It is not properly identifying the columns and is raising a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the function to correctly handle grouping by columns.
   - Ensure that the function properly identifies the columns and performs the grouping operation without raising a KeyError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # In the future, a tuple key will always mean an actual key,
    # not an iterable of keys. In the meantime, we attempt to provide
    # a warning. We can assume that the user wanted a list of keys when
    # the key is not in the index. We just have to be careful with
    # unhashable elements of `key`. Any unhashable elements implies that
    # they wanted a list of keys.
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18314
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (
            all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            # column names ('a', 'b') -> ['a', 'b']
            # arrays like (a, b) -> [a, b]
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This corrected code should handle the grouping by columns correctly and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
