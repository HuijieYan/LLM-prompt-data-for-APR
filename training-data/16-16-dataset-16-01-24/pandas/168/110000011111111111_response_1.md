The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is causing it to raise a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. This is not the expected behavior, as the intent is to group by columns, but the function is not handling this correctly.

The issue seems to be related to how the function is handling the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. It is not correctly identifying the columns as the grouping key, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to perform the grouping operation.

The failing test is also related to this issue, as it is trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`, and it is expecting the results to be grouped and summed by columns.

The GitHub issue title "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" also aligns with the problem, indicating that there is an issue with grouping by columns using `axis=1`.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by columns. It should identify the columns as the grouping key and perform the grouping operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is None:
        key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the columns as the grouping key when `axis=1` and perform the grouping operation as expected.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
