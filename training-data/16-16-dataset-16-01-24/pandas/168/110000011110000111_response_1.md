1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for grouping data in a DataFrame. The failing test is trying to group the DataFrame along the columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` parameter. However, the function is raising a KeyError when trying to group by the column name "x".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the compatibility of the passed level with the axis of the object.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names when using the `axis=1` parameter. This is leading to a KeyError when trying to group by the column name "x".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for handling grouping by column names when using `axis=1`.
   - Ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the column names for grouping.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names when using `axis=1`, and it should pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
