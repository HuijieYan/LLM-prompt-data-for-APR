The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a single value or a list. The function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when `key` is a list, and ensure that the logic for creating the `groupings` and `exclusions` lists is applied correctly for both single values and lists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # handle the case when key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (remaining function code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case when `key` is a single value or a list, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied for all the provided cases.
