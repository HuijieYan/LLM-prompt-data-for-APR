The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function tries to figure out the passing in references and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper. The error occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. This results in a KeyError, even though the intent is to group by columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the passed single level and validates it with the axis of the object. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the columns as valid keys for grouping when using `axis=1`.

The failing test code demonstrates the issue by trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter, which results in a KeyError. The error message also confirms that the issue is related to the function's inability to correctly identify the columns as valid keys for grouping.

The GitHub issue further highlights the problem, stating that the intent is to group by columns, but the function raises a KeyError even though the column name is a valid key for grouping.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly identify the columns as valid keys for grouping when using `axis=1`. This may involve updating the logic for checking the passed single level and validating it with the axis of the object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify the columns as valid keys for grouping when using `axis=1`, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
