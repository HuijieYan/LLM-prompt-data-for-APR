1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for grouping data along columns, and the issue is about an unexpected KeyError when trying to group by columns.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely in the section where it checks if the passed key is in the object's columns or index names. This is where the function may be failing to correctly identify the columns for grouping.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying the columns for grouping, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user expects to group by columns using the "by" argument, but encounters a KeyError instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the columns for grouping by checking if the passed key is in the object's columns.
   - Handling the grouping by columns in a way that aligns with the user's expectations and the documentation for the groupby() function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if the passed key is a string and if it exists in the object's columns. If it does, we assign the corresponding column to the key. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the columns for grouping and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
