The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the type of the 'group_axis' and 'level' variables. There are multiple if-else blocks that seem to be redundant and may cause confusion.

The bug's cause is likely due to the redundant if-else blocks and the complexity of the logic used to handle different types of input for 'group_axis' and 'level'.

To fix the bug, the code can be simplified by removing the redundant if-else blocks and consolidating the logic for handling 'group_axis' and 'level' into a more straightforward approach.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the redundant if-else blocks have been removed, and the logic for handling 'group_axis' and 'level' has been simplified. This should help in resolving the potential bug and make the function more straightforward.
