The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly. The purpose of using `weakref.ref` is to avoid creating a reference cycle, but in this case, it is not being used to break the reference cycle.

The potential error location is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line should be modified to correctly break the reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used to break the reference cycle, which can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` should be used to create a weak reference to the `self` object, and then the weak reference should be passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is correctly created and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, breaking the reference cycle and avoiding potential memory leaks. This should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
