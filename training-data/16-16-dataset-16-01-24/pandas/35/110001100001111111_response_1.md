The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function. The weak reference is not being properly passed to the _engine_type, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) line, where the weak reference to self is being created but not properly passed to _engine_type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is properly passed to _engine_type.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _engine function to properly pass the weak reference of self to _engine_type. This can be done by modifying the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to self will be properly passed to _engine_type, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
