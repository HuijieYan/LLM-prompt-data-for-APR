1. The buggy function is a property decorator that is used to cache the result of a function call. In the GitHub issue, the problem is related to weak references being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) line, where a weak reference to self is being created.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is causing the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained for the duration it is needed by the _engine function.
   - Check for any potential issues with weak references being dropped prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the cache_readonly decorator is defined to cache the result of the function call. The weakref module is imported, and a weak reference to self is created within the _engine function. This should help in maintaining the weak reference for the required duration and prevent it from being dropped prematurely.
