1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type based on the input parameters. The failing test is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement, specifically the call to self._engine_type(period, len(self)). It seems that the _engine_type method is not returning the expected value, leading to the AttributeError.

3. The bug's cause is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is evident from the failing test and error message, as well as the information provided in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed, and verifying that the _engine_type method returns the expected value.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
            self._engine = func(self)
        return self._engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved.
