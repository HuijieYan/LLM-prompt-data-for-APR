The issue seems to be related to the weak reference to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely the cause of the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine = weakref.ref(engine)
    return engine
```

By maintaining a weak reference to the engine as well, we ensure that the PeriodIndex is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
