The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without checking if `self._engine_type` is `None`. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `self._engine_type` is not `None` before creating the engine.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if self._engine_type is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

With this change, the function will return `None` if `self._engine_type` is `None`, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
