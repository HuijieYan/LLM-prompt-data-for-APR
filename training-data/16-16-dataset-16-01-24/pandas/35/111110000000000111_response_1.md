1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is used to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` to avoid a reference cycle.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the weak reference creation and usage.

3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the usage of the `_engine` method.
   - Check for any premature dropping of the weak reference.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from weakref import ref

# ... (other imports and class definitions)

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = ref(self)  # Use ref() to create a weak reference
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `ref()` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the usage of the `_engine` method, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
