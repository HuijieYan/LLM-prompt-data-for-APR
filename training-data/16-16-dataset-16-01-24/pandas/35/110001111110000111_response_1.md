The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which causes the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but it fails due to the weak reference issue.

The GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revised to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the proper reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import PeriodEngine

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that it receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
