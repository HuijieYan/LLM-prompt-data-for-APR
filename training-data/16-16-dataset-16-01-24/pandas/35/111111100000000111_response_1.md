1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property of the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and the length of the index. The issue on GitHub is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` resulting in the loss of weakrefs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the creation of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` and its usage in the `_engine_type` instantiation.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` but it is not being used correctly in the `_engine_type` instantiation.
   (b). The `PeriodIndex` class is not handling weak references properly, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.
   (c). The related functions are not properly maintaining the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
   (d). The GitHub issue information highlights that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the usage in the `_engine_type` instantiation.
   (b). Properly handle weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class to prevent them from being dropped prematurely.
   (c). Update related functions to correctly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
   (d). Verify that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), weakref.proxy(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` instantiation, and a proxy reference to the `PeriodIndex` is also passed to ensure that the weak reference is maintained. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
