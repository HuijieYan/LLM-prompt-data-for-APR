The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type based on the input parameters. However, the error message indicates that the function is returning a 'NoneType' object, which causes an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The failing test is related to creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checking if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely and is available for the PeriodEngine to use.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

With this correction, the function should now properly return the engine type based on the input parameters, and the failing test should pass without raising an error. This fix also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
