The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex, which is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely due to the weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to the reference being dropped prematurely.

To fix this issue, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be properly maintained so that it is not dropped before intended. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is correctly passed to the _engine_type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, we are passing a weak reference of self to the _engine_type, ensuring that the reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference.
