The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is being used in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the `view` attribute.

The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` method not returning the expected object, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned instead.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns a `NoneType` object. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the returned object is not `None` before attempting to access its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        # Return a default value or handle the error as appropriate
        return None  # Or handle the error in a different way
```

By adding a check for the `NoneType` object returned by `_engine_type`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
