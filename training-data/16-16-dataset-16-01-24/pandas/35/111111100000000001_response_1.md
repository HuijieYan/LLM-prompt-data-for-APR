The potential error in the buggy function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not being assigned to any variable. This means that the weak reference is being created but not being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the weak reference to a variable and then pass that variable to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By assigning the weak reference to the variable `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is being used and the potential issue of unexpected behavior or memory leaks is mitigated.
