The buggy function is using a weak reference to self, but it is not being used correctly. The weak reference should be created using the `weakref` module and the `ref` function, but the code is currently using `weakref.ref` incorrectly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line should be changed to `period = weakref.ref(self._values)` to create a weak reference to the `self._values` attribute.

The bug's cause is that the weak reference is not being created correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when the `_engine` function is called.

To fix the bug, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be changed to `period = weakref.ref(self._values)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
