The buggy function is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic, but it fails due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.

The GitHub issue also describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be modified to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, so that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will only be passed to the `_engine_type` if it is not `None`, preventing the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
