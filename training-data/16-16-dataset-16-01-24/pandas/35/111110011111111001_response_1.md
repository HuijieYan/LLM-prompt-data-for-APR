The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` function not returning the correct value. The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should return the correct value, which is an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

This change ensures that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` if `_engine_type` is not `None`, otherwise it returns `None`.

With this change, the `_engine` function should now return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
