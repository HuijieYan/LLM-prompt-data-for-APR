The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex in the _engine function. The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected PeriodIndex, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

The GitHub issue also mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to properly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In this corrected code, we are creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex and passing it to the _engine_type. Additionally, we are calling the _engine_type to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.

This corrected code should resolve the weak referencing issue and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information. It should also address the issue posted in the GitHub report.
