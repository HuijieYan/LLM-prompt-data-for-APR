The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly. The correct usage should be to call the `weakref.ref` function with `self` as an argument, and then call the resulting weak reference object to obtain the original object. 

Additionally, the return statement should use the weak reference object to create the `_engine_type` instead of using `self` directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly create a weak reference to `self` and use it to create the `_engine_type` object, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
