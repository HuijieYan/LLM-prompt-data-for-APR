The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to a `NoneType` error when the weak reference is accessed.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic. However, due to the weak reference issue in the `_engine` function, it is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the weak reference.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function needs to be properly maintained so that it does not get dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected code, a check is added to ensure that the weak reference `period` is not `None` before creating the `_engine_type`. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when accessing the weak reference.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue described in the GitHub bug report should be resolved.
