The buggy function is a property `_engine` that is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`. The function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with the input parameters `period` and `len(self)`. However, the error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the `view` method, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized.

The failing test is related to the `PeriodIndex._engine` property, which is likely causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` method.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to properly initialize the `_engine_type` and return an instance of it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `@lru_cache` instead of `@cache_readonly`, the `_engine` function will now properly cache the result of the `_engine_type` initialization and return the cached result when called with the same input parameters. This should fix the AttributeError issue and make the function work as expected.
