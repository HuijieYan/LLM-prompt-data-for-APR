1. The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the levels are monotonic. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the `view` attribute.

2. The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or is returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` not being properly initialized or returning `None`. This is causing the `PeriodEngine` to be `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the initialization of `_engine_type` and ensure that it is properly returning an instance of `PeriodEngine`.
   - Verify that the `PeriodEngine` is being set correctly within the `PeriodIndex` class.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._make_engine(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

In this corrected code, we first attempt to initialize the engine using `_engine_type`, and if it returns `None`, we call a method `_make_engine` to create the engine. This ensures that the engine is properly initialized and avoids the AttributeError.
