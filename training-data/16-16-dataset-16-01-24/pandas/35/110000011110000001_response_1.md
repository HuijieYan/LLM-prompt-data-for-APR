1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return the engine type based on the input parameters. The failing test is related to the `is_monotonic` property of the `MultiIndex` levels, which is being accessed through the `_engine` method. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. It seems that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the expected type of object, leading to the 'NoneType' error.

3. The bug is caused by the `_engine` method not returning the expected engine type, resulting in a 'NoneType' object being accessed when trying to check the monotonicity of the index levels. This is evident from the error message, which points to an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure it returns the correct type of object.
   - Verifying that the input parameters passed to `_engine_type` are valid and result in a non-None object being returned.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache_readonly(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_cache'):
            self._engine_cache = func(self)
        return self._engine_cache
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

In the corrected code, a `cache_readonly` decorator is used to ensure that the `_engine` method caches the result of the `_engine_type` method. Additionally, a check is added to ensure that the `_engine_type` method does not return None, and if it does, a ValueError is raised. This should address the bug and ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine type, passing the failing test.
