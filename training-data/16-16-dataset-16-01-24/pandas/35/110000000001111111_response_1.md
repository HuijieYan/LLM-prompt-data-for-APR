The buggy function is a method that is supposed to return a weakly referenced PeriodIndex. However, the function is not properly creating the weak reference, which leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the weakref.ref(self) line, where the weak reference is being created.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly created, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the weak reference creation needs to be corrected so that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
            self._engine = func(self)
        return self._engine
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected code properly creates the weak reference and ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
