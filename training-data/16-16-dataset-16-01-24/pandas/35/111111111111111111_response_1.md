The issue is related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` due to weak referencing.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly maintained, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be properly maintained so that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected code, the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
