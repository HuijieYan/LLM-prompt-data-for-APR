The issue in the buggy function is that it is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly initializing `period`. This is causing an AttributeError when the result is used later in the code.

To fix this bug, we need to properly initialize `period` using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the function should now properly initialize `period` and return the expected result, resolving the AttributeError issue.
