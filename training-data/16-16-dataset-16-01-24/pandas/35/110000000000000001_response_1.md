1. The buggy function is a decorator function that is supposed to cache the result of the _engine function.

2. The potential error location is the use of the @cache_readonly decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

3. The cause of the bug is that the @cache_readonly decorator is not defined, so the function is not actually being cached as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the @cache_readonly decorator to properly cache the result of the _engine function.
   - Use a different caching mechanism such as functools.lru_cache to achieve the desired caching behavior.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import functools

def cache_readonly(func):
    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have defined the cache_readonly decorator using functools.lru_cache to properly cache the result of the _engine function. This should fix the bug and provide the desired caching behavior.
