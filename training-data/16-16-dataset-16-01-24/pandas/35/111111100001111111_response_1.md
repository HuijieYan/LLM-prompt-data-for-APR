The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex, which is causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This is likely due to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

The problematic function is `_engine`, which is using weak referencing to create a reference to the PeriodIndex. However, it seems that the weak reference is being dropped before it should, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

The GitHub issue also mentions that copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs, which further supports the hypothesis that weak referencing is being dropped prematurely.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to the PeriodIndex needs to be maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

This corrected code ensures that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it is used to create the PeriodEngine, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
