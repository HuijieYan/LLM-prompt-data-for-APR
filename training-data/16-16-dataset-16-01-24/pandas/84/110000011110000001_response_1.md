The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`, which is used in the `unstack` method of a DataFrame. The failing test is testing the `unstack` method with a MultiIndex and is failing with a `ValueError` and `KeyError` related to the `_get_level_number` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_level_number` method, specifically the line `level = self.names.index(level)`. This line is causing a `ValueError` when the level is not found in the list of names, and a `KeyError` when the level is not found and is not an integer.

The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` method not handling the case where the level is a tuple, as in the failing test. The method is assuming that the level is a single name, but in the failing test, it is a tuple of names.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be modified to handle the case where the level is a tuple. It should check if the level is a tuple and then iterate over the names in the tuple to find the corresponding level numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle the case where the level is a tuple, as in the failing test, and pass the test successfully.
