The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `clocs` when it is a tuple. The function is expecting `clocs` to be a list of integers representing the level numbers, but when it is a tuple, it fails to handle it properly.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple by converting the tuple of level names to a list of level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert tuple of level names to list of level numbers
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function will be able to handle the input parameter `clocs` properly, whether it is a list of level numbers or a tuple of level names.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
