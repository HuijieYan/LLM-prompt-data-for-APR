The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method, which is used to get the level number of a given level name in the MultiIndex.

The error message indicates that the level name 'A' is not found in the list of names. This is likely due to the fact that the level names are tuples, and the function is not handling this case correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method should be modified to handle tuple level names. Additionally, the function should be updated to handle the case where the level names are tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle both single level names and tuple level names correctly.

Additionally, the `_get_level_number` method should be updated to handle tuple level names. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_level_number` method:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        levels = [self.names.index(name) for name in level]
        return levels
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(
                f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
            )
        try:
            level = self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return level
```

With these changes, the `_get_level_number` method should now correctly handle tuple level names.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
