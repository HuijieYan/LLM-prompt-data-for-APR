The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is not handling the case where the input `clocs` is a tuple. The function is expecting `clocs` to be a list, so it needs to be converted to a list if it's a tuple.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to a list if it's a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both tuples and lists as input for `clocs`. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing test cases.
