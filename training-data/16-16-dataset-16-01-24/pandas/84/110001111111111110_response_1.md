The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is trying to use the tuple `('A', 'a')` directly as a level, which is causing the `KeyError` and `ValueError` exceptions. To fix this issue, the function should handle the case where the input `clocs` is a tuple and extract the level names from the tuple before using them to get the level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and extract the level numbers based on the level names provided in the tuple. This should resolve the `KeyError` and `ValueError` exceptions encountered in the failing test cases.
