The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The error occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` provide the expected input/output variable information and the error message. The failing test is related to unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names, and the error message indicates that the level 'A' is not found.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" provides a clear description of the problem and the steps to reproduce it.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class needs to be modified to handle tuple names correctly. The method should be able to identify tuple names and retrieve the level number accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle tuple names correctly and pass the failing test. This fix should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
