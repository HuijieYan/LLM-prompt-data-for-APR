The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `clocs` when it is a tuple. The function is expecting `clocs` to be a list of integers representing the level numbers, but when it is a tuple, it fails to handle it properly.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the type of `clocs` and handle it accordingly. If `clocs` is a tuple, it should be converted to a list of level numbers before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    elif not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the input parameter `clocs` whether it is a tuple or a list, and it will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

This corrected code should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread, as it addresses the KeyError that was being raised when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.
