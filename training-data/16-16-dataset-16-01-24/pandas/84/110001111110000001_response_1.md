The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `_get_level_number` function, which is used to get the level number of a given level name in the MultiIndex. The error message suggests that the level name 'A' is not found in the list of names.

The potential cause of the bug is that the level name 'A' is being passed to the `_get_level_number` function, but it is not being handled correctly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle the level name correctly and ensure that it is found in the list of names before trying to get its level number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we check if the input `i` is a tuple, and if so, we pass it directly to `_get_level_number`. If it's not a tuple, we convert it to a list and then pass it to `_get_level_number`. This ensures that the level name is handled correctly, and the function should now pass the failing test.
