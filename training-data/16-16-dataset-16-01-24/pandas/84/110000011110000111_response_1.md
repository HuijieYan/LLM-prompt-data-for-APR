The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The error occurs when trying to get the level number for a tuple name in a MultiIndex.

The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are both failing with a `KeyError` and `ValueError` respectively, indicating that the level name is not being found in the MultiIndex.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that the error occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class needs to be modified to handle tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we check if the first element of `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, we directly use the index names to get the level number. Otherwise, we use the original method to get the level number.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
