The issue in the provided function is that it is not handling the case where the input `clocs` is a tuple of names. The function is expecting `clocs` to be a list of integers representing the level numbers, but it should also handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of names.

To fix this issue, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle both cases: when `clocs` is a list of integers and when it is a tuple of names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle both cases: when `clocs` is a list of integers and when it is a tuple of names.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
