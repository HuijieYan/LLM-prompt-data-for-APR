1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for unstacking multi-indexed data. The GitHub issue is related to unstacking multi-indexed data with tuple names, which is failing with a KeyError. The issue arises when trying to unstack a multi-indexed Series using a tuple of names as the level parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line is trying to get the level number for each level name in the `clocs` list, and it seems to be causing the KeyError when the level name is a tuple.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_get_level_number` is not handling tuple names correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to unstack a multi-indexed Series using a tuple of names as the level parameter.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names correctly.
   - Use a different approach to get the level number for each level name in the `clocs` list.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` has been modified to handle tuple names correctly. If the level name is a tuple, it directly gets the index of the tuple in the `names` attribute of the index. This modification should resolve the KeyError issue when unstacking multi-indexed data with tuple names.
