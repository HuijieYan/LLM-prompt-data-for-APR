The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The error is raised when trying to get the level number for a tuple name in the MultiIndex.

The failing test cases are related to unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names, and the error message indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the list of names.

The GitHub issue title for this bug is "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError", and the detailed description provides an example of the failing scenario.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle the case where the level is a tuple name in the MultiIndex. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for getting the level number and handling tuple names appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_number = index.names.index(cloc)
        else:
            cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle the unstacking of MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and pass the failing test cases. This fix should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
