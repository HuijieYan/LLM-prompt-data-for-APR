The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `clocs` input parameter. The function is trying to get the level number of the index using the `_get_level_number` method, but it's not handling the case where the level is a tuple. This results in a ValueError or KeyError being raised.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and extract the level numbers accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and extract the level numbers accordingly.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
