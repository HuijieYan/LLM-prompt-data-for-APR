The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, which mentions that the issue occurs on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the `date_range` function is used to create `binner` and `labels` based on the `first` and `last` timestamps. This process does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially on clock change days. This may involve using a different approach to create `binner` and `labels` that accounts for ambiguous timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0]
    last = ax[-1]

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last + Timedelta(days=1),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles ambiguous timestamps by using the first and last timestamps directly to create the `binner` and `labels`, and adding a day to the `last` timestamp to ensure that all timestamps are included. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue described in the GitHub issue.
