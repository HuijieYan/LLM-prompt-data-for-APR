1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba". The issue is related to the behavior of pd.Grouper when handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in certain timezones.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps and the generation of time bins.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, specifically in the context of the pd.Grouper function. The function is not handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError as described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Implementing a more robust handling of ambiguous timestamps within the _get_time_bins function, specifically considering the behavior on clock change days in different timezones.
   - Ensuring that the time bins are generated in a way that accounts for ambiguous timestamps and does not lead to errors.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code aims to address the issue described in the GitHub post by ensuring that the handling of ambiguous timestamps is done in a way that prevents the AmbiguousTimeError.
