The issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, specifically in the context of the `pd.Grouper` function. The bug seems to be causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data with a daily frequency on a day where the clock changes, such as in the case of Cuba on November 4th, 2018.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` when handling the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change correctly, ensuring that the grouping operation does not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change correctly, ensuring that the grouping operation does not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
