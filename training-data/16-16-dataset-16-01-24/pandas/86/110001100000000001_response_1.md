1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for reshaping data using the pivot method. It takes in a DataFrame and performs the pivot operation based on the provided index, columns, and values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the 'values' parameter is None. This conditional statement does not handle the case where 'index' is also None.

3. The bug's cause is that when 'values' is None and 'index' is also None, the function does not handle this scenario properly, leading to unexpected behavior. This can cause issues when trying to pivot the data without specifying the index and values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a conditional statement to handle the case where both 'values' and 'index' are None.
   - Ensure that the function can handle different combinations of input parameters gracefully.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is None:
            raise ValueError("At least one of 'index' or 'values' must be specified")
        cols = [index, columns]
        indexed = data.set_index(cols)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, a conditional statement has been added to handle the case where both 'values' and 'index' are None. If both are None, the function raises a ValueError indicating that at least one of 'index' or 'values' must be specified. This ensures that the function handles different combinations of input parameters gracefully and prevents unexpected behavior.
