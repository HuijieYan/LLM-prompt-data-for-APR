The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the loop where the `agg_block` is being created and appended to `agg_blocks`. There are multiple conditional statements and try-except blocks within the loop, which could be causing unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause could be due to the complex logic within the loop that handles different scenarios for aggregation. It's possible that the conditional statements and try-except blocks are not handling all cases correctly, leading to unexpected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic within the loop to handle aggregation in a more straightforward manner.
2. Use separate functions or methods to handle different aggregation scenarios, making the code more modular and easier to understand.
3. Add more detailed error handling to catch any unexpected cases and provide meaningful error messages.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._perform_aggregation(block, how, alt, min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _perform_aggregation(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        return block.make_block(result)
    except NotImplementedError:
        if alt is not None:
            result = self._perform_alternate_aggregation(block, alt)
            return block.make_block(result)
        else:
            return None

def _perform_alternate_aggregation(self, block, alt):
    obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
    if obj.shape[1] == 1:
        obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
    result = cast(DataFrame, result)

    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Unexpected result from alternate aggregation")

    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the logic for aggregation has been separated into different methods to handle different scenarios. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand. Additionally, more detailed error handling has been added to catch unexpected cases and provide meaningful error messages.
