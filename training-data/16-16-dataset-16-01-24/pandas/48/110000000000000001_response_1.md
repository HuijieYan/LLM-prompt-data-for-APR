1. The buggy function is a method that aggregates data in a pandas DataFrame. It loops through the blocks of the data and performs aggregation based on the specified method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the loop that iterates through the blocks of the data and performs aggregation. There are multiple try-except blocks and conditional statements that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the complex logic within the loop that handles different aggregation scenarios, including handling exceptions and alternate aggregation methods. This complexity makes it difficult to track and handle all possible scenarios correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include simplifying the logic within the loop, breaking down the aggregation process into smaller, more manageable steps, and handling exceptions and alternate aggregation methods in a more structured and predictable manner.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[Index] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not provided")
            else:
                result = block.values.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        agg_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reorder the aggregated items
    indexer = np.concatenate(agg_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Update the block locations
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the logic within the loop has been simplified, and the handling of alternate aggregation methods has been structured more predictably. The code also ensures that the aggregated items are correctly reordered and the block locations are updated accordingly.
