The issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class when calling the `mean` function. The bug is likely located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, as it is responsible for aggregating the data.

The expected output of the `mean` function when applied to a `DataFrameGroupBy` object is not being achieved, and the issue is reproducible with other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly and produce the expected output when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `mean` function works as expected with nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
