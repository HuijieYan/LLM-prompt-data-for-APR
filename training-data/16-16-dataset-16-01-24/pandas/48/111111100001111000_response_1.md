The issue with the buggy function is that it is not returning the expected output. The function is supposed to perform aggregation on the data, but the returned `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are not as expected.

To fix the function, we need to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly and that the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are populated with the correct values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Concatenate new_items and update agg_items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we are iterating through each block in the data and performing the aggregation using the `agg` method. The resulting aggregated block is then added to `agg_blocks` and the corresponding items are added to `agg_items`. Finally, the function returns `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` as expected.
