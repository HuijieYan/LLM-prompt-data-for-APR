1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. This function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on grouped data. The GitHub issue indicates that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the aggregation operation is performed on the grouped data. This is where the TypeError is likely being raised.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the handling of the `Int64` dtype during the aggregation process. The `DataFrameGroupBy` class and its related functions, including the `aggregate` function, are involved in the aggregation process. The GitHub issue provides specific examples of how the error occurs when calling `mean` after grouping with `Int64` dtype.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for compatibility with the `Int64` dtype during the aggregation process and handling it appropriately.
   - Reviewing the aggregation logic to ensure that it can handle nullable integer data types correctly.
   - Testing the aggregation process with different data types to identify and address any specific issues related to `Int64` dtype.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code simplifies the aggregation process by directly calling `self.grouper.aggregate` on each block and creating the aggregated blocks. It also ensures that the locs in the blocks are correctly reset to correspond to the current ordering. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
