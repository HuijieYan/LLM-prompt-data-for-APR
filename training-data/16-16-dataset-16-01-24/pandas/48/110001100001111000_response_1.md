The issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is that it is not properly handling the aggregation of data when the `how` parameter is set to `'mean'`, `'median'`, or `'var'`. The function is returning the same result for all these cases, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the different aggregation methods. The code should be modified to properly calculate the mean, median, and variance of the data based on the `how` parameter.

Here's an example of how the function can be updated to address the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    if how == 'mean':
        result = data.mean()
    elif how == 'median':
        result = data.median()
    elif how == 'var':
        result = data.var()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported aggregation method")

    # rest of the code...
```

In this updated code, the `how` parameter is used to determine which aggregation method to apply to the data. Depending on the value of `how`, the `mean()`, `median()`, or `var()` method is called on the `data` to calculate the mean, median, or variance, respectively.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles different aggregation methods and returns the appropriate result based on the specified method.
