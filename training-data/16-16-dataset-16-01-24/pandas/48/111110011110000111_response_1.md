The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64. This is likely due to the use of the `astype` method with the 'safe' casting rule, which is not suitable for this scenario.

The issue is related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should handle the nullable integer data type appropriately and resolve the TypeError issue when performing aggregation operations.

This fix should address the problem described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test passes successfully.
