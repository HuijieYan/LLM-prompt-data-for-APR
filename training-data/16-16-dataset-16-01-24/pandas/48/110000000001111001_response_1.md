The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the aggregation of data and the handling of different data types. The function is designed to aggregate data based on certain criteria, but it seems to be encountering issues when dealing with different data types and conditions.

One potential cause of the bug could be the handling of non-numeric data when the `numeric_only` parameter is set to `True`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to aggregate non-numeric data.

To fix the bug, the function should include additional checks to handle non-numeric data when `numeric_only` is set to `True`. It should also ensure that the aggregation process is consistent and handles different data types appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    else:
        data = data.dropna()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to handle non-numeric data when `numeric_only` is set to `True`. This ensures that the aggregation process is consistent and handles different data types appropriately.
