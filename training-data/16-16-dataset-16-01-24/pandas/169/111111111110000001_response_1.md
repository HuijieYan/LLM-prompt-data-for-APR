The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The failing test is trying to call the `quantile` method on a DataFrame containing date values, and it is failing with a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is the line `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)`. This line is trying to calculate the quantile, and it seems to be failing when the DataFrame contains non-numeric data.

The bug's cause is that the `quantile` method is not handling non-numeric data correctly. It is trying to calculate the quantile even for non-numeric columns, which leads to the `ValueError` when trying to concatenate the results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `quantile` method to handle non-numeric data properly. We can do this by first checking if the DataFrame contains numeric data before calculating the quantile.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    if data.empty:
        return data

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this modification, the `quantile` method will first check if the DataFrame contains numeric data before calculating the quantile. If the DataFrame is empty or contains no numeric data, it will return the DataFrame as is. This should fix the `ValueError` that was occurring in the failing test.
