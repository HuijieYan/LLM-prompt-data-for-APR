The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the creation and mapping of input tensors. The function is not correctly handling the input_tensors parameter and is not properly creating and caching the input layers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it handles the input_tensors. It seems that the function is not correctly creating and caching the input layers, leading to issues in the subsequent steps of the function.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of input_tensors and the incorrect caching of input layers. This results in incorrect mapping and usage of input tensors in the later stages of the function.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the input_tensors parameter and ensure that input layers are correctly created and cached. Additionally, the mapping of input and output tensors should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = 'input_' + str(i)
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name=name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the handling of input_tensors is improved to ensure that input layers are correctly created and cached. Additionally, the mapping of input and output tensors is maintained as in the original function. This should address the issues and fix the bug.
