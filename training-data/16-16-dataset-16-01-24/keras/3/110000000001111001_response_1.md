The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the input layers are being created and mapped to the original input layers. This is evident from the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values, particularly in the `input_layers` variable, which is empty when it should contain the newly created input layers.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect mapping of the original input layers to the newly created input layers, leading to the `input_layers` list not being populated as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the newly created input layers are correctly mapped to the original input layers and added to the `input_layers` list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Add the newly created input layer to input_layers
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
        for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Add the newly created input layer to input_layers
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the newly created input layers are added to the `input_layers` list when they are created, ensuring that the mapping between original and new input layers is maintained. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.
