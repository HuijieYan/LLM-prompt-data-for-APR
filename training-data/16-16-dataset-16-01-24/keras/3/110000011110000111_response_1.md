The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is used to clone a functional `Model` instance. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, but it fails with the error message "Could not compute output Tensor".

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles multiple outputs and their corresponding tensors and masks.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle multiple outputs and their masks properly, leading to the error when trying to compute the output tensors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle multiple outputs and their masks. This may involve updating the logic for handling multiple outputs and ensuring that the tensor_map is correctly populated for all output tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            continue

        reference_input_tensors = layer.input
        reference_output_tensors = layer.output

        computed_data = []
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code should handle multiple outputs and their masks properly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post and passing the failing test.
