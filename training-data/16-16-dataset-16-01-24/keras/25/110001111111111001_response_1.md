The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect handling of data types when performing arithmetic operations. The function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified mode and data format. However, the arithmetic operations are causing data type mismatches, leading to the UFuncTypeError.

To fix the bug, the arithmetic operations need to be performed with the appropriate data types to ensure consistency and prevent type casting issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

In the corrected code:
1. The input array `x` is converted to `float32` using `np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)` to ensure consistent data types for arithmetic operations.
2. The mean and std arrays are also explicitly defined as `np.array` with `dtype=np.float32` to maintain data type consistency.
3. The arithmetic operations are performed using the appropriate data types to prevent type casting issues.

With these changes, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
