1. The buggy function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified data format and mode. It applies different preprocessing steps based on the mode provided.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'else' block where the 'caffe' mode is not handled properly.

3. The bug's cause is that the 'caffe' mode is not properly implemented in the function. It should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition for the 'caffe' mode and implement the required preprocessing steps for this mode.
   - Ensure that the preprocessing steps for each mode are correctly implemented and handle all possible scenarios.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode provided")

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected code, the 'caffe' mode is properly handled by implementing the required preprocessing steps for this mode. Additionally, an error is raised if an invalid mode is provided.
