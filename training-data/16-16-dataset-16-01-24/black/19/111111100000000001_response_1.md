The potential error in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it is not properly handling the conditions for checking if the previous line is a decorator, import, or yield. This is causing incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of conditions related to the previous line's attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. These conditions are not being properly checked, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to be inserted.

To fix the bug, the conditions related to the previous line's attributes need to be properly checked and handled to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the previous line's attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self)
        and not current_line.is_import(self)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield(self)
        and (not current_line.is_yield(self) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditions related to the previous line's attributes such as `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are properly checked using the `self` parameter to access the related functions. This ensures that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the previous line's attributes.
