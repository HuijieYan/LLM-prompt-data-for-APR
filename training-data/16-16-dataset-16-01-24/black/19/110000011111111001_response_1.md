The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle different cases based on the properties of the `current_line` input parameter. The function checks for various conditions and returns different values based on those conditions.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output of the function does not match the expected output. The specific discrepancy is related to the presence of empty lines in the output.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted. The function is not correctly handling the cases where empty lines need to be inserted before or after certain types of lines.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in different cases needs to be reviewed and corrected. This may involve adjusting the conditions and calculations for `newlines` and `before` variables based on the properties of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues identified in the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the given input parameters and conditions.
