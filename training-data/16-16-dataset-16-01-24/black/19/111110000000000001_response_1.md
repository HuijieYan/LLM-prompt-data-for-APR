The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it is not returning the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is also modifying the `prefix` attribute of the `first_leaf` object, which may not be intended.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the cases for different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yield, etc.) and not returning the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the different cases and return the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
        else:
            before = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles the different cases for decorators, flow control, imports, and yield, and returns the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the conditions.
