The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines in the code. The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions, but it seems to be producing incorrect results.

The failing test is showing that the expected and actual outputs are not matching, indicating that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in the code.

The potential error location within the function could be the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, etc.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line needs to be reviewed and corrected. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and other scenarios need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted as per the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function and ensure that it passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
