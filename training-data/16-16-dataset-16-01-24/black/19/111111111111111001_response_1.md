The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected and actual output of the `fs` function, and it is failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the number of empty lines in the actual output is not matching the expected output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the incorrect handling of conditions for inserting empty lines based on the type of line being processed.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different conditions needs to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields should be thoroughly checked to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function and ensure that it returns the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions specified in the failing test cases.
