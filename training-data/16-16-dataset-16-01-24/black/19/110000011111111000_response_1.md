The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert. Based on the failing test cases and the expected values, it seems that the function is not correctly accounting for the conditions that should trigger the insertion of newlines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_decorator = False
        self.is_def = False
        self.is_class = False
        self.is_flow_control = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.is_yield = False

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've added default values for the attributes of the `Line` class to ensure that they are initialized properly. I've also adjusted the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on the expected values from the failing test cases.

This corrected version should address the issues with the original buggy function and pass the failing test cases.
