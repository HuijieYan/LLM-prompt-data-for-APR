The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in the function, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to insert.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields needs to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line should be carefully evaluated and adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
