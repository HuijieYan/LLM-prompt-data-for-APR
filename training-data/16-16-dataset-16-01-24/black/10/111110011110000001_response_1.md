The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the expected and actual output of the function, but it fails with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not matching for the `contents_tab` input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the indentation and waiting for a new line. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new line characters, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new line characters, causing it to produce incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and new line characters, ensuring that the output matches the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and new line characters, and pass the failing test.
