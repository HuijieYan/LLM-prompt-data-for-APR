The bug in the function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before the specified column. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the case where the prefix ends before the specified column. We can do this by checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
