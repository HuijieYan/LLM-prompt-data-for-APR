The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column and handles whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 0
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected code should now handle the indentation level correctly and return the expected results for the failing test cases.
