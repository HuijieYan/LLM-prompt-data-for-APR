The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a newline character. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to the failing test.

To fix this, we need to update the logic for handling the newline character and indentation level. We also need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly set and reset based on the encountered characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and newline characters, and should return the expected results for the failing test cases.
