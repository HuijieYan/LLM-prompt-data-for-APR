1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It iterates through the prefix string character by character, keeping track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line. The function then returns the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition. It seems that the condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is not correctly implemented.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the case where the current column is less than the specified column. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition to correctly check if the current column is less than the specified column.
   - Ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column value.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition to include equal to
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
