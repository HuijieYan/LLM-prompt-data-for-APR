The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering a newline character. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to the failing test.

To fix this, we need to update the logic for handling the newline character and indentation level. We can do this by keeping track of the current indentation level and comparing it with the specified column. If the current indentation level is less than the specified column, we should return the consumed lines and the remaining prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the indentation level correctly and pass the failing test.
