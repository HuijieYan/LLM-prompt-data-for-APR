Potential error location: The function is not correctly handling the case where the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is not correctly updating the current line and column when encountering a new line character.
(b). The buggy class does not handle the case where the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column.
(c). The related functions do not provide a proper mechanism for handling the partial consumption of the prefix.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling new line characters to properly reset the current line and column.
2. Add a condition to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column, and handle it accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
