The issue with the current implementation is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset to `False` after processing a newline character. This causes the function to incorrectly handle subsequent characters. Additionally, the logic for updating the `current_column` variable is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after processing a newline character, and update the `current_column` variable correctly based on the type of character encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
