The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The function seems to have a bug related to handling indentation and new lines, which is causing the incorrect behavior.

The expected and actual input/output variable information shows that the function is not handling tab characters and new lines correctly, leading to incorrect indentation and unexpected behavior.

The GitHub issue also provides a similar problem where indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of tab characters and new lines, as well as the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line.

The bug's cause is likely related to the mishandling of tab characters and new lines, which is leading to incorrect indentation and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and new lines, and accurately track the current column and waiting for a new line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now properly handle tab characters and new lines, accurately track the current column, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
