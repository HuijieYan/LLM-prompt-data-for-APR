The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix and handling the indentation. The problem seems to be with the logic for handling tabs and spaces, as well as the handling of new lines.

The function should correctly identify the indentation level and adjust the comments accordingly. It should also handle tabs and spaces consistently.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces, as well as the logic for identifying the end of the indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle tabs and spaces, and to accurately identify the end of the indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
