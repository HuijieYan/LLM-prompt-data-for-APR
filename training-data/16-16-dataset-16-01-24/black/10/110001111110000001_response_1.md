The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, the issue seems to be with the logic for handling the indentation and new lines.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing because the function is not correctly handling the indentation and new lines in the input strings `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the indentation and new lines, specifically in the `wait_for_nl` condition and the `elif char == '\n'` condition.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation and new lines, leading to incorrect output and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation and new lines in the input prefix string. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and new lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and new lines, and pass the failing test.
