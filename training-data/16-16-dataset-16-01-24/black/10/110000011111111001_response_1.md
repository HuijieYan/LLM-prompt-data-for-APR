The issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix. It also does not handle the case where the prefix is completely consumed. 

To fix this, we need to update the function to correctly handle the indentation level and also check for the case where the prefix is completely consumed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and the case where the prefix is completely consumed.

This should fix the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
