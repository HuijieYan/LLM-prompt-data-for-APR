1. The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column, and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, it has several issues that need to be fixed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the wait_for_nl condition and the calculation of the current_column.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not correctly handle the wait_for_nl condition and the calculation of the current_column, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correctly handling the wait_for_nl condition to ensure that the function waits for a new line before consuming the prefix.
   - Fixing the calculation of the current_column to accurately track the column position in the prefix string.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the wait_for_nl condition is handled correctly, and the calculation of the current_column is fixed to accurately track the column position in the prefix string.
