The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on a given column value. The function seems to have a bug related to handling the indentation of comments.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing because the function is incorrectly changing the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The error message shows that the actual output is not matching the expected output for the given input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters when consuming the prefix string.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This is leading to incorrect output when consuming the prefix string, especially when dealing with comments and indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters. It should accurately track the current column and handle the indentation and newline characters based on the given column value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code should now accurately handle the indentation and newline characters, and it should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
