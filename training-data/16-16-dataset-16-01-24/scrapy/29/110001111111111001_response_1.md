The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None` when the scheme is not 'http' or 'https'. This causes an error when trying to concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` string.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the scheme is 'http' or 'https' before trying to access the `parsed.hostname` attribute. If the scheme is not 'http' or 'https', we can set the `host` variable to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = ''
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly and should pass the failing test.
