The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is using the `to_bytes` function to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes, but the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` in some cases, which causes an error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for it.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + (parsed.hostname or '').encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code handles the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default empty string value for it. This ensures that the `to_bytes` function does not throw an error when trying to convert it to bytes.
