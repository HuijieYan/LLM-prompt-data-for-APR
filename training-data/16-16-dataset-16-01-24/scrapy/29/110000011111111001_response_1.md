The issue in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed.hostname` is being used without checking if it exists. This causes an error when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before using it. If it does not exist, we can use an empty string instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle cases where `parsed.hostname` does not exist and pass the failing test.
