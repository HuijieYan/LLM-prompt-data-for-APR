1. The buggy function `request_httprepr` takes a request object and returns the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes. It uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request, and the `to_bytes` function to convert strings to bytes. It also uses the `urlunparse` function to reconstruct the URL.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the construction of the HTTP request string, including the method, path, headers, and body.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect construction of the HTTP request string, including the method, path, headers, and body. This could be due to incorrect usage of the related functions such as `urlparse_cached`, `to_bytes`, and `urlunparse`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the method, path, headers, and body are correctly formatted in the HTTP request string.
   - Checking the usage of the related functions to ensure they are providing the correct values for constructing the HTTP request.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for header, value in request.headers.items():
            s += header.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we use `urlparse` and `urlunparse` from the `urllib.parse` module to parse and reconstruct the URL. We also encode the strings to bytes using the `encode` method. Additionally, we iterate through the request headers to properly format them in the HTTP request string.
