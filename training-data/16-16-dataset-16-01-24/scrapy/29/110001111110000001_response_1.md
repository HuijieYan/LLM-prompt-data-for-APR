The potential error location within the problematic function is the `parsed.hostname` variable, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being properly handled when it is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it accordingly. We can also ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is converted to a string before passing it to the `to_bytes` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected code, the `parsed.hostname` is checked for existence before being used, and it is converted to a string before being passed to the `to_bytes` function. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
