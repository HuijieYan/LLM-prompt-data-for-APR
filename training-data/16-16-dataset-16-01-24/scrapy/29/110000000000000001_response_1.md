1. The buggy function takes a request object and attempts to return the raw HTTP representation of the request as bytes.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the concatenation of the request headers and body with the rest of the HTTP representation.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is trying to concatenate the request headers and body directly to the byte string without properly encoding them.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Encoding the request headers and body properly before concatenating them with the byte string.
   - Checking for the existence of headers and handling them accordingly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += str(request.headers).encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `encode` method to properly encode the strings before concatenating them with the byte strings. We have also used the `requests` library to parse the URL and access the request method, headers, and body.
