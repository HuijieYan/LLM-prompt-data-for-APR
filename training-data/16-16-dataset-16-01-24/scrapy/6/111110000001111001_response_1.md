The bug in the `convert_image` function is that it always tries to save the image as a JPEG, regardless of its original format. This causes issues when the input image is not in the RGB format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to save the image in its original format. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function will save the image in its original format and handle the case where the input image is in PNG format with an RGBA mode. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
