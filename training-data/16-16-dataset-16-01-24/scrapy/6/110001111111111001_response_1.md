The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the conversion of images with transparency correctly. When the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode, the function is creating a new background with a white color and then pasting the original image onto it. This results in the loss of transparency information.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle transparency correctly. We can use the `convert` method to convert the image to an RGB mode, which will automatically handle the transparency.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle images with transparency correctly and should pass the failing test.
