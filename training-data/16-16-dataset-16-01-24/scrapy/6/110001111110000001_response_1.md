The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a different format and size. The function first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', then it creates a new background image with a white color and pastes the original image onto it. After that, it converts the image to 'RGB'. If the image mode is not 'RGB', it directly converts the image to 'RGB'. Then, if a size is provided, it creates a thumbnail of the image with the specified size. Finally, it saves the image as a JPEG and returns the image and a buffer.

The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images with different formats and modes, as well as the creation of thumbnails.

The error message indicates that the test is failing when checking the colors of the converted images. It shows that the expected colors are not matching the actual colors.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of the image to 'RGB' when the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. This conversion seems to be incorrect, leading to the mismatch in colors.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion of images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode differently. We should also ensure that the colors are preserved during the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel
        image = Image.alpha_composite(Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255)), background)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we use the `alpha_composite` method to convert the RGBA image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel. We also use `ImageOps.exif_transpose` to ensure that the orientation of the image is preserved when creating a thumbnail. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
