The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. The function is expected to create a new image with a white background and then convert it to RGB mode. However, it is not doing so in the current implementation.

The failing test is checking for the color values of the converted image, and it is failing because the actual color values are different from the expected ones.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `convert_image` function to correctly handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now handle the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case correctly and pass the failing test.
