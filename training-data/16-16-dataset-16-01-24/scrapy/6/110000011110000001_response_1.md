1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a different format and size. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images with different formats and sizes. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the converted image does not match the expected result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The code inside this conditional block may not be correctly handling the conversion of images with these attributes.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode is not correctly converting the image to RGB mode, resulting in the incorrect output. This is evident from the failing test and error message, which show that the converted image does not match the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode correctly converts the image to RGB mode and handles transparency.
   - Checking the conversion logic for other image modes to ensure that the function handles all cases correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB if it's not already in RGB mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it to the specified size
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and pass the failing test.
