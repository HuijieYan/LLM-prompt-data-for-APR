1. The buggy function is part of the ImagesPipeline class, which is a subclass of FilesPipeline. The function is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the image.save(buf, 'JPEG') line, as it is trying to save the image as a JPEG format regardless of the original format of the image.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is trying to save the image as a JPEG format without considering the original format of the image. This can lead to errors if the original format is not compatible with JPEG.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the original format of the image and save it in the same format.
   - Add error handling for unsupported image formats.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the image.save() function now uses image.format to save the image in its original format. This ensures that the image is saved in the correct format without causing any errors.
