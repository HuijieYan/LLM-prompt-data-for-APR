1. The buggy function is a part of the scrapy/pipelines/images.py file and it is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the image.save() method, where the format is hardcoded to 'JPEG' regardless of the original image format.

3. The bug's cause is that the image is being saved as a JPEG regardless of its original format, which can lead to loss of quality and incorrect format conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the original image format and saving it in the same format.
   - Adding error handling for unsupported image formats.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)  # Save the image in its original format
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the image.save() method now uses the original image format instead of hardcoding it to 'JPEG'. This ensures that the image is saved in its original format, preventing loss of quality and incorrect format conversion.
