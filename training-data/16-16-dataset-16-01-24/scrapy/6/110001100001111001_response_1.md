The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. It is creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it, but then converting it to 'RGB' instead of 'RGBA'. This causes the function to return the wrong image in some cases.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. We also need to ensure that the function returns the correct image and buffer in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct image and buffer in all cases, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
