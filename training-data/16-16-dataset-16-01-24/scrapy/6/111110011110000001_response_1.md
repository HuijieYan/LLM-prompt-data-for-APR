The buggy function is `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class. The function is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images to ensure they are in the correct mode and size.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The function then creates a new background and pastes the image onto it, converting it to 'RGB'. This conditional statement might not be handling the transparency of the image correctly, leading to the failing test.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling transparency correctly when converting images from 'PNG' with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB'. This results in the failing test, as the converted image does not match the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle transparency correctly when converting images from 'PNG' with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB'. This can be achieved by using the `Image.alpha_composite` method to handle transparency.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now handle transparency correctly when converting images, and it should pass the failing test.
