The buggy function is `request_body_to_args` which is used to convert the request body to arguments. The failing test functions are `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`. All of these tests are failing with the same error message, which is `assert response.status_code == 200`. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of form data for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. It seems that the function is not correctly handling these non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data. This is causing the response status code to be 422 instead of the expected 200.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data. This may involve checking the type of the received data and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code should handle non-typing sequences correctly when they are passed as form data and should pass the failing tests.
