1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments. The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are testing the behavior of the function when receiving form data with repeated keys. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200. The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of FastAPI when handling repeated keys in form data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the form data, which is causing the function to return unprocessable entity status codes.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data, leading to validation errors and incorrect status codes. The failing tests are trying to send form data with repeated keys, but the function is not handling them properly, resulting in validation errors and incorrect status codes. The GitHub issue also highlights the expected behavior when dealing with repeated keys in form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and convert them into lists before validation.
   - Update the function to follow the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, where repeated keys are collected and assigned as a list before validation.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code modifies the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and convert them into lists before validation. This change should allow the function to pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
