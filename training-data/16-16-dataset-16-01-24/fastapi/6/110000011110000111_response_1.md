1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body and validating them against the required parameters. The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are testing the behavior of the function when receiving form data with repeated keys. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200. The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the form data, which is causing the validation to fail.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data. It is only validating against the last value instead of collecting all values for the same key and assigning them as a list before validation. This is in line with the GitHub issue, which suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to collect all values for the same key in the form data and assign them as a list before validation.
   - Update the validation logic to handle lists of values for the same key.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code now correctly handles repeated keys in the form data by using `getlist` to retrieve all values for the same key and assigning them as a list before validation. This change should resolve the failing tests and also address the issue raised in the GitHub post.
