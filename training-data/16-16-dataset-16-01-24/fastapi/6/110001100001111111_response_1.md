The issue seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation only captures the last key=value pair, which is not the expected behavior. The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the form data. The function should be modified to capture all values for a repeated key and assign them to a list before validation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data. It only captures the last value for a repeated key, which does not align with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for repeated keys in the form data and assign the values to a list for the same key before validation. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are captured and validated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code captures all values for a repeated key and assigns them to a list before validation, ensuring that all values are captured and validated correctly. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and align with the expected input/output variable information provided.
