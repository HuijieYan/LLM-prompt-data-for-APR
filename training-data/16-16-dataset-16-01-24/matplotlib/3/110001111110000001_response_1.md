The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. This method is responsible for resetting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which is expected to return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is likely causing the `is_filled` method to always return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass.
