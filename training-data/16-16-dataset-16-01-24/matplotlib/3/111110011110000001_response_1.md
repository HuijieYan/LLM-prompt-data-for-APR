1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class and is responsible for setting various attributes of the marker style. The failing test is trying to check if the marker style is filled or not, but it is failing with an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. This is where the failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not.

3. The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method is not implemented in the MarkerStyle class, which is why the failing test is failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value.

4. To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be implemented in the MarkerStyle class to return the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute that is being set in the `_recache` method.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With the `is_filled` method implemented in the MarkerStyle class, the failing test should now pass.
