1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is responsible for recalculating the marker style attributes. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case when the _marker_function is None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for self._marker_function being None. If it is None, the function should not proceed with the recalculation.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case when self._marker_function is None. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it.
   - If self._marker_function is None, simply return without performing any recalculation.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it. If it is None, the function simply returns without performing any recalculation. This should fix the bug and prevent any unexpected behavior or errors.
