1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class. It is intended to recache certain attributes when called. However, there are several attributes being reset to default values, and a marker function is called without checking if it exists.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the marker function is called without checking if it exists.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is assuming the marker function exists without checking, and it is resetting attributes to default values without any condition.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the marker function exists before calling it.
   - Add conditions to only reset attributes if necessary.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
