1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class. This method is supposed to recache the marker style attributes, but it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to verify that the marker is not filled when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it is failing. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not be.

The GitHub issue is reporting that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is not being correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function:
       The `_recache` method is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

   (b). The buggy class:
       The `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter to determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

   (c). The failing test and error message:
       The failing test is trying to verify that the marker is not filled when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it is failing because the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not be.

   (d). The GitHub Issue information:
       The GitHub issue is reporting that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_recache` method to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
   - Update the `MarkerStyle` class to handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly and ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the desired marker fill style.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the `_recache` method now correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and also make the failing test pass.
