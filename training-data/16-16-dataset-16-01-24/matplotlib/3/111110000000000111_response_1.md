1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class, which is used to customize markers in matplotlib. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow using the fillstyle parameter, but the desired result is not achieved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _marker_function is called. It seems that this function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not correctly handling the marker's fillstyle parameter, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to set markers to be hollow.
   (b). The MarkerStyle class is not properly recaching the marker properties when the _recache function is called, leading to incorrect marker rendering.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that the user is trying to set markers to be hollow using the fillstyle parameter, but the desired result is not achieved.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the marker properties are correctly recached.
   (b). Check the _marker_function to ensure that it correctly handles the fillstyle parameter and updates the marker properties accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the _filled attribute to False, the markers will be rendered as hollow when using the MarkerStyle class with the fillstyle parameter set to 'none'. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
