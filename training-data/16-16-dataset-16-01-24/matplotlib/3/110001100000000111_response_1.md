1. The buggy function _recache is responsible for reinitializing the marker style attributes. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow using markers.MarkerStyle() and setting the fillstyle to 'none' when using ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line self._marker_function(), as it is attempting to call a function that may not exist or may not be properly defined.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is not properly reinitializing the marker style attributes, which is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user is trying to set the fillstyle to 'none' but is not getting the desired result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the _marker_function exists and is properly defined before calling it.
   - Ensure that the _recache function properly reinitializes the marker style attributes, including the fillstyle.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check to ensure that _marker_function exists and is callable before calling it, the corrected code addresses the potential issue of calling a non-existent or improperly defined function. This should help resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post related to setting markers to be hollow.
