1. The buggy function is a method called `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is located in the `test_marker.py` file within the `matplotlib/tests` directory. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value. The GitHub issue describes a situation where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the line `self._marker_function()`, as it seems to be responsible for setting the filled state of the marker.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected. The failing test is checking for the filled state of the marker, and the error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value. The GitHub issue further confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the implementation of the `_recache` function to ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly handled.
   - Checking the implementation of the `is_filled` method to ensure it accurately reflects the filled state of the marker.
   - Investigating the relationship between the `fillstyle` parameter and the marker's filled state to identify any discrepancies.

5. Corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled state based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly updates the filled state based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers as expected.
