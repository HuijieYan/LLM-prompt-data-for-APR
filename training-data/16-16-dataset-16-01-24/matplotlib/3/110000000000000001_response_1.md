1. The buggy function is a method that is supposed to reset several attributes to their default values and then call a marker function. However, the bug is that it is not resetting the attributes properly and is not handling the case when the marker function is not defined.

2. The potential error location is in the assignment of default values to the attributes.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly resetting the attributes to their default values and is not handling the case when the marker function is not defined.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the marker function is defined before calling it
   - Reset the attributes to their default values properly

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
