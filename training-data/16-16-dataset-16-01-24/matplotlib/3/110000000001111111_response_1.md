The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not being properly handled when creating a custom MarkerStyle. The fillstyle parameter is not being considered in the _recache function, which is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when set to 'none'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally. This is likely causing the markers to always be filled, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.

The bug's cause is that the _filled variable is being set to True unconditionally, which is not consistent with the expected behavior when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _recache function to consider the fillstyle parameter when setting the _filled variable. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will now properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the _filled variable accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
