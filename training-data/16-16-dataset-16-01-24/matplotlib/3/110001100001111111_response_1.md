The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not working as expected when creating a custom MarkerStyle and setting fillstyle to 'none'. This is likely due to the _recache function not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the _filled variable to True regardless of the fillstyle parameter, which is causing the markers to be filled even when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The bug's cause is that the _recache function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter, leading to the markers being filled when they should be hollow.

To fix the bug, the _recache function should be modified to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter. If fillstyle is set to 'none', then _filled should be set to False to ensure that the markers are hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function will correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that markers are hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and ensure that markers are displayed as hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting fillstyle to 'none'.
