1. The buggy function is a method called _recache, which is part of a class that seems to be related to markers in a plotting library. The failing test is testing the fillstyle of a marker, and the error message indicates that the is_filled method is not returning the expected value. The GitHub issue also mentions a similar problem with setting markers to be hollow.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the marker to be filled by default, which contradicts the intention of setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

3. The bug's cause is that the _recache function is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter, leading to markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This is evident from the failing test and the GitHub issue, which both indicate that setting the fillstyle to 'none' does not produce the expected result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the implementation of the _recache function to ensure that the fillstyle parameter is being correctly handled.
   - Modifying the _recache function to properly handle the fillstyle parameter and set the marker to be hollow when fillstyle is 'none'.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the _recache function now checks the fillstyle parameter and sets the marker to be hollow when fillstyle is 'none'. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
