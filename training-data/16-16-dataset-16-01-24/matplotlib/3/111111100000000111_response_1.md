1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function is responsible for recaching the marker style attributes. The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow using the fillstyle parameter, but the desired result is not achieved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the _marker_function() is called. This function is being called without being defined or assigned, which could be causing the issue.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not properly defined to handle the _marker_function().
   (b). The MarkerStyle class may not be correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.
   (c). The related functions may not be properly interacting with the MarkerStyle class.
   (d). The GitHub issue information indicates that the fillstyle parameter is not producing the expected result when trying to create hollow markers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Define the _marker_function() within the MarkerStyle class to properly handle marker functions.
   (b). Ensure that the fillstyle parameter is correctly implemented within the MarkerStyle class.
   (c). Verify that the related functions are interacting with the MarkerStyle class and its attributes correctly.
   (d). Investigate the fillstyle parameter to ensure it is functioning as expected.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            if self._marker_function:  # Call _marker_function if defined
                self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks if the _marker_function is defined before calling it, ensuring that it does not cause an error. This should help resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
