The issue is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_filled` attribute will only be set to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not empty and not equal to `'none'`. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
