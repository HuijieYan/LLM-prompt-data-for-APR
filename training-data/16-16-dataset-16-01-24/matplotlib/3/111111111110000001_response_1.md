The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. This is because the `is_filled` method is not properly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, which causes the test to fail.

The bug's cause is that the `is_filled` method is not defined in the `MarkerStyle` class, so when the test tries to call this method, it fails.

To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class. This method should return the value of the `_filled` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method is now implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class, and it returns the value of the `_filled` attribute. This will allow the failing test to pass.
