The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes the failing test because `is_filled()` returns `True` even when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this, we need to check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now check the value of `self._fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly. This will ensure that the failing test will pass, and the expected input/output variable information will be satisfied.
