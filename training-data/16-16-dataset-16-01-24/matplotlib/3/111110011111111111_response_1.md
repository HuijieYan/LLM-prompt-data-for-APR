The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the `is_filled()` method should return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved, and the markers should appear hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.
