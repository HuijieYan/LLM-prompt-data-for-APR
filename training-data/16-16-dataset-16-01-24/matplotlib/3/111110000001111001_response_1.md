The issue with the buggy function is that it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of its initial value. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output values.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, as expected.
