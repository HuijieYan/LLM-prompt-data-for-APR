1. The buggy function `_recache` is called when the `marker_function` is not None. It resets several attributes of the object and then calls the `marker_function`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if it is filled or not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._filled = True`. This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the issue when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This causes the failing test to assert `not True`, resulting in the AssertionError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
   - Update the `_recache` function to handle different `fillstyle` values and set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now check the `fillstyle` attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
