1. The buggy function is a method that is part of a class, and it seems to be related to marker styling in a plotting library. The GitHub issue is about setting markers to be hollow, but the fillstyle parameter is not working as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()` which is supposed to be called when the marker function is not None, but it is not clear what this function is supposed to do.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of marker styling within the `_recache` function. The GitHub issue also indicates that the fillstyle parameter is not working as expected, which could be related to the buggy function not correctly handling marker styling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the implementation of the `_marker_function` and ensuring it is correctly handling marker styling.
   - Reviewing the usage of the fillstyle parameter and ensuring it is being applied correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected code checks if the `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, which should prevent any issues related to incorrect handling of marker styling.
