```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```
The issue was that the function was not checking if the marker function was not None before executing it. Also, the _filled attribute should be set to False to make the marker hollow.
