1. The buggy function is part of the MarkerStyle class in the markers.py file of the matplotlib library. The function _recache is intended to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object, and then call the _marker_function. The failing test is checking the behavior of the is_filled method of the MarkerStyle object, and it fails with an assertion error. The GitHub issue indicates that setting fillstyle to 'none' does not result in hollow markers when using ax.scatter().

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._marker_function()`. It seems that this line is intended to call a method to update the marker style, but it is not properly implemented.

3. The bug's cause is that the _marker_function is not being properly called or defined, leading to unexpected behavior when setting fillstyle to 'none'. The failing test indicates that the is_filled method is returning True when it should be False, which suggests that the marker is not being properly set to hollow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the _marker_function and ensure that it properly updates the marker style based on the fillstyle parameter.
   - Update the _recache function to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and ensure that the marker is properly set to hollow when fillstyle is 'none'.
   - Verify that the MarkerStyle class is correctly interacting with the fillstyle parameter and that the is_filled method returns the expected result.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
            if self._marker_function is not None:
                self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. The MarkerStyle class will correctly handle the fillstyle parameter, and the markers should appear as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none`.
