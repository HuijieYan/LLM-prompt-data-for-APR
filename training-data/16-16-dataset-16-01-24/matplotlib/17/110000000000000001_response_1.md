1. The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in the initial endpoints (vmin and vmax), along with optional parameters expander, tiny, and increasing. The function checks for finite values, swaps vmin and vmax if necessary, and expands the interval if it is too small.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the maxabsvalue and the subsequent conditionals that modify vmin and vmax based on the interval size.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditionals for modifying vmin and vmax based on the interval size are not correctly handling the cases where the interval is too small.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Revise the conditionals for modifying vmin and vmax to ensure they cover all edge cases and correctly handle the interval size.
   - Check for potential division by zero errors when calculating maxabsvalue.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) < tiny:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the conditional for modifying vmin and vmax based on the interval size has been revised to handle the edge cases and correctly adjust the endpoints. Additionally, a check for the absolute difference being less than tiny has been added to ensure proper expansion of the interval.
