The problematic function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the colorbar functionality and is encountering runtime warnings related to overflow and scalar subtraction.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue` using the `max` function and the subsequent comparison of `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `max` function is being used to calculate `maxabsvalue`, and it is not handling the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` correctly. This is leading to incorrect comparisons and subsequent overflow and scalar subtraction warnings.

To fix the bug, the `max` function should be replaced with a conditional statement to correctly calculate `maxabsvalue` based on the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`. Additionally, the comparison of `vmax - vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny` should be adjusted to avoid overflow and scalar subtraction warnings.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = abs_vmax if abs_vmax > abs_vmin else abs_vmin

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected code, the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test without encountering any overflow or scalar subtraction warnings.
