1. The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It takes in parameters `vmin` and `vmax` as the initial endpoints, and also has optional parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The function checks for finite values of `vmin` and `vmax`, swaps the values if `vmax` is less than `vmin`, and then expands the interval if it is too small.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks if the interval is smaller than the threshold `tiny` and needs to be expanded.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition for expanding the interval is not correctly handling the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. This can lead to incorrect expansion of the interval.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a separate condition to check if both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero and handle it appropriately.
   - Refactoring the logic for expanding the interval to ensure that it covers all edge cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny:
            vmin -= expander
            vmax += expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to handle the case where both `vmin` and `vmax` are close to zero. If both are close to zero, the interval is expanded by subtracting and adding the `expander` value, respectively. This ensures that the interval is correctly expanded in all cases.
