The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect comparison of the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` with `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This comparison should be based on the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` and not on the absolute value of `maxabsvalue` multiplied by `tiny`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison in the `nonsingular` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
