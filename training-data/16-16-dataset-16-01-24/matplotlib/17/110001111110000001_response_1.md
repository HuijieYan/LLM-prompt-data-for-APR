The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The function takes in parameters `vmin` and `vmax` as the initial endpoints, and it also has optional parameters `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. The function checks for finite values of `vmin` and `vmax`, and then performs some calculations to modify the endpoints if necessary.

The failing test `test_colorbar_int` is testing the `colorbar` function, which in turn calls the `nonsingular` function. The error message indicates that there are runtime warnings for overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute, which are occurring within the `nonsingular` function.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is likely in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the subsequent conditional statements that modify `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations within the `nonsingular` function do not result in overflow errors. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional statements and the calculations for `maxabsvalue` to handle extreme values more effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function should now pass the failing test without encountering any overflow errors.
