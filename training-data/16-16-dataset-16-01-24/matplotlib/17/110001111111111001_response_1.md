The issue in the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle the case where `vmin` and `vmax` are very large or very small, leading to overflow errors. The function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities, but it fails to do so in certain cases.

The failing test is related to the `nonsingular` function because it calls this function to process the values for `vmin` and `vmax`. The error message indicates that there are overflow errors and runtime warnings encountered in the `nonsingular` function.

The expected and actual input/output variable information shows that the function is not handling extreme values properly, leading to overflow and runtime warnings.

To fix the bug, the `nonsingular` function needs to be modified to handle extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` properly. This can be done by checking for extreme values and taking appropriate actions to avoid overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function should handle extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` properly, avoiding overflow errors and runtime warnings. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test.
