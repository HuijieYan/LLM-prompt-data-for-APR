1. The buggy function is an initialization function that takes a parameter make_current. If make_current is None, it checks if an IOLoop instance exists and if not, it calls the make_current method. If make_current is True, it checks if an IOLoop instance exists and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements and the logic for checking and creating an IOLoop instance.

3. The bug's cause is that the logic for checking and creating an IOLoop instance is not properly implemented, leading to potential errors and incorrect behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the make_current method is properly defined and called.
   - Ensure that the logic for checking and creating an IOLoop instance is correct and handles all possible cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the logic for checking and creating an IOLoop instance is fixed. The make_current method is called only if make_current is None and an IOLoop instance does not exist. If make_current is True, it checks if an IOLoop instance exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does, otherwise, it calls the make_current method.
