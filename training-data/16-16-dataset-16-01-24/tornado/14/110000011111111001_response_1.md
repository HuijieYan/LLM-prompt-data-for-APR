The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, make the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. We can do this by checking if `make_current` is True and if an IOLoop instance already exists, then raise the RuntimeError. If `make_current` is True and no IOLoop instance exists, then we can proceed to make the current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test.
