The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop is None and then raises a RuntimeError if it is None. This is contradictory because if `make_current` is True, it should not raise an error if the current IOLoop is None.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and will not raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop is None.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
