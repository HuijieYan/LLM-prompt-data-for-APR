The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with the logic at line 252, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked, and then a RuntimeError is raised if `make_current` is True.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement at line 252, where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the conditional statement is contradictory. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it should not raise a RuntimeError, but the current logic does so when `make_current` is True.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement at line 252 should be modified to handle the cases where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and `make_current` is True separately. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and `make_current` is True, then it should raise a RuntimeError. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and `make_current` is None or False, then it should call `self.make_current()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code handles the cases where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and `make_current` is True separately, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
