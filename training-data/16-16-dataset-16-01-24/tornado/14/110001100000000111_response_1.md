The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and if it is None, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError, otherwise it calls `self.make_current()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current`.

The bug's cause is that the logic in the conditional statements is not consistent with the intended behavior. The GitHub issue points out that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it should not raise a RuntimeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the logic in the conditional statements to correctly handle the cases where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.
2. Ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the GitHub issue description.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement `elif make_current` has been changed to `else` to ensure that the correct behavior is followed. Additionally, the logic for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None has been adjusted to match the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue.
