1. The buggy function is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the IOLoop. It takes an argument `make_current` which, if set to `True`, should make the IOLoop the current IOLoop. If set to `False`, it should not try to become the current IOLoop. If not provided, it should become the current IOLoop only if there is no current IOLoop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the current instance of `IOLoop`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements are not handling the cases properly. The first conditional statement is checking if `make_current` is `None`, but it should also check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. The second conditional statement is checking if `make_current` is `True`, but it should also check if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check in the first conditional statement to see if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.
   - Modify the second conditional statement to check if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other functions)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
