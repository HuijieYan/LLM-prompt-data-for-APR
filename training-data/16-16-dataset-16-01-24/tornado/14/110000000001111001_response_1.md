The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is not correctly implemented.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the `make_current` parameter and the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current.
