The bug in the initialize function is that it is trying to call the current function from the IOLoop class without referencing the class itself. Additionally, the make_current function is being called without referencing the self parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to reference the current function and the make_current function from the IOLoop class using the self parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the initialize function should now work as expected and satisfy the provided input/output variable information.
