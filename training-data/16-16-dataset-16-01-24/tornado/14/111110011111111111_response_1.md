The issue in the buggy function is that when `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop is None and then raises a RuntimeError if it is None. This is contradictory because if `make_current` is True, it should not raise an error if the current IOLoop is None.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current` is True, it should only call `self.make_current()` without checking if the current IOLoop is None.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the RuntimeError will not be raised when it is not necessary.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
