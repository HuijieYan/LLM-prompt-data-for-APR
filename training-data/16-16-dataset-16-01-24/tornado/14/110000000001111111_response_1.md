The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then make it the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling the True case properly.

The GitHub issue title "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" indicates that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the function at line 252, where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None or not None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif block where make_current is True. The function is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the True case. We can remove the check for None and directly call self.make_current() when make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the case when make_current is True and will not raise a RuntimeError when the current IOLoop instance already exists. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
