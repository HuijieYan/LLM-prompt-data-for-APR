The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the `make_current` condition. The error message indicates that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning None, but the code is still raising a RuntimeError for "current IOLoop already exists".

The cause of the bug is that the `make_current` condition is not properly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None. This is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `make_current` condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If it is None, then we can proceed with making the current IOLoop, otherwise, we should raise the RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will now properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None and will only raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop already exists.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
