The issue with the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, make the current instance. However, the current implementation is not handling this logic correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that it only makes the current instance if there isn't already one.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it will make the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it will check if there is already a current instance and raise an error if there is, otherwise, it will make the current instance.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
