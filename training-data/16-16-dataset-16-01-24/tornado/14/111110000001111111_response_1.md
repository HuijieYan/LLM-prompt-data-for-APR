The issue in the `initialize` function is that it is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` properly. It should raise an error in this case, but it is not doing so.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking the condition `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` together.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
