The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is contradictory to the intended logic.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True. It should only raise a RuntimeError if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True. It should only raise a RuntimeError if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
