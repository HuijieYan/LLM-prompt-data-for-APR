The issue in the buggy function is that the logic for checking whether the current IOLoop exists or not is incorrect. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop and make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True. However, the current logic is flawed and does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists.

The problem lies in the `initialize` function's conditional statements. When `make_current` is True, it checks if the current IOLoop is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is incorrect because if `make_current` is True, it should always try to make the IOLoop current, regardless of whether it already exists or not.

To fix this issue, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is True, without checking if the current IOLoop already exists. This resolves the issue posted on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected.

The corrected code simplifies the logic by directly calling `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is None or True, which aligns with the intended behavior of the function.
