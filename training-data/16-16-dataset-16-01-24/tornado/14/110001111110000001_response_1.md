1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, and it takes an optional argument `make_current`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, it calls the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is provided and is True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if it exists when `make_current` is True.

3. The bug's cause is that the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True. The failing test is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if the current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised incorrectly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one when `make_current` is True.
   - If the current IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is True, raise a `RuntimeError`.
   - If the current IOLoop instance does not exist and `make_current` is True, call the `make_current` function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True, and it should pass the failing test.
