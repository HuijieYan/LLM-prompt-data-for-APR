1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. It is called with the argument `make_current=True` in the failing test `test_force_current`. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement `if make_current`. It checks if `make_current` is True and then checks if the current `IOLoop` exists. If it does, it raises a RuntimeError.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists. This is evident from the failing test, which expects a RuntimeError to be raised in this scenario.

4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists. It should not attempt to make the current `IOLoop` in this case and should raise a RuntimeError instead.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will check if `make_current` is True and if the current `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, it will raise a RuntimeError as expected in the failing test.
