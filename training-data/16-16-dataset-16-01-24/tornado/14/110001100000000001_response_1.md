1. The buggy function "initialize" is checking if the "make_current" parameter is None, and if so, it calls the "make_current" function. If "make_current" is not None, it checks if "IOLoop.current" is None and then calls "make_current" function. However, the "IOLoop.current" function is not being called correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of "IOLoop.current(instance=False)".

3. The bug's cause is that the "IOLoop.current" function is not being called correctly. It should be called as "current(instance=False)" instead of "IOLoop.current(instance=False)".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the call to "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" to "current(instance=False)".
   - Ensure that the "make_current" function is defined and accessible within the scope of the "initialize" function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
