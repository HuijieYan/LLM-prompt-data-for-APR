The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop and making it the current IOLoop if necessary. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` because it detects that a current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the conditional statement that checks whether a current IOLoop already exists. If `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation is raising the `RuntimeError` even if `make_current` is None and there is no current IOLoop.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is None. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `initialize` method needs to be modified to properly handle the case when `make_current` is None. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the conditional statement now correctly checks if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop already exists before raising a `RuntimeError`. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also pass the failing test.
