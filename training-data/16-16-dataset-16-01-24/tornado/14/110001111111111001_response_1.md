The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function is also not correctly calling the `make_current` function.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and then it expects that calling `IOLoop.current()` will return the same instance. However, the buggy function is not handling this case correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `make_current` is True and if the current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it should raise a RuntimeError. If it doesn't, it should call the `make_current` function to create the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, preventing the RuntimeError from being raised. This should make the failing test pass.
