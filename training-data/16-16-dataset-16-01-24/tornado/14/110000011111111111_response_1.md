The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case when make_current is True. The function is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, then create a new one. However, the current implementation is not handling this logic properly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with make_current=True, and then it expects that a second attempt to create an IOLoop instance with make_current=True should raise a RuntimeError. However, the current implementation of the buggy function is not handling this case correctly, leading to the test failure.

The GitHub issue is also pointing out the discrepancy in the logic of the function, where it is checking for IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, but still raising "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when make_current is True. It should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, then create a new one. If an instance already exists and make_current is True, then it should raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the make_current parameter correctly and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
