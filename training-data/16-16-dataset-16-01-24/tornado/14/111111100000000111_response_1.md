The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which, if set to `True`, should make the current IOLoop instance. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks whether a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` method, specifically in the conditional statements that check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

The bug's cause is that the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if a current IOLoop instance exists and raise an error if it does, but the current logic is doing the opposite.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` method need to be adjusted to correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` argument accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
