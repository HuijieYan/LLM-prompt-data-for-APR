The issue in the buggy function is that the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists is incorrect. The function is not properly checking if the IOLoop is already initialized before trying to make it current.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `initialize` function, specifically in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is not correctly checking if the IOLoop is already initialized.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when the IOLoop is already initialized. The GitHub issue also points out this discrepancy, where the function is raising an error for "current IOLoop already exists" even when it is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the IOLoop is already initialized. We can also simplify the logic to make it more readable.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the IOLoop is already initialized before trying to make it current. If it is already initialized, it will raise an error as expected. If it is not initialized, it will proceed to make it current. This code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
