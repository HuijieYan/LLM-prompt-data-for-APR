The buggy function is a part of a class and is used to initialize an IOLoop instance. The issue on GitHub suggests that on line 252, the function checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and if it is, it raises a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". This seems contradictory, as it should only raise the error if the IOLoop.current is not None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif statement where it checks if make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None. If the IOLoop.current is not None, it should raise the RuntimeError, but the current implementation does the opposite.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the elif statement is incorrect. It should raise the RuntimeError if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None, but the current implementation does the opposite.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the elif statement to correctly handle the case where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and raise the RuntimeError if it is. This resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
