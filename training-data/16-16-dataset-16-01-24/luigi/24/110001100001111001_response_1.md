The potential error in the buggy function is the way the command list is being constructed. The current implementation is not adding the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the command list is being constructed. We should add the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
