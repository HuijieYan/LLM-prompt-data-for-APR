The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The issue arises from the fact that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value in the command list.

The failing test cases are failing because the expected command list includes quoted property-value pairs, while the actual command list does not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs. This should make the failing test cases pass.
