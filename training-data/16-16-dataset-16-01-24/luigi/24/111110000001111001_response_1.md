The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the entire key-value pair, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly format the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided for both Case 1 and Case 2.
