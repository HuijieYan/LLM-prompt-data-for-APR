The problematic function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The bug is caused by the function adding double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This results in the test failing because the expected command list does not have the double quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should not add double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. Instead, it should simply add the property and value as separate elements in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will generate a command list without double quotes around the property and value, which should make it pass the failing test.
