The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the use of double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the actual output to differ from the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. The function is using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not necessary and causing the actual output to differ from the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when adding the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for the given test cases.
