The buggy function is `_dict_arg` and it is being used in the test functions `test_run` and `test_defaults` in the file `test/contrib/spark_test.py`. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the format of the command list being generated by the `_dict_arg` function and the expected command list in the test functions.

The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the line where the command is being constructed using the `name` and `value` parameters. The issue seems to be related to the formatting of the command list.

The bug's cause is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This is causing a mismatch with the expected command list in the test functions.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes around the values in the command list need to be removed. The corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, and it should pass the failing test.
