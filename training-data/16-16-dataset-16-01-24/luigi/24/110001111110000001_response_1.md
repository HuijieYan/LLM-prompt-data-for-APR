The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This is causing the test to fail as it is expecting the command list without the double quotes.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the property and value to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` and using `val` instead of `value` for the value of the property, the function will now generate the command list without the double quotes.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test cases.
