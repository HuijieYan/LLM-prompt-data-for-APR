1. The buggy function is a method within the SparkSubmitTask class. It is intended to take a name and a dictionary of properties as input, and then construct a command to be used for running a Spark job.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the command is being constructed using the name and value from the input dictionary.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the for loop. This is causing the loop variable to overwrite the input parameter, leading to incorrect command construction.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Renaming the loop variable to something other than "value" to avoid overwriting the input parameter.
   - Using a different approach to construct the command, such as using a list comprehension.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed loop variable to "val"
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Used "val" instead of "value"
        return command
```
