1. The buggy function takes in three parameters: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to create a command list.

2. The potential error location is within the for loop where the function is trying to concatenate the name, property, and value into the command list.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for the input parameter and the loop variable, which is causing confusion and overwriting the original value.

4. To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable to something different from the input parameter. Additionally, we can simplify the code by using f-strings for string formatting.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
