The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This is causing the test to fail because the expected command list does not have the double quotes.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
