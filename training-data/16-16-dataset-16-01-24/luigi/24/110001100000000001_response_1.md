1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value`, and if the `value` is a dictionary, it constructs a command by iterating through the dictionary items and appending them to the `command` list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where it is trying to concatenate the `name` and formatted string to the `command` list.

3. The bug's cause is that the variable `value` is being used for both the input value and the dictionary value in the for loop, causing a conflict and overwriting the original value. This is evident from the related function `name` which is not used in the buggy function but is defined in the same file.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Rename the variable `value` in the for loop to something else to avoid conflict with the input value.
   - Use a different approach to construct the command list without overwriting the original value.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```
