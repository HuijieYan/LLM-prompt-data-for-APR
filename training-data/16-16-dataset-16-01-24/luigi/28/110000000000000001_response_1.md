1. The buggy function is a method that checks if a table exists in a database. It takes the table name, database name, and an optional partition as input. It then runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table and returns a boolean value based on the result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block where the Hive command is being constructed. There might be an issue with the formatting of the Hive command string.

3. The bug's cause is that the Hive command in the else block is not being constructed correctly, which may result in an error when running the command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the formatting of the Hive command string in the else block to ensure it is constructed properly.
   - Verify that the partition_spec method is returning the correct partition specification.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```
