The potential error in the buggy function is in the `table_exists` function. The issue seems to be with the condition where `stdout` is checked for truthiness. The function is returning the opposite of what is expected in the test cases.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. The function is returning the opposite of what is expected in the test cases. Additionally, the `partition_spec` function is being called incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where `stdout` is checked for truthiness and also fix the way the `partition_spec` function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
