1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights the problem with case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The issue suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout`.
   - Update the comparison logic to be case insensitive.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of the table name with `stdout` is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for existing tables in Hive.
