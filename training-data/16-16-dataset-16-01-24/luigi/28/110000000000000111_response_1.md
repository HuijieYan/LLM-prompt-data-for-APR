1. The buggy function is a method for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The GitHub issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, where tables defined with capitalized names may not be found when checking for their existence due to Hive being case insensitive.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The comparison is case sensitive, which causes issues when the table names are in different cases.

3. The bug's cause is that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case sensitive, leading to false negatives when checking for the existence of tables with capitalized names.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
   - Using a case-insensitive comparison method to check for the existence of the table.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check for table existence case insensitive. This resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
