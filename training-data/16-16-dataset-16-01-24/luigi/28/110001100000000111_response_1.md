The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which may cause issues if the table name is in a different case than the output.

The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are not directly related to the bug, but they are called within the `table_exists` function to execute Hive commands and handle partition specifications.

The GitHub issue (#896) highlights the problem with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command, making the comparison case insensitive and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
