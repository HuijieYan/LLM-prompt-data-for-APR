The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of a class, and it checks whether a table exists in a given database and partition. The failing test `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the behavior of the `table_exists` method. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the method is not returning the expected results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems that the comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the test to fail when the table name is in a different case than the expected output.

The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` method is not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This is causing the test to fail when the table name's case does not match the expected output.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the method returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected code converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive.

With this correction, the `table_exists` method should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue. The corrected code ensures that the method handles case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in the database.
