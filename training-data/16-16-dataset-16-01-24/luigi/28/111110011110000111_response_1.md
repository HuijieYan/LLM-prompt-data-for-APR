The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database, and it has a conditional statement to handle the case when a partition is provided.

The failing test is checking the behavior of the `table_exists` function, and the error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected results.

The GitHub issue suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table, as Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the conditional statement that checks the stdout against the table name. It seems that the comparison is case sensitive, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and aligns with the behavior of Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and also address the issue raised in the GitHub post.
