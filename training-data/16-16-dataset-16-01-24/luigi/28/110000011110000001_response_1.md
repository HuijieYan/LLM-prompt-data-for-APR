The buggy function is `table_exists` which is a method of a class. The function takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition parameter. It then runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database and partition.

The failing test `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the `table_exists` method of the client object. The error message indicates that the test is failing because it expects `True` but is getting `False` instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It seems that the condition is not being evaluated correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly. It is not properly checking for the existence of the table in the database and partition.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in the specified database and partition, and return the appropriate boolean value. This should make the failing test pass.
