The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not converting the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout, making it case insensitive.

This corrected code will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
