The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test due to case sensitivity. The function is not handling the case insensitivity of table names in the Hive database, which causes the test to fail when checking for table existence.

The issue is related to the comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling the case insensitivity of table names when comparing them with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The failing test is checking for table existence using different cases of table names, and the function is not handling these cases properly, leading to assertion errors.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" highlights the problem and suggests a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, and it will pass the failing test. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post, making the function case insensitive when comparing table names.
