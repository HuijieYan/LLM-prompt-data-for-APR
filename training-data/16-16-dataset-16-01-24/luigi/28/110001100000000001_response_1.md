1. The buggy function is called table_exists and it checks if a table exists in a given database. It uses the run_hive_cmd function to run Hive commands and the partition_spec function to get the partition specification.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block where it calls run_hive_cmd with a formatted string.

3. The bug's cause is that the else block is not properly formatted and is missing the partition specification.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the formatting of the string in the else block to ensure it includes the partition specification.
   - Ensure that the run_hive_cmd function is called with the correct parameters.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```
