The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may be in a different case. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" highlights this problem and suggests that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making the comparison case insensitive.

This corrected code satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive".
