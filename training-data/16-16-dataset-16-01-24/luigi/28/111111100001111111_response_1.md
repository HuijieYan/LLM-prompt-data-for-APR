The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the function to fail when the table name is in a different case than expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering the case of the table name.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, and it will satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub by making the table existence check case insensitive.
