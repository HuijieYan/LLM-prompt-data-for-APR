The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name is in a different case than expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this change, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

This corrected code should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
