The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function is not converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the database, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.

The failing test is checking for the existence of a table using different cases, and the function is not handling this correctly, leading to assertion errors.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the database. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function will work correctly for tables with different cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, and it should pass the failing test cases. This also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post.
