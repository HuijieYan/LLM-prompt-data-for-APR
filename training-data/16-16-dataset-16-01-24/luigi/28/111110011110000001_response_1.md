The potential error location within the problematic function is in the else block of the table_exists function. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the command string when partition is not None.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly formatting the command string when partition is not None, leading to incorrect output and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to properly format the command string when partition is not None. We can use string formatting to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
