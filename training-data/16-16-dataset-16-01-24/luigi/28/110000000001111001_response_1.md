The potential error in the buggy function is that the condition for checking if the table exists is not being properly evaluated. In the first part of the function, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not checking if the table exists in the output of the `show tables` command. Instead, it is only checking if `stdout` is not empty. Similarly, in the second part of the function, the condition `if stdout` is only checking if `stdout` is not empty, but it should be checking if the partition exists.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions to properly check if the table or partition exists in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly check if the table or partition exists in the output and return the correct result.
