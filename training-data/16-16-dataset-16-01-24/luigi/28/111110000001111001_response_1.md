The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the Hive command when a partition is specified. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly in the else block when a partition is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the else block to correctly format the Hive command and call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
