1. The buggy function is a method called `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It checks if a table exists in a given database, and if a partition is specified, it also checks if the partition exists for the table.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if `stdout` is empty or not.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statement in the `table_exists` function is not handling the case where `stdout` is empty properly. It is also not handling the case where a partition is specified correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if `stdout` is empty using `if stdout.strip()` instead of just `stdout`.
   - Handle the case where a partition is specified by properly constructing the command to check for the partition.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```
