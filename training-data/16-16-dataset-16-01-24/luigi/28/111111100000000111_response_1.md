1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The comparison is case sensitive, leading to potential failures when the table names are in different cases.

3. The bug's cause is that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The related functions `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` are used within the `table_exists` function to execute Hive commands and handle partition specifications. The GitHub issue highlights the case sensitivity problem and suggests using `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.
   - Using the `lower()` method to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to make the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
