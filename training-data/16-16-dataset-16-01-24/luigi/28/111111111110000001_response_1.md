The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the `else` block where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called.

The bug's cause is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being called correctly in the `else` block of the `table_exists` function. This is causing the test to fail because the expected result is not being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly in both the `if` and `else` blocks of the `table_exists` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly in both the `if` and `else` blocks of the `table_exists` function. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
