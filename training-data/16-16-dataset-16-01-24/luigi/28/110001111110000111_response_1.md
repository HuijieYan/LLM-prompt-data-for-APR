The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. The failing test is `test_table_exists` in the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` file, and it is failing with the error message "AssertionError: False is not true".

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" also confirms that the function is not handling case insensitivity properly.

To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. The correction should involve converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table, and it should pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
