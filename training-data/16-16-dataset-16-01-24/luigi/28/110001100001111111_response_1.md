The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may be in a different case. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

The related GitHub issue suggests that the `table_exists` function should be made case insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout from Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout, making it case insensitive and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
