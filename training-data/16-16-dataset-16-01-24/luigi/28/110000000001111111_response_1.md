The issue with the buggy function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function should be case insensitive to avoid failing tests when the table names are in different cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, which does not consider case sensitivity.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which suggests checking stdout against table.lower() to avoid case issues.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout, making the comparison case insensitive.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
