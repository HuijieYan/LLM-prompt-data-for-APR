The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name's case does not match the case of the table name returned by Hive.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not converting the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout. This will make the function case-insensitive and ensure that it passes the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

This corrected code will pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
