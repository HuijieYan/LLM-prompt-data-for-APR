The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is not provided, and the `prune` method will not throw a `TypeError` when called. This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
