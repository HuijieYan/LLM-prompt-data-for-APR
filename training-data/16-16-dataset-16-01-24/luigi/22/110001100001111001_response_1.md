The issue with the buggy function is that it is missing an import statement for the `time` module. This is causing the `time.time()` function to fail, resulting in an incorrect value for `self.started`.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected values for the given input parameters.
