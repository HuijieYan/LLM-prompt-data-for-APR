1. The buggy function is an initialization function for a class, but it has a potential error in the way it initializes the 'last_active' attribute.

2. The potential error is in the way the 'last_active' attribute is initialized with a default value of None.

3. The bug's cause is that the 'last_active' attribute is not being properly initialized with the default value of None.

4. To fix the bug, we can explicitly check if the 'last_active' parameter is None and then set it to the current time if it is. We can also import the 'time' module to use the 'time.time()' function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we import the 'time' module and use the 'time.time()' function to initialize the 'last_active' and 'started' attributes. We also check if the 'last_active' parameter is None and set it to the current time if it is.
