1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is responsible for initializing the attributes of the Worker object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time module without importing it. The line "self.started = time.time()" will raise an error because the time module has not been imported.

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is not imported, so the code will raise an error when trying to access time.time().

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. This can be done by adding "import time" at the top of the file.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the time module imported, the code will now work as intended without raising any errors.
