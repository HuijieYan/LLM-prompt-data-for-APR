The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value. We can do this by setting `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid value.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
