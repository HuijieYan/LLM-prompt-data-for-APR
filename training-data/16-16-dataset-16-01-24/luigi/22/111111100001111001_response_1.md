The bug in the provided function is that it is missing an import statement for the `time` module, which is used to access the `time.time()` function. This causes the function to fail when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to add an import statement for the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly initialize the `started` variable with the current time using `time.time()`. This will ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
