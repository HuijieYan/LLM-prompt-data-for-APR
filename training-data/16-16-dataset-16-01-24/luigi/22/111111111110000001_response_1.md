The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. It is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled when it is set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time. This will ensure that the `last_active` parameter always has a valid value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it always has a valid value.

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
