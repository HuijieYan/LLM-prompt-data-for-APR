1. The buggy function is the constructor for a class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. It initializes various attributes of the class, such as worker_id, last_active, reference, started, tasks, and info.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time.time() function without importing the time module. This will result in a NameError when trying to access time.time().

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is not imported, so the time.time() function cannot be accessed within the __init__ function.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. This will allow the __init__ function to access the time.time() function without any issues.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# the corrected __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch (now with the time module imported)
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
