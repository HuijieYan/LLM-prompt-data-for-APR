1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The failing test is testing the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initially set to `None`) to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the initialization of `self.last_active` to `None`.

3. The bug's cause is that `self.last_active` is initially set to `None`, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Initialize `self.last_active` to a default value (e.g., 0) if it is not provided during initialization.
   - Modify the `prune` method to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None`.

5. Corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is set to 0 if it is not provided during initialization. This will prevent the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.
