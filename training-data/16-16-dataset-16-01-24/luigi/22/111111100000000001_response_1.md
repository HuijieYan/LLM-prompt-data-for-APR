1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is responsible for initializing the Worker object with the provided worker_id and last_active time. However, the function is missing the import statement for the time module, which is used to access the time.time() method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "self.started = time.time()", as the time module has not been imported.

3. The cause of the bug is that the time module has not been imported, so the time.time() method cannot be accessed within the __init__ method of the Worker class. This will result in a NameError when trying to access time.time().

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. This will allow the __init__ method of the Worker class to access the time.time() method without any issues.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Import the time module
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file, the corrected code ensures that the __init__ method of the Worker class can access the time.time() method without any issues.
