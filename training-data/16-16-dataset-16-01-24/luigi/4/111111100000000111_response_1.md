1. The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This function is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The function uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine if column names need to be included in the COPY command. The related functions `_credentials` and `copy_options` are also called within the `copy` function. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is set to None, causing a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to determine the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.

3. The bug's cause is that when `self.columns` is set to None, the `len` function is called on it, resulting in a TypeError. The GitHub issue also suggests that the bug was introduced in a specific pull request.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
   - Handling the case where `self.columns` is None separately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `if` statement checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
