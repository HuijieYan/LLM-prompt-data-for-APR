Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking the length of self.columns. If self.columns is None, then the code will raise a TypeError when trying to check the length of None.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the if statement checking the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns is not None. This causes a TypeError when self.columns is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.
2. Provide a default value for colnames if self.columns is empty.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if self.columns is not None before checking its length, the corrected code resolves the issue posted in the GitHub. This change ensures that the code does not raise a TypeError when self.columns is None.
