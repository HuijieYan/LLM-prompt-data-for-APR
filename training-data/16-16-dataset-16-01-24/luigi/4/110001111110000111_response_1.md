The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The error message indicates that the program is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which is not allowed.

The bug's cause is that the program is not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.
2. Using a default value for `self.columns` if it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
