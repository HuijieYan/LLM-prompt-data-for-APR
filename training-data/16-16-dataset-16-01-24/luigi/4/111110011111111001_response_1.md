The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it's not `None`, then we proceed with getting the column names and executing the `COPY` statement.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
