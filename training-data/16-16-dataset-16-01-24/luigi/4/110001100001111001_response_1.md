The potential error in the buggy function is the way the `copy_options` and `_credentials` functions are being called. The `copy_options` and `_credentials` functions are being called as if they are methods of the current class, but they are actually standalone functions. Additionally, the `copy_options` function should be called as a method of the current class.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `_credentials` function directly and call the `copy_options` function as a method of the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=_credentials(self),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will call the `_credentials` function correctly and call the `copy_options` function as a method of the current class. This should resolve the issues with the function and make it work as expected.
