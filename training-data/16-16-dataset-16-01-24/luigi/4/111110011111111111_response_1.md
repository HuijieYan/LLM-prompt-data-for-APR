The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The error message indicates that the program is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which is not allowed.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This is evident from the failing test, where `columns` is set to None and the program tries to get the length of it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and will not try to get the length of it. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
