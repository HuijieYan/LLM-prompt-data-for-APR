The bug in the provided code is in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error occurs because the code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None, leading to a TypeError when trying to get the length of None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, preventing the TypeError that was occurring.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
