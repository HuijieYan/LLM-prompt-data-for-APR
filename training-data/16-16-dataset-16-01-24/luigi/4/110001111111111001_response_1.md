The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to check the length of a NoneType object, which is causing a TypeError. This is happening because the `self.columns` attribute is None, and the function is trying to check its length.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `if` condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
