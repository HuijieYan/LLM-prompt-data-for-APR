The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `self.copy_options` without calling the `copy_options` function. This results in the `options` variable being assigned the string representation of the `copy_options` function, rather than the result of calling the function.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` function. The function should be called to obtain the actual options string, but instead, the function itself is being used as a string.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to obtain the options string and then use it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to obtain the options string

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the obtained options string
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is called to obtain the options string, which is then used in the `cursor.execute` statement. This ensures that the correct options are used for the copy operation.
