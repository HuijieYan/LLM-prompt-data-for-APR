The potential error in the buggy function is the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() method call. This is causing a syntax error in the SQL query.

The bug is caused by the missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() method call, which is resulting in a syntax error in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() method call.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() method call, the syntax error in the SQL query will be resolved.
