1. The buggy function is `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is called by the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `copy` method when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `copy` function is assuming that `self.columns` is not `None` without checking, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
   - Providing a default value for `self.columns` if it is `None`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, we also added parentheses to `self.copy_options` to call the method.
