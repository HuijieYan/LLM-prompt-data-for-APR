1. The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The failing test is testing this function by passing `None` as the `columns` parameter to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task and then calling the `run` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the `len` function is being called on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This is where the `TypeError` is being raised because `self.columns` is `None` and the `len` function cannot be called on a `NoneType` object.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` method is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This assumption is not being checked in the code, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function will pass the failing test.
