The bug in the provided function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This is in line with the failing test and error message, which indicates that the `columns` parameter is None and the TypeError is raised when trying to get the length of None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
