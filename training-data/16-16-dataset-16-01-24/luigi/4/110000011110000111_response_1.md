1. The buggy function is a method called `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The GitHub issue provides additional context and suggests a potential solution.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. The failing test is trying to run the `S3CopyToTable` task with `columns=None`, and the error message indicates that the length of a `NoneType` object cannot be obtained. The GitHub issue suggests a potential solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
   - Using a conditional statement to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub by addressing the potential solution suggested in the issue.
