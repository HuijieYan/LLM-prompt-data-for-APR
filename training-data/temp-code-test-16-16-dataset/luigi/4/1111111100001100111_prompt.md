Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, the actual input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The buggy class docs, 
   (c) The related functions, 
   (d) The actual input/output variable values, 
   (e) The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub

# Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
f, value: `'s3://bucket/key'`, type: `str`

self, value: `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(table=dummy_table, columns=null)`, type: `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`

cursor.execute, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor().execute' id='139954802731712'>`, type: `MagicMock`

cursor, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor()' id='139954802715280'>`, type: `MagicMock`

self.table, value: `'dummy_table'`, type: `str`

self.copy_options, value: `''`, type: `str`

### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
colnames, value: `''`, type: `str`



# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
The root cause seems to be https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338

A possible solution would be to change the line to

if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
unless I am missing some reason to explicitly ask only for len(self.columns).
```
