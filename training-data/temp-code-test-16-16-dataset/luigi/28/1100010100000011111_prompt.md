Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
database, 

table, 

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
stdout, expected value: `'OK'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 2
### Input parameter value and type
database, 

table, 

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
stdout, expected value: `'OK\nmytable'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 3
### Input parameter value and type
database, 

table, 

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
stdout, expected value: `'OK'`, type: `str`

## Expected case 4
### Input parameter value and type
database, 

table, 

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
stdout, expected value: `'OK\nmytable'`, type: `str`



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
