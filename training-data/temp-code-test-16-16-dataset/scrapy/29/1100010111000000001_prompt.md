Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/utils/request.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```

## A test function that the buggy function fails
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/test_utils_request.py

    def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
        # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
        request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
        request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```
