from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():





    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()

# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
The markers are not hollow when I use ax.scatter() and set markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. My usage is wrong?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a costomed markers.MarkerStyle and set the paramter fillstyle='none'. But I don't get what I want.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np
xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
