Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
mode, 

x, 

data_format, 

x.ndim, 

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
x, expected value: `array([[[[ 1.91028712e+01,  8.68369035e+01,  1.17983406e+02] ... [-2.92360025e+01,  9.51717684e+01,  6.02940276e+01]]]])`, shape: `(2, 10, 10, 3)`, type: `ndarray`

mean, expected value: `[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]`, type: `list`



1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the the expected input/output variable information.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The expected input/output variable values

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided
