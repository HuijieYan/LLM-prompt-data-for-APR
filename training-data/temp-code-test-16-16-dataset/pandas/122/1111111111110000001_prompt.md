Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, test code, corresponding error message.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The buggy class docs, 
   (c) The related functions, 
   (d) The failing test, 
   (e) The corresponding error message

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test
