4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```




## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
As per comment by @jacobaustin123:
import pandas as pd
idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([pd.PeriodIndex([pd.Period("2019Q1"), pd.Period("2019Q2")], name='b')])
idx2 = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])
all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels) # raises an error

Problem description
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex er dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Expected Output
The above should return True.
```
