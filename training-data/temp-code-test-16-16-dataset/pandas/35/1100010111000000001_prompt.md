Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

## A test function that the buggy function fails
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py

def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```
