Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import Timedelta, Timestamp, lib, ops as libops
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCExtensionArray, ABCIndexClass, ABCSeries, ABCTimedeltaArray, ABCTimedeltaIndex
