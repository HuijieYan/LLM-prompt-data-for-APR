Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, the actual input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The failing test, 
   (c) The actual input/output variable values, 
   (d) The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test, 
   (b) successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub



## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

## A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tornado/test/ioloop_test.py

    def test_force_current(self):
        self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
        with self.assertRaises(RuntimeError):
            # A second make_current=True construction cannot succeed.
            IOLoop(make_current=True)
        # current() was not affected by the failed construction.
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
```




## Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
make_current, value: `True`, type: `bool`



## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
line 252, IOLoop.current(instance=False) is Noneã€‚why then raise "already exists"?
```
