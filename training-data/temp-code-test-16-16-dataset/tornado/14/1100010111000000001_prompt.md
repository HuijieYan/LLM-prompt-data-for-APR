Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The failing test

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test



## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

## A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tornado/test/ioloop_test.py

    def test_force_current(self):
        self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
        with self.assertRaises(RuntimeError):
            # A second make_current=True construction cannot succeed.
            IOLoop(make_current=True)
        # current() was not affected by the failed construction.
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
```
