Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    
```

# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tornado/test/ioloop_test.py

    def test_force_current(self):
        self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
        with self.assertRaises(RuntimeError):
            # A second make_current=True construction cannot succeed.
            IOLoop(make_current=True)
        # current() was not affected by the failed construction.
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
```




1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the related functions, test code, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The related functions
   (c). The failing test

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
