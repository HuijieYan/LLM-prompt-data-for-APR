Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 2
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 3
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 4
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '--set-upstream', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push --set-upstream origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

## Case 5
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '--quiet']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push --quiet, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Fix suggestions for git push -u origin
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Resolves #558
```

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```
