Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, the actual input/output variable information, the github issue.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The failing test, 
   (c) The actual input/output variable values, 
   (d) The GitHub Issue information

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test, 
   (b) successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub



Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py

def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```




# Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script, value: `'git'`, type: `str`

command, value: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=
usage: git stash list [<options>]
   or: git stash show [<stash>]
   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `str`

### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
splited_script, value: `['git']`, type: `list`



# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
thefuck master ðŸ”§  git
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]

   checkout   Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
   grep       Print lines matching a pattern
   init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
   log        Show commit logs
   merge      Join two or more development histories together
   mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
   rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
   reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index
   show       Show various types of objects
   status     Show the working tree status
