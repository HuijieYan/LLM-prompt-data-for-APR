```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

## A test function that the buggy function fails
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py

def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
