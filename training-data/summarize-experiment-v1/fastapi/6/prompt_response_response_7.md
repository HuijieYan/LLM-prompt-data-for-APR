The actual issue provided doesn't seem to be related to the code you've shared. However, based on the code provided, the potential bug in the `request_body_to_args` function appears to be with the handling of the received_body when it is a sequence and checking for the required fields and their values.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to appropriately handle the sequence shapes (e.g., lists, etc.) in the received_body and ensure that the required fields are properly checked and validated.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function could be updated as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, Sequence):
                    value = list(value)  # Convert sequence values to list
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This fixed function makes sure to properly handle cases where the received_body is a sequence and appropriately checks and validates the required fields.

It's important to mention that additional context, such as error messages, specific use case, and test code, would be needed to provide a more precise fix for the issue.

Please provide the specific error message or more details if you need further assistance.
