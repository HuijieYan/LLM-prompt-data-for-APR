The provided code has the potential to create a confusion between the variables `field` and `field_info` as they are used in nested scopes within the same block of the buggy function. This could lead to incorrect assignments and comparisons.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the confusion between the two variables, `field` and `field_info`. The `field` variable is used within the loop for iteration, while the `field_info` variable is introduced inside the loop as well but not used consistently. There seems to be a mix-up between these two variables, leading to potential errors in accessing and handling the required parameters.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the variables `field` and `field_info` are used correctly and consistently throughout the loop. In addition, there seems to be an issue with how the `required_params` are processed, possibly leading to incorrect extraction of values from the `received_body`.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if value is None or (isinstance(field, params.Form) and value == "") \
               or (isinstance(field, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
                
            if isinstance(field, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(sub_value, UploadFile) for sub_value in value):
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*[sub_value.read() for sub_value in value])
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues by ensuring consistent usage of the `field` and `field_info` variables and correctly extracting and validating the required parameters from the `received_body`.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
