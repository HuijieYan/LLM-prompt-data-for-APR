The bug in the obscure_transform function lies in the enumeration of the reversed string. The current implementation reverses the input string and then loops through the characters, converting every other character to uppercase or lowercase based on its position in the reversed string. However, this results in an incorrect transformation.

To fix this bug, we need to reverse the input string first and then apply the transformation based on the original character positions. We can achieve this by reversing the input string outside the for loop and then iterating through the characters using the original index positions.

Here's the corrected implementation of the obscure_transform function:

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    reversed_text = text[::-1]  # Reverse the input string
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(text):  # Iterate through the characters using original index positions
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += reversed_text[i].upper()  # Use the original index to access characters in reversed string
        else:
            result += reversed_text[i].lower()
    return result
```

With this correction, the function should produce the correct transformation based on the original index positions, resulting in the expected output for the given test cases.
