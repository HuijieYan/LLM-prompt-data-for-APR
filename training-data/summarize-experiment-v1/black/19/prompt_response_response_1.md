The provided source code is not the buggy function mentioned in the initial prompt, so I will provide a fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as outlined in the prompt.

## Fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function

The potential error location in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be in the logic for calculating the `newlines` and `before` values based on the conditions. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

The bug's cause appears to be a potential incorrect calculation of the `newlines` and `before` values based on the conditions and the depth of the current line.

To fix the bug, consider revising the logic for determining the `newlines` and `before` values based on the conditions specific to inserting empty lines before the current line.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining the `newlines` and `before` values has been revised based on the identified potential errors. The adjustments in the conditions and calculations aim to ensure the correct handling of empty lines based on the specified conditions provided in the original code.
