The provided source code is not the buggy function mentioned in the initial prompt, so I will provide a fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as outlined in the prompt.

## Fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function

Looking at the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it appears to manage and track empty lines based on certain conditions within the code. The related functions, such as `is_import`, `is_decorator`, etc., indicate different conditions or checks that could potentially impact the behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Without the specific error message, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact issue, but the function appears to handle various conditions related to indentation, decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding in the code. It's likely that the bug may be related to how specific cases are being handled within the function.

Based on the information provided, a potential approach for fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could involve carefully reviewing each conditional branch and ensuring that the logic aligns with the intended behavior for managing empty lines. It may also involve considering edge cases and boundary conditions for the function's behavior and interactions with related functions.

## Revised `_maybe_empty_lines` Function

Here's a revised version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that incorporates potential fixes based on the provided information:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or (depth == self.previous_line.depth and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import):
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this revised version, I've made adjustments to the conditional branches, considering the interactions with related functions and the expected behavior described in the prompt.

This revised version aims to ensure that the function aligns with the intended handling of conditions related to indentation, decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding in the code.

Please note that without the specific error message or additional context, the revised function may need further adjustment based on the actual issue encountered. If possible, providing the specific error message would enable a more targeted and accurate fix for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
