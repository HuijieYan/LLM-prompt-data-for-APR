Related functions in the same file and not in the same class as the buggy function include:

- `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None`
- `is_decorator(self) -> bool`
- `is_import(self) -> bool`
- `is_class(self) -> bool`
- `is_def(self) -> bool`
- `is_flow_control(self) -> bool`
- `is_yield(self) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=True) -> None`

These functions likely have interactions with the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The buggy function appears to track and manage empty lines based on certain conditions within the code. The related functions, such as `is_import`, `is_decorator`, etc., seem to indicate different conditions or checks that could potentially impact the behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It is important to understand these related functions and their roles in the codebase to diagnose the issue with the buggy function.
