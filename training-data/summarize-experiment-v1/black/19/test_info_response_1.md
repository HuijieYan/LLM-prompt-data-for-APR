Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for the specific line or code where the error occurred. This will help identify the source of the issue and any relevant stack frames or messages.

Next, consider the context of the error. Is it related to a command line input, test code, or a specific function in the source code? Understanding the context can help pinpoint the source of the problem.

Once the source of the error is identified, simplify the original error message by removing any extraneous information and focusing on the key details. This can help clarify the issue and make it easier to understand and troubleshoot.

If you can provide the specific error message, I'd be happy to help analyze it further and provide more specific guidance.
