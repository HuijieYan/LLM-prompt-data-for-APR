Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific issue. However, in general, when dealing with error messages on the command line, it is important to look for any specific line numbers or function names mentioned in the error message. This can help identify where the issue is occurring in the code.

Additionally, examining the test code and the source code where the error occurs can provide valuable context for understanding the root cause of the issue.

Once the fault location is identified, it can be helpful to simplify the original error message by removing any irrelevant or overly technical information and focusing on the specific action or input that triggered the error. This can make it easier to communicate the issue to others and to troubleshoot the problem.
