## Bug Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix string partially based on the specified column and return the consumed part along with the leftover. The function works with whitespaces, tabs, and newlines to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

The potential error location is in the `wait_for_nl` condition block where it checks the `char` to be a newline (`'\n'`) and updates the `current_line` accordingly. However, it fails to reset `current_line` and `current_column` when the `if char == '\n':` condition is not met, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix string.

The buggy function throws an error when it fails to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters based on the provided column parameter. This error is likely caused by incorrect handling of the prefix string when processing whitespace, tabs, and newlines. This may result in the consumption of the prefix string in a way that does not align with the specified column parameter, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

The failing test and error message are not provided, making it difficult to analyze the specific issue. It is important to have access to the exact error message and corresponding test code to understand the root cause of the problem.

The expected input/output variable values are not available, making it challenging to assess the exact function behavior and potential discrepancies between expected and actual outputs.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `partially_consume_prefix` function:
1. Update the processing logic to correctly handle whitespace, tabs, and newlines based on the specified column parameter.
2. Reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when the `if char == '\n':` condition is not met to ensure proper handling of the prefix string.

Here is the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
                    current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the `partially_consume_prefix` function should now process the prefix string correctly based on the specified column parameter, leading to the expected output. Additional testing may be required to verify the correctness of the fix.

This resolution addresses the GitHub issue related to the incorrect tabulated comments indentation after a dedent, as the corrected `partially_consume_prefix` function should handle whitespaces, tabs, and newlines more accurately.
