## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_10/blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class method `_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column)`: This function appears to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided column parameter. It seems to handle whitespace, tabs, and newlines to determine when to stop consuming the prefix and return the consumed part along with the leftover.

There are no explicit related functions mentioned within the code, but the function seems to be handling text manipulation and parsing based on the input prefix string and the specified column. The function does not seem to interact directly with other classes or functions in the given context.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific issue. However, in general, when dealing with error messages on the command line, it is important to look for any specific line numbers or function names mentioned in the error message. This can help identify where the issue is occurring in the code.

Additionally, examining the test code and the source code where the error occurs can provide valuable context for understanding the root cause of the issue.

Once the fault location is identified, it can be helpful to simplify the original error message by removing any irrelevant or overly technical information and focusing on the specific action or input that triggered the error. This can make it easier to communicate the issue to others and to troubleshoot the problem.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug in the obscure_transform function lies in the enumeration of the reversed string. The current implementation reverses the input string and then loops through it while enumerating using the reversed() function. This causes the even and odd positions to be swapped due to the reversing. To fix this bug, we need to reverse the string after the enumeration to ensure that the correct transformation is applied.

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(text):  # loop through the original string
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result[::-1]  # reverse the transformed string before returning
``` 

With this modification, the function should now correctly transform the input string according to the specified rules.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

# The fixed source code 
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 1: 
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
