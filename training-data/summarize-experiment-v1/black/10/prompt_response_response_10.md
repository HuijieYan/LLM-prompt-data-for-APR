The original function is from the file `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_10/blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. It seems to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided column parameter.

The main issue with the function is that it may not correctly handle cases with the "wait_for_nl" step when handling whitespace, tabs, and newlines in the prefix string. This may lead to incorrect consumption of the prefix and returning the remaining part of it.

To fix the bug, one can revise the logic within the conditional blocks and consider the handling of the "wait_for_nl" flag to ensure that the prefix is consumed correctly based on the provided column value.

A potential fix for the bug in `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]  # Fix the return statement

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)  # Fix line appending
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Reset current_line if indentation is finished
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line  # Fix the return statement
```
By applying this revised logic, the function should now correctly handle the consumption of the prefix based on the specified column parameter and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix.

This updated function should address the potential issue of incorrect consumption and handling of newlines, indentation, and whitespace in the prefix string.
