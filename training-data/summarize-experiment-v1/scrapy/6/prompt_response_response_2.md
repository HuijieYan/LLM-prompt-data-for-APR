The `convert_image` function is responsible for performing different operations on an image based on its format and mode, including converting the image to RGB if it is not already in that format, resizing the image if a size is provided, and then saving the image in JPEG format.

The potential error location in the `convert_image` function is the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`, where the function is trying to save the image in JPEG format and return the modified image and a BytesIO object.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of the image format and mode, as well as the resizing process. The failing test could provide more insight into the specific error message or behavior encountered.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` can correctly save the image in JPEG format and handle the conversion process effectively. Additionally, the resizing process should be reviewed to ensure it is functioning as intended.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))  # Updated paste method
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Updated save method
    return image, buf
```

With these updates, the `convert_image` function should effectively handle the image format, mode, resizing, and saving processes, producing the expected output.
