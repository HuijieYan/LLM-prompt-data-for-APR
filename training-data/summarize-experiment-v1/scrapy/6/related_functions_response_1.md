Class docstring: This class is an abstract pipeline that implements the logic for image thumbnail generation.

`def convert_image(self, image, size=None)`: This function takes an image object and an optional size parameter. It performs different operations on the image based on its format and mode, including converting the image to RGB if it is not already in that format, resizing the image if a size is provided, and then saving the image in JPEG format.

`Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))`: This line of code creates a new RGBA image with a white background.

`background.paste(image, image)`: This line pastes the original image onto the white background.

`image.convert('RGB')`: This line converts the image to RGB format.

`image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`: This line saves the image in JPEG format and returns the modified image and a BytesIO object.

Overall, the `convert_image` function seems to handle the conversion and resizing of images, including the handling of different image formats and modes. The interaction with other functions or classes is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.
