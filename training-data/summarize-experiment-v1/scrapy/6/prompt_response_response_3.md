The buggy function seems to have a potential error location where it checks the input image's format and mode and performs different operations based on the conditions. The bug may be causing the function to not correctly handle the specific conditions for the image format and mode, leading to unexpected behavior.

The potential bugs causing the issue could be:
1. Not handling the format and mode of the image correctly, leading to incorrect operations being performed on the image.
2. Incorrect handling of the size parameter for image resizing, leading to unexpected results when resizing the image.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional statements for image format and mode to ensure they are correctly identifying the conditions and applying the appropriate operations.
2. Check the handling of the size parameter to ensure it is correctly used for resizing the image.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
With this fix, the function should correctly handle the image format, mode, and size parameters, and produce the expected output.
