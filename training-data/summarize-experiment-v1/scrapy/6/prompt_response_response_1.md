The buggy function seems to have a potential error location where it checks the input image's format and mode and performs different operations based on the conditions. The bug may be caused by incorrectly handling the image format and mode, leading to unexpected output.

The failing test code is not provided, so we don't have information about the corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable values, and the expected input/output variable values.

However, based on the provided function and class docs, it seems that the bug is in handling the image format and mode conditions. The code snippet shows that the function first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' and then creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image onto it. It then converts the image to RGB format. However, there might be potential issues with the conditional checks and the operations being performed on the image.

To fix the potential bug, we can modify the conditional checks and image operations to ensure that the image format and mode are handled correctly. We can also consider providing default values for the size parameter to avoid potential issues with the resizing operation.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Changed 'RGBA' to 'RGB'
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Fixed the paste operation
        image = background  # Removed the redundant conversion
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code modifies the conditional checks and image operations to address any potential issues with handling the image format and mode. It also ensures that the image resizing operation is handled appropriately.
