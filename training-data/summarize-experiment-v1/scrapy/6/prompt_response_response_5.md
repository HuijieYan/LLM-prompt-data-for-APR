The `convert_image` function is responsible for performing different operations on an image based on its format and mode, including converting the image to RGB if it is not already in that format, resizing the image if a size is provided, and then saving the image in JPEG format.

The potential error location in the `convert_image` function is the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`, where the function is trying to save the image in JPEG format and return the modified image and a BytesIO object.

The bug appears to be with the incorrect handling of the image format and mode, as well as the usage of the `image.save` method. The function is designed to handle different conditions based on the image format and mode, but it may not be correctly converting the image or saving it in the specified format.

A potential approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic for handling different image formats and modes, ensuring that the image is correctly converted and saved in the specified format. It may require modifying the conditional statements for handling different image properties.

Here's a corrected version of the `convert_image` function with updated logic to handle the format and mode of the image, as well as the saving process:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the `convert_image` function is updated to handle different image formats and modes more effectively, and the image saving process is corrected to specify the JPEG format. This corrected version should address the buggy behavior and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
