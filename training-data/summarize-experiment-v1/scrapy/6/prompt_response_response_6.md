The buggy function seems to have a potential error location where it checks the input image's format and mode and performs different operations based on the conditions. The bug may be caused by incorrectly handling the image format and mode, leading to unexpected output.

The failing test code is a Java code that tries to access an index of an array that does not exist, resulting in the error message "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10."

The expected input is an image object, and an optional size parameter, while the expected output is the modified image and a BytesIO object.

To fix the bug in the given function, it's important to ensure that the image format and mode are handled correctly and that the operations are performed based on the correct conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255)) 
        background.paste(image, (0,0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function should now handle the image format and mode correctly and produce the expected output.
