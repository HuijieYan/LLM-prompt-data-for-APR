The `convert_image` function is responsible for performing different operations on an image based on its format and mode, including converting the image to RGB if it is not already in that format, resizing the image if a size is provided, and then saving the image in JPEG format.

The potential error location in the `convert_image` function is the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`, where the function is trying to save the image in JPEG format, but it should be returning the BytesIO object instead.

The bug's cause is that the function is returning both the modified image and the BytesIO object, but it should only be returning the BytesIO object as the final output.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Modify the `convert_image` function to only return the BytesIO object instead of both the modified image and the BytesIO object.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return buf
```
In the corrected code, the `convert_image` function now only returns the `buf` (BytesIO) object, which is the expected output according to the function's purpose.
