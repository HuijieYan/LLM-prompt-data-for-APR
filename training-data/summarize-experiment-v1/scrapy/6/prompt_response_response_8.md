The buggy function seems to have a potential error location where it checks the input image's format and mode and performs different operations based on the conditions. The bug may be caused by incorrectly handling the image format and mode, leading to unexpected output.

The failing test code is a Java code that tries to access an index of an array that does not exist, resulting in the error message "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10."

The expected input is an image object, and an optional size parameter, and the output is the modified image and a BytesIO object.

To fix the bug, we can add proper checks for the image format and mode and handle each case separately to ensure that the operations are performed correctly. Additionally, we should handle the size parameter properly to ensure that the image is resized as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function should correctly handle different image formats and modes and perform the resizing operation as expected.
