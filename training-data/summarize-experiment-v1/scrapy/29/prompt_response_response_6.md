The provided source code is for the `request_httprepr` function and it is used to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. The function parses the request, creates the path, and appends the method, host, headers, and body to the raw HTTP representation.

Potential error location:
The potential error in the function could be the concatenation of the request body without verifying its existence or checking its type.

Bug cause:
The bug may be caused by the `request.body` being concatenated with the raw HTTP representation without proper validation. If the `request.body` is not a byte string, it can cause the concatenation to fail.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `request.body` exists and if it is of type byte string before concatenating.
2. Convert `request.body` to a byte string if it is not already in that format.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        if isinstance(request.body, str):
            s += to_bytes(request.body)
        else:
            s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to verify if `request.body` exists and if it is of type byte string. If it is not a byte string, it is converted to a byte string before concatenating with the raw HTTP representation.

This updated code ensures that the raw HTTP representation is constructed correctly and addresses the potential bug in the original function.
