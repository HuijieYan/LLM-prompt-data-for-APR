Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_bytes() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body, to_native_str)
    return s
```

The buggy function was attempting to access the 'parsed.path' attribute directly, which is not correct. Instead, it should access the 'parsed.path' through the 'parsed' object. Similarly, for reading the 'hostname' attribute, 'to_bytes()' should be used to convert the 'hostname' into bytes.

Additionally, when appending the 'headers' to the byte string 's', the 'to_string()' method should be replaced with 'to_bytes()' as well.

Finally, the 'request.body' should be converted to bytes using 'to_bytes()' and 'to_native_str' before appending it to the byte string 's'.
