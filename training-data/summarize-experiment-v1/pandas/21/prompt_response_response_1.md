The issue related to the `def _get_with(self, key)` function is part of the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for handling various types of keys and performing different operations based on the type of the key. The issue occurs when using a list indexer, as it is treated differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior and resulting in a `KeyError`.

To address this issue, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers, ensuring that it behaves as expected and does not raise errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `def _get_with(self, key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the `def _get_with(self, key)` function should handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the issue and ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
