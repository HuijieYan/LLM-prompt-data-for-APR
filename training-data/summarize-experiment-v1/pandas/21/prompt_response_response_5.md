The issue related to the `def _get_with(self, key)` function is part of the `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]` GitHub issue. The function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers.

Based on the error message and the behavior described in the GitHub issue, it seems that there might be an inconsistency in handling the indexers, particularly with lists, causing a KeyError to be raised for the list case. This inconsistency might be due to different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers, such as list indexers and array-like indexers, when indexing a `Series`. It should handle indexers in a uniform way to avoid inconsistencies and unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code ensures consistent handling of key types and avoids the unexpected KeyError raised for list indexers. It also makes use of the `ensure_index` function to ensure a uniform treatment of indexers. This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.

Additionally, error handling for different types of indexers has been improved based on the observed behavior.

It is important to note that the actual changes made to the code depend on the specific behavior expected and the requirements of the `Series` indexing API. Therefore, further discussion and review of the changes might be necessary to ensure they align with the intended functionality.
