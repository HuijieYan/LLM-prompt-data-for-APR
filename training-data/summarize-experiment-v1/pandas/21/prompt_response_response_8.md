The issue related to the `def _get_with(self, key)` function is part of the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for handling various types of keys and performing different operations based on the type of the key. The issue occurs when using a list as the key for indexing a `Series`, which leads to inconsistent behavior.

The error message and the test code provided are not directly related to the `def _get_with(self, key)` function. However, it seems that the issue described in the GitHub post is related to the inconsistent behavior when using a list as the key for indexing a `Series`.

To fix the issue, the relevant approach would be to ensure consistent behavior when using different types of indexers for a `Series`. This involves handling the list indexer case similar to other indexers to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `def _get_with(self, key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexer case similar to other indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Remaining logic... (omitted for brevity)
```

By applying this fix, the function should now handle the list indexer case similar to other indexers, resolving the inconsistency issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
