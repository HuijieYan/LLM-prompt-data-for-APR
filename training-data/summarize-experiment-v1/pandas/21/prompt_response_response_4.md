The function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of keys and perform different operations based on the type of the key. The bug in the function is likely causing unexpected behaviors when dealing with different key types.

The bug's cause:
The `if` conditions within the `_get_with` function and the logic for handling the different key types may not be correctly identifying and handling the types of keys passed to the function.

The failing test code is not directly related to the `_get_with` function, so it does not provide relevant information about the specific bug being handled.

The program is expecting the function to correctly handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate operations based on the key type.

A potential approach for fixing the bug could be to refactor the `_get_with` function to more accurately identify and handle different types of keys. The conditionals and logic for these keys should have clear and well-defined behaviors to ensure proper handling.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function that addresses potential issues in key handling:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function aims to accurately handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate operations. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the program passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
