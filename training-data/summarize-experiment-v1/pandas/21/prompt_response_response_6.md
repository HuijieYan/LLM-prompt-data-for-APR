The provided Python function has an issue. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised function addresses the bug where different types of keys were not being handled consistently. In the fixed function, both numpy arrays and lists are treated similarly, and the correct operations are performed based on the type of the key.
