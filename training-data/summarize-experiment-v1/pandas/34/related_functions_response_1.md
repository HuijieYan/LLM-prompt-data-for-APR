Class docstring: The class TimeGrouper serves as a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, with parameters for frequency, closed end of interval, label, and convention.

`_get_time_bins(self, ax)` function: This function within the TimeGrouper class takes an ax parameter and performs various operations on it to generate time bins.

`_get_timestamp_range_edges(first, last, offset, closed='left', base=0)`: A private function that is used within the `_get_time_bins` function to calculate the range edges based on the input parameters.

`ax(self)`: Another function in the same file, likely unrelated, as it has a different signature compared to the `_get_time_bins` function.

`_adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)`: A method within the TimeGrouper class that is called by the `_get_time_bins` method to adjust bin edges.

Understanding the interactions between the `_get_time_bins` function, private functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`, and the class `TimeGrouper` will help in diagnosing the error within the `_get_time_bins` function.
