The issue mentioned on GitHub seems to be related to the `groupby` function not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error occurs specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time becomes ambiguous due to the clock change.

Based on the issue description, it seems that the call to `groupby` should return three groups (one for each day - 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (the first midnight before the clock change) and should contain the 25 hourly data points for that day.

The issue also mentions that an earlier issue (#23742) was fixed in version 0.24, but the current issue still persists.

Potential Bug Location: 
The potential bug within the `_get_time_bins` function could be related to the date range creation and handle of ambiguous time. Specifically, the use of `ambiguous="infer"` and `nonexistent="shift_forward"` might not be handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Review the handling of ambiguous times and non-existent times in the `date_range` function.
2. Check if there are any discrepancies in how the `TimeGrouper` class handles ambiguous timestamps.
3. Consider updating the handling of ambiguous timestamps to correctly assign them to the appropriate group.

Here's the updated `_get_time_bins` function to address the potential bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Avoid ambiguous and nonexistent times, enforce handling of the clock-change day in Cuba
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous times to NaT to avoid AmbiguousTimeError
        nonexistent="shift_forward",  # Handle non-existent times
        normalize=True  # Normalize the range to avoid ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This fix addresses the potential bug by setting ambiguous times to `NaT` to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` and correctly handling non-existent times on the clock-change day in Cuba. Make sure to test this fix with the specific test case that resulted in the `AmbiguousTimeError` to confirm that the issue has been resolved.
