The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be part of the TimeGrouper class, which is responsible for custom time-interval grouping in pandas. This function takes an `ax` parameter, which is expected to be a DatetimeIndex. It performs various operations on the input index to generate time bins.

The error seems to be occurring due to a potential issue with the calculation of bin edges, specifically related to nanosecond precision and the closed end of the intervals.

The provided test case and error message are related to a different bug (AmbiguousTimeError in groupby with daily frequency on clock change day in Cuba), and not directly related to the provided `_get_time_bins` function.

Given the absence of specific error details related to the `_get_time_bins` function, it's challenging to suggest an approach for fixing the bug.

In the absence of specific error details and the corresponding test case, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. However, to address potential issues with nanosecond precision and bin edge calculation, we can consider the use of the `normalize` parameter in the `date_range` function to align the bin edges more accurately. Additionally, ensuring proper handling of NaN values, if present, in the input index can also address potential irregularities in the resulting bins.

Here's an updated version of the `_get_time_bins` function with adjustments for potential nanosecond precision and NaN handling issues:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use normalize parameter to align bin edges accurately
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Adjust for nanosecond precision
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This updated version of the `_get_time_bins` function aims to address potential nanosecond precision and NaN handling issues that might contribute to errors in the function. However, without specific error details and a corresponding failing test case, it's challenging to ensure that this fix fully addresses the observed bug.
