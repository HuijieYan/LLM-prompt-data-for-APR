Without the error message, test code, and buggy source code, I cannot provide a specific analysis or simplify the original error message. However, in general, when analyzing an error message on the command line, it's important to look for specific information about the error, such as the line number and file where the error occurred, as well as any relevant stack traces. The test code and buggy source code will also be crucial for identifying the fault location and understanding the context of the error.

Once the relevant information is provided, I can help with analyzing the error message and simplifying it as needed.
