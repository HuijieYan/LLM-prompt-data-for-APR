## Bug Cause and Fixes

The buggy `astype_nansafe` function contains a lot of logic for handling different types of data and performing type casting, which makes it prone to errors.

In this case, the bug appears to be related to the conditional logic around handling timedelta64 data. When `dtype` is not in the list `[_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]`, the function attempts to handle frequency conversions. However, if the use case does not align with this logic, it can lead to a TypeError when trying to perform frequency conversions.

To fix this bug:
1. Identify the cases where frequency conversions are needed and handle them appropriately.
2. Add conditional checks to handle the specific use case, ensuring that types are handled properly without attempting unnecessary frequency conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function, addressing the identified bug:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    elif is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.view(dtype)

        # Allow frequency conversions
        if dtype.kind == "M":
            return arr.astype(dtype)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a datetimelike from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.view(dtype)

        if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:
            if dtype.kind == "m":
                mask = isna(arr)
                result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
                result[mask] = np.nan
                return result
        elif dtype == _TD_DTYPE:
            return arr.astype(_TD_DTYPE, copy=copy)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    # Rest of the conditions remain unchanged
    ...
```

In this corrected code, I've adjusted the conditional logic for handling timedelta64 data to address potential unexpected frequency conversions that may cause a TypeError.

By introducing appropriate conditional checks, the corrected code should handle the use cases for different data types more robustly and avoid the TypeError caused by unexpected frequency conversions.

Note: The actual conditions and handling of frequency conversions may need further adjustments based on specific use cases, but the provided change serves as a starting point for addressing the identified bug.
