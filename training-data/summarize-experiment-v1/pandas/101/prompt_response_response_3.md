The bug identified is related to casting categorical null values to integer, which results in unexpected behavior. The provided code is not directly related to the given bug; however, we can refactor the code and discuss potential fixes.

The source code provided seems to be a simple function `f(x)` that takes an input `x`, checks if `x` is greater than 1, and assigns a value to `y` based on that condition. The issue mentioned, on the other hand, is about the improper conversion of categorical null values to integers.

The issue is associated with casting categorical null values to integer, which results in unexpected behavior. The code example provided in the issue demonstrates this problem, where converting categorical series back to an integer column results in NaN being converted to an unexpected negative integer value.

Given the issue description, it is important to modify the logic related to the conversion of categorical null values to integers. This can potentially involve updating the logic for type conversion and handling specific edge cases for categorical data, particularly when it contains null values.

A potential fix could involve adding a check to handle the conversion of null values explicitly and ensure that the expected output is NaN or a nullable integer value.

Here's a potential fix for the issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    ...
    <existing logic for type conversion>
    ...
    
    # Handle specific logic for converting categorical data to int
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr) and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        if isna(arr).any():
            return arr.astype('Int64')  # Convert null values to nullable Int64
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    return arr  # Return the input array if no specific logic is triggered
```

By adding specific logic to handle the conversion of categorical data to integer type, we can address the issue and ensure that the output adheres to the expected behavior.

It is important to note that the provided code fix is an example of how the logic inside the `astype_nansafe` function could be updated to handle categorical to integer conversion properly. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and edge cases.

This proposed solution addresses the categorical to integer conversion issue described in the GitHub issue. It ensures that null values are handled appropriately during the type conversion process, resulting in the expected output.
