`astype_nansafe()` function: This function seems to be used for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It takes parameters `arr`, `dtype`, `copy`, and `skipna`. It contains a detailed logic for handling different data types, including converting to string, handling datetime and timedelta data, and handling object data types as well. It also has error handling for certain scenarios, such as when the dtype of a datetime or timedelta does not have a unit.

`astype_nansafe()` function call: The buggy function with the same name is likely calling this function for type conversion. It is possible that the bug lies in how this function is being called or how its return value is being used.
