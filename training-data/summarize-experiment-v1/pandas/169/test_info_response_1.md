Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for the specific line or code where the error occurred. This will help identify the source of the issue and any relevant stack frames or messages.

Next, review the test code that led to the error. Check for any inputs or conditions that could have caused the error to occur.

Once the error location and test code have been identified, review the buggy source code to understand the context of the error. Look for any potential issues with variable assignments, function calls, or logic that could have led to the error.

Finally, simplify the original error message by summarizing the key details, such as the location of the error, the specific error type, and any relevant context from the test or source code.

If you have a specific error message, feel free to share it and I can help analyze it in more detail.
