Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue and to identify the fault location and related stack frames. However, typically an error message on the command line will provide information about the nature of the error, the file and line number where the error occurred, and possibly a brief description of the error.

To simplify the original error message, first diagnose the error by looking at the command line error message, then locate the test code and buggy source code that caused the error. This will provide the necessary context to simplify the error message and identify the specific fault location and related stack frames.
