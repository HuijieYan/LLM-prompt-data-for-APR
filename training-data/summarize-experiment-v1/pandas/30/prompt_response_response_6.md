The function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to handle different data types and formats including handling empty data, converting object types to integer, checking for out of range numbers, and attempting conversion to date using different date units. However, the potential error location in this function could be where the new_data is assigned the value of `data.astype("int64")`. This might not handle cases where `data` cannot be converted to "int64" which would result in the function throwing an error.

The cause of the bug could be due to improper error handling or a lack of validation for certain data types during the conversion process. This could trigger errors when certain input data cannot be successfully converted using the provided logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper error handling and validation during the data conversion steps, and handle cases where the input data cannot be successfully converted.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            # ignore numbers that are out of range
            if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    isna(new_data._values)
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                    | (new_data._values == iNaT)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should handle various input data types and formats correctly and perform the date conversion process as intended. This should address the issue posted in GitHub.

This corrected code provides appropriate error handling and validation for the data conversion process, ensuring that the function can handle various input formats and types without throwing errors.
