The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to handling different date formats and units. The function appears to be aimed at converting an ndarray-like data input into a date column by coercing object types to integer, handling out of range numbers, and attempting conversion to date using different date units.

The potential error location within the function could be the section where it checks for `np.number` data type and then tries to find values that are not in range (`in_range`). There might be an issue with this logic that causes incorrect parsing and handling of different data types.

The bug's cause may originate from the way the function handles different data types and checks for 'in_range' values. It seems that the function is encountering issues in correctly determining and converting the data types to date columns.

To fix the bug, it is advisable to review the logic for handling different data types and units, as this appears to be the main area of concern based on the function's purpose and interactions. This may involve revisiting the conditions for coercing object types to integer, handling out of range numbers, and parsing the date using different date units.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce', downcast='integer')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data <= self.max_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This updated function addresses the potential issues by using `pd.to_numeric` to coerce object types to integer and handling out of range numbers. It also ensures that the date_unit is correctly used for parsing the date data.

This fix is aligned with the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue by ensuring correct parsing and conversion of the ndarray-like data input into a date column.
