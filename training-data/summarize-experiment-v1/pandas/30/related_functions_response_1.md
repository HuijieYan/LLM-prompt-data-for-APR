Class docstring: The class Parser likely contains functions for parsing and converting data, potentially related to date and time formats.

`def _try_convert_to_date(self, data)`: This function appears to attempt to convert a given ndarray-like data input into a date column. It seems to handle different data types and formats, including handling empty data, converting object types to integer, checking for out of range numbers, and attempting conversion to date using different date units. The function also returns a boolean to indicate if the parsing was successful.

Overall, the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be a key part of the data parsing and conversion process within the Parser class. The interactions with different data types and formats suggest that this function is crucial for ensuring the correct parsing and conversion of data. Understanding how this function interacts with the broader data parsing and conversion processes within the Parser class could provide insights into why it might be failing.
