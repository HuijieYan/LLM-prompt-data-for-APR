The behavior that needs to be corrected in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it tries to convert the input data into a date column using multiple date units and this might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect parsing. The input 'data' might be an ndarray-like data that needs to be converted into a date format. The function aims to handle different data types and formats to ensure successful parsing.

Upon analyzing the function, it is identified that the issue lies in the way the date conversion logic in the function is implemented. Specifically, the handling of different date units and the potential for multiple execution paths through the for loop indicate potential issues that might arise during the date parsing and conversion process.

The problem cause analysis reveals that the function `_try_convert_to_date` handles the conversion of input data into a date column. It first checks if the input data is not empty and then tries to convert the data to an integer type. It also checks for out-of-range numbers in the data. The key issue arises in the next part, where the function attempts to convert the data to datetime using different date units. However, the multiple exception handling blocks and the return statements within the loop can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should be refactored to ensure consistent and accurate date parsing. By using a single execution path for date unit conversion and incorporating comprehensive exception handling, the function can be made more reliable and robust.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        new_data = data

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the data is first converted to an integer type, and then an attempt is made to convert it to datetime with error handling. This ensures a more streamlined and robust approach to handling date parsing and conversion. This updated logic is expected to resolve the issue described in the GitHub case.
