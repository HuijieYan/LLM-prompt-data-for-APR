The given function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the pandas library and is designed to convert a given array-like data input into a date column. It handles different types and formats, including empty data, object types, out of range numbers, and date unit conversions.

The potential error location can be identified by looking at the string enumeration process where the even and odd positions are reversed, leading to incorrect transformation.

The bug's cause may be due to incorrect character transformation after reversing the string, resulting in the incorrect output. This is supported by the failing test case and potentially relevant error messages from the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to reverse the string after applying the transformation, and starting the transformation from the first character of the reversed string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, True
``` 

This corrected version ensures that after subsequent conversion attempts in the for loop, the data and boolean outcomes are correctly returned.
