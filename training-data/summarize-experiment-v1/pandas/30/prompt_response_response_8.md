The issue in the provided function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the date parsing from the input data. The function attempts to handle different data types and formats, but there are potential issues within the logic of the function that could lead to incorrect output. 

Specifically, the following aspects could contribute to the bug:
1. The condition for checking if the input data is empty might not be handling the case properly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the input `data` is empty.
2. The error handling logic for converting object types to `int64` may not capture all potential errors, potentially leading to unexpected results.
3. The comparison and handling of numbers that are out of range might need further examination to ensure accurate results.
4. The overall parsing and conversion approach with different date units could lead to inconsistent or incorrect output.

To address the bug, the following steps could be considered:
1. Review and test the condition for checking empty data and ensure it handles the case properly.
2. Enhance the error handling logic for converting object types to `int64` to capture and handle potential errors more effectively.
3. Review and revise the comparison and handling of numbers that are out of range to ensure accurate results.
4. Refactor the parsing and conversion logic with different date units to ensure consistent and correct output.

Below is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function with potential improvements addressing the mentioned concerns:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:  # Adjusted condition to check if the input data is empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except Exception as e:  # Improved error handling for converting object types to int64
            print(f"Error converting to int64: {e}")
            return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)  # Modified to use "coerce" instead of "raise"
        except Exception as e:  # Improved error handling for date parsing
            print(f"Error parsing date unit {date_unit}: {e}")
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version of the function includes specific improvements targeted at addressing potential issues in the original logic. These improvements aim to handle empty data, improve error handling for object type conversion, enhance robustness when handling numbers out of range, and refine the date parsing and conversion approach. By addressing these concerns, the corrected function aims to provide more consistent and accurate output while also addressing any potential issues highlighted in the GitHub issue.
