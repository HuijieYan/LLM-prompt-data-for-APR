To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, it's important to carefully review the logic and identify potential error locations. Based on the description, the issue could be related to how the function processes different types of keys and levels, as well as how it handles the creation of the `BaseGrouper`.

Approaches for fixing the bug could involve revising the conditions and logic used to process different types of keys and levels, ensuring that each step correctly handles the input and leads to the creation of the `BaseGrouper` as intended.

In order to correct the bug, an updated version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code to be retained)

    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif not -1 <= level <= 0:
            raise ValueError("level should be between -1 and 0 inclusive")

        level = None
        key = group_axis

    # ... (existing code to be retained)

    # create the internals grouper
    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

It's important to note that the provided code is a potential fix based on the information given. The actual resolution might require additional changes based on specific use cases, input validation, and error handling. Additionally, thorough testing is essential to ensure that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
