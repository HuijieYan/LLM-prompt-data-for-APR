Without the specific error message, it is difficult to provide a detailed analysis. However, generally, to analyze an error message in the command line, you would need to look at the exact error being reported, the code that is being executed when the error occurs, and the source code that contains the bug.

Identifying the stack frames or messages closely related to the fault location would involve looking at the call stack at the point where the error occurred. This would show the sequence of function calls that led to the error, and can help determine the cause of the issue.

Simplifying the original error message would involve removing any unnecessary information and focusing on the key details, such as the type of error and the location where it occurred. This can make it easier to understand and troubleshoot the issue.

If you have a specific error message, test code, or buggy source code that you would like me to analyze, please provide that information and I would be happy to help further.
