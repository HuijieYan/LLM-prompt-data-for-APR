Based on the provided buggy function and the related information, it appears that the code has some issues related to selecting and grouping columns. The expected behavior of grouping by a particular column seems to be causing a KeyError, which indicates that there might be a problem with how the column names are being processed.

To resolve the issue, the code should be updated to correctly handle the groupby operation on columns to avoid the KeyError. Here's a suggested correction:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... skipping unchanged code ...

    if level is not None:  # Updated condition for handling level
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Unchanged code below this block
            # ...
        else:
            # Unchanged code below this block
            # ...
            if isinstance(level, str):
                # Updated code to handle level name
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            # Unchanged code below this block
            # ...

    # ... skipping remaining code ...

    # your existing code here

    return grouper, exclusions, obj  # Assuming the return values are as expected
```

Please note that the suggested correction addresses the specific issue related to handling groupby operations on columns. However, it's important to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that it behaves as expected and resolves the KeyError for grouping along columns. Additional adjustments might be necessary based on the specific error scenario or test cases.

This corrected version should resolve the reported issue and enable proper grouping by column names. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue description.
