The cause of the bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to a specific error described in the GitHub issue. The error occurs when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns. This results in an AttributeError, specifically "'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'".

The failure of the test case and the associated error message indicate a problem with how the `pivot_table` function handles multi-index columns. The error points to a part of the code where the function checks for the number of levels in the table columns and attempts to access the columns attribute.

Upon analysis, the cause of the bug might lie in the conditional check for the number of column levels `(table.columns.nlevels > 1)`. This check is likely intended to handle multi-index columns, but it is causing an AttributeError when applied to a Series object.

To resolve the bug, the conditional check for the number of column levels needs to be modified or refined to handle both DataFrame and Series objects returned by the `pivot_table` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    ...

    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # Existing code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is introduced to ensure that the "table" object is an instance of ABCDataFrame before attempting to access its column levels. This modification should resolve the AttributeError when working with multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function.

By updating the conditional check, the corrected function should now handle both single and multi-index column scenarios without raising an AttributeError, thereby addressing the reported GitHub issue.

Remember to integrate this fix into the corresponding GitHub issue for further review and potential integration into the pandas library.
