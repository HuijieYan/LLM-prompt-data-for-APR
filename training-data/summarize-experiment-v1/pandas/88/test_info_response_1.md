Without the specific error message, it is difficult to provide a detailed analysis. However, generally, to analyze an error message in the command line, you would need to look at the exact error being reported, the specific command or code that caused the error, and the relevant source code or test code that is related to the error.

Stack frames in the error message typically show the sequence of function calls and the corresponding memory address at the time of the error. This can help in identifying the fault location within the code.

To simplify the original error message, you would remove any unnecessary or technical details and focus on the essential information, such as the specific error being reported and the relevant code or command that caused the error. This simplified version can help in better understanding and troubleshooting the issue.
