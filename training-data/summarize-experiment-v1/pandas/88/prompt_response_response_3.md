The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The error message reports that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns', which indicates a problem with the handling of multi-index columns in the pivot operation.

To fix this issue, the code for the `pivot_table` function needs to be updated to properly handle multi-index columns and avoid the AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object.

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = DataFrame(table)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return table
```

In the corrected code:
- The DataFrame is explicitly constructed using the `DataFrame` constructor to ensure that the result is always a DataFrame, whether it's being unstacked or processed with margins.
- This change helps to ensure that the AttributeError issue related to 'Series' object with no 'columns' attribute is avoided, and the function handles multi-index columns correctly.

With this correction, the pivot_table function should properly handle pivot operations with multi-index columns and avoid the reported AttributeError issue.
