The potential error in the buggy function lies at the part where the function `_get_level_number()` is used to get the level number based on the given value. The error occurs when `'A'` is given as a parameter to `_get_level_number()`, causing a KeyError when this level is not found in the index names.

The bug is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names using `('.'A','a.')`. The failing test occurs because the named tuple index `('A', 'a')` cannot be directly specified within the `unstack` method. This results in the KeyError during the function execution, and the bug is evident in the error message given in the corresponding issue.

The actual input/output variable values:
- Input: Index names `('A', 'a')` passed to `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` method.
- Output: KeyError 'Level A not found'

The expected input/output variable values:
- Input: Standard command, e.g., `s.unstack(n)`
- Output: The expected unstacked result, without any KeyError.

The GitHub Issue Information:
- The issue is posted in the pandas repository.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the issue are provided with the input and failing test.
- The issue classified the problem as 'KeyError'

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the scenario where the input `clocs` refers to a MultiIndex with tuple names. The function should correctly process the tuple value `('A', 'a')` as a level name.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the mentioned issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Changed to handle MultiIndex with tuple names
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        cnames = clocs
        clocs = [data.index.names.index(cloc) if cloc in data.index.names else None for cloc in cnames]
    else:
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Implement the remaining part of the function
    # ...
``` 

In this updated code, specifically, the expression `data.index.names.index(cloc)` is used to get the level number if `cloc` exists in the MultiIndex names. After this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function is expected to handle the named tuple scenario and pass the failing test in the GitHub issue.
