The issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` causing weakrefs to be lost.

Potential bug location: The `_engine` function might be failing due to the weak reference not being passed correctly to the `_engine_type` class.

Bug's cause:
(a) The `_engine` function appears to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but may not be passing it correctly to the `_engine_type` class.
(b) The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable array holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
(c) The failing test involves checking for monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex`. 
(d) The error message is not provided, but based on the description, it seems that there is an issue with weak references being dropped before intended.
(e) The actual input/output variable values are not provided.
(f) The expected input/output variable values are not provided.
(g) The GitHub issue mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is passed correctly to the `_engine_type` class.
2. Verify that the caching and weak referencing mechanism is functioning as intended.
3. Investigate the sequence of operations leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

Corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use period() to obtain the referenced object
```
With this fix, the weak reference is obtained using `period()` and passed to the `_engine_type` class, ensuring that the weak reference is preserved.

This corrected code should help address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
