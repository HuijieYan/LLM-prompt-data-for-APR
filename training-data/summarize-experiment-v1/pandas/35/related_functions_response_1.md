Class docstring: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It also includes a list of attributes and methods for working with periods.

`_engine` function: This function is a cached readonly property that is likely used to initialize the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with the current `PeriodIndex` object and its length as parameters.

`_engine_type` class: This class is not defined in the provided code snippet, but based on the usage within the `_engine` function, it is likely used for engine initialization and manipulation specific to the `PeriodIndex` class.

`cache_readonly` decorator: This decorator likely caches the result of the `_engine` function to improve performance by only computing the result once and then returning the cached result on subsequent calls.

`weakref.ref(self)`: This line is used to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid potential reference cycles. It is then used as a parameter when creating an instance of the `_engine_type` class.

Understanding the interactions and roles of these related functions and classes could provide insights into why the `_engine` function is failing and how it fits within the larger codebase.
