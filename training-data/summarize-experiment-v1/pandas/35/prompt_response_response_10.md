The potential error in the provided function lies in the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is used to cache the result of the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference to `self` is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type`. This could potentially result in a None value being passed to the `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

The bug's cause is related to the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object, where it might be dropped before it's intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function needs to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` to avoid potential reference drops.

The corrected code for the `_engine` function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, maintain a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained, ensuring that it is correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.

This fix should address the current issue related to the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, preventing reference drops and ensuring the expected behavior when checking for monotonicity.
