The issue seems to be related to a bug related to weakrefs within the `PeriodIndex` class when used in conjunction with a `MultiIndex`. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error being raised when checking for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` needs to be handled correctly to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` without any loss of reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` without any loss of reference.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`.
