The potential error in the provided code lies in the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is likely causing the issue when trying to initialize the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the weak reference `period`. The weakref.ref(self) is creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, and it is then used as a parameter when creating an instance of the `_engine_type` class. However, there seems to be an issue with the weak reference being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` being initialized with a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be maintained until the initialization of the `PeriodEngine` is completed. This may involve reassessing the usage of weak references and ensuring that they are properly handled to avoid dropping them prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function with potential fix:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_obj
```

In this fixed code, the `engine_obj` is generated using the weak reference `period` without dropping it prematurely. This would address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is initialized with the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
