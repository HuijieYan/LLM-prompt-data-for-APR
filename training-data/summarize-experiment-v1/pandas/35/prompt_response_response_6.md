The issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` causing weakrefs to be lost.

Potential bug location: The `_engine` function might be failing due to the weak reference not being passed correctly to the `_engine_type`.

Bug's cause: The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the error.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is passed correctly to the `_engine_type`.
2. Check for any potential issues with weak referencing and object lifecycle management in the `_engine` function.

Corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
