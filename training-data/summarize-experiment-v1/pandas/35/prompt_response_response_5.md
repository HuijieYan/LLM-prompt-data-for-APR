The potential error in the provided code lies in the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is likely causing the weak reference to be dropped before it is intended to.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The `_engine` function uses a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before it is intended to, resulting in a None value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
(b) The `cache_readonly` decorator caches the result of the `_engine` function, which could potentially be causing the weak reference to be dropped prematurely.
(c) The failing test seems to be related to the loss of weakrefs in a specific use case, causing an error when checking the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex`.
(d) The error message is not provided, so the specific error being encountered is unclear.
(e) Actual input/output variable values are not provided.
(f) The expected input/output variable values are not provided.
(g) The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the problem and the expected output.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed. This may require modifying the caching behavior of the `_engine` function or addressing how weak references are handled in the `cache_readonly` decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is used within the `_engine` function, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that weakrefs are not lost prematurely.
