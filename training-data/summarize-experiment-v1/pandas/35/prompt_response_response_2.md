The potential error in the provided code lies in the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is likely causing the issue when trying to initialize the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class.

From the provided information, it seems that the `_engine` function is failing in its attempt to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and its length as parameters. This failure of engine initialization seems to be causing an error when working with `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex` objects, specifically when trying to access the levels of the `MultiIndex`.

The original error message and specific test case are not available, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. However, based on the description, the issue appears to be related to the loss of weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`. This loss results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

A potential approach for fixing this bug could involve revisiting the usage of weakrefs and ensure that the intended weak referencing mechanism is preserved during the initialization of the engine for `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex` objects.

Here's a corrected version of the provided code for the `_engine` function taking weakrefs into account:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used to obtain the weakly referenced object, and then it is passed to the `_engine_type` class for initialization. This change ensures that the weak referencing mechanism is maintained when initializing the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class.

By applying this fix, the issue with the loss of weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` should be resolved.
