The issue seems to be related to a bug related to weakrefs within the `PeriodIndex` class when used in conjunction with a `MultiIndex`. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error being raised when checking for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function, which is a cached read-only property, needs to be modified to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is no longer required by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly maintained until it is used to initialize the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report. With this fix, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct `PeriodIndex` object, and the expected output, as described in the GitHub issue, will be achieved.
