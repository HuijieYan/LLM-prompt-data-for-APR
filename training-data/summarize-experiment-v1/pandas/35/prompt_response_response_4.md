The issue seems to be related to a bug related to weakrefs within the `PeriodIndex` class when used in conjunction with a `MultiIndex`. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error being raised when checking for monotonicity.

To fix the bug, the weak referencing of `self` within the `_engine` function seems to be the potential cause. This might lead to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the unexpected behavior.

A potential approach to fixing the bug could be to modify the weak referencing of `self` within the `_engine` function to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` maintains its correct reference before being used to initialize the `PeriodEngine`. Additionally, addressing any issues related to weak referencing and garbage collection for the `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex` classes might also resolve the bug.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, the `PeriodIndex` object will maintain its reference and be correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, potentially resolving the issue with weakrefs being lost prematurely.

This change should help resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs when working with `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, ensuring that the expected output for the test case is achieved.
