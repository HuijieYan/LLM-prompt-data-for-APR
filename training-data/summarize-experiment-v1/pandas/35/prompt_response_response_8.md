The issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` causing weakrefs to be lost.

Potential bug location: The `_engine` function might be failing to properly handle weak references when creating an instance of the `_engine_type` class.

Bug's cause:
(a) The `_engine` function appears to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but may not be using it properly when instantiating the `_engine_type`.
(b) The failing test involves checking the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` and indicates that weakrefs are being dropped unexpectedly.
(d) The corresponding error message is not provided.
(e) The actual input/output variable values are not available.
(f) The expected input/output variable values are that the test for monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` should return True.
(g) The GitHub issue describes the problem of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er dropped before intended, so the `PeriodEngine` gets a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function when instantiating the `_engine_type` class.
2. Review the weak reference logic and interactions within the `PeriodIndex` and `_engine_type` to identify and resolve weak reference dropping issues.

Corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(period), len(self))  # Use weakref.proxy to properly handle weak references
```
With this fix, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is used properly when instantiating the `_engine_type`, potentially resolving the issue described in the GitHub thread.
