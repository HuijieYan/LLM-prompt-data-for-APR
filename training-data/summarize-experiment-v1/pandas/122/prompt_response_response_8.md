The issue's relevant context and comments:
```text
I found an issue with the DataFrame.equals() method. It incorrectly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations.

When comparing two DataFrames with identical data but differently ordered columns, the equals() method incorrectly returns True, when it should return False.

This behavior seems to be caused by the internal implementation of the equals() method, which does not properly handle the comparison of identical blocks with different locations.

This issue can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results when using the equals() method to compare DataFrames with differently ordered columns.

I have tested this issue with pandas 0.25.0 and Python 3.6.8, and the problem persists.

I hope this issue can be addressed and fixed in a future release of pandas.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

#Approach to fix the bug
The bug in the equals() method seems to be related to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations. To fix this bug, it may be necessary to refactor the internal implementation of the equals() method to properly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

It may also be beneficial to add specific test cases for comparing DataFrames with differently ordered columns to ensure that the equals() method behaves as expected in these scenarios.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to add logic to the equals() method that explicitly checks for identical blocks with different locations and ensures that they are correctly identified as unequal.

By enhancing the equals() method to handle these cases, the bug could be effectively addressed and the method would return the correct results when comparing DataFrames with differently ordered columns.

#Buggy code:
```python
class BlockManager:
    ...
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

#Fixed code:
```python
class BlockManager:
    ...
    def equals(self, other):
        # Check if the axes are equal
        if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
            return False

        # Consolidate the internal data
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        # Check if the number of blocks are equal
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort the blocks to ensure consistent comparison order
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

        # Compare each block
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
