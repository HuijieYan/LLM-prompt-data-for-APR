Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, such as the command line, test code, and buggy source code. However, I can provide a general outline for how to approach analyzing an error message on the command line.

1. Identify the error message: Look for any error messages or stack traces that are output to the command line when running the test code or buggy source code.

2. Analyze the error message: Look for any specific error codes, error descriptions, or stack traces that indicate where the fault occurred in the code.

3. Identify related stack frames or messages: Look for any related stack frames or error messages that indicate which part of the code is closely related to the fault location.

4. Simplify the original error message: If possible, try to simplify the error message by removing any unnecessary information and focusing on the specific details of the fault location.

Once you have identified the error message and related stack frames, you can use this information to troubleshoot and debug the issue in the test code or buggy source code.
