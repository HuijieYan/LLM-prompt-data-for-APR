Class docstring: The BlockManager class is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. It manages a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays. The related functions `as_array`, `equals`, `canonicalize`, and `_consolidate_inplace` are likely used to manipulate and compare the data within the BlockManager.

`def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None) -> None`: This function likely converts the data within the BlockManager into an array, with an option to transpose the array and specify specific items.

`def _consolidate_inplace(self) -> None`: This function likely consolidates the data within the BlockManager in place, possibly to optimize or prepare it for further processing.

`def equals(self, other) -> bool`: This function likely compares the data within the BlockManager with another data structure, returning a boolean value indicating whether they are equal.

`def canonicalize(block) -> None`: This function likely organizes or arranges the data blocks within the BlockManager in a canonical way, using a specified logic or set of rules, for further comparison.

`self._consolidate_inplace()` function call: Calls the `_consolidate_inplace` function to consolidate the internal data before comparison.

`self.blocks` and `other.blocks`: These variables likely store the data blocks within the BlockManager and another similar data structure for comparison.
