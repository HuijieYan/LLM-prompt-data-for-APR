The bug in the function is likely being caused by incorrect comparison logic, leading to the `DataFrame.equals()` method wrongly returning `True` in a specific case.

One approach to fix this bug could be to review and correct the comparison logic within the `equals` function to ensure it returns the correct result.

Additionally, it may be helpful to review the test case provided in the GitHub issue and ensure that the comparison is accurately assessing the expected behavior.

Here's a potential correction to the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the comparison logic within the `equals` function, taking into account the specific issue raised in the GitHub report. It should address the bug and ensure that `DataFrame.equals()` correctly returns the expected result for the provided test case.

Please note that this correction is based on the details provided in the GitHub issue and may need further testing to ensure the complete resolution of the bug.
