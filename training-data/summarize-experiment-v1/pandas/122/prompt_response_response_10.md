The potential error location within the provided `equals` function is the comparison of `self.blocks` with `other.blocks` using the `equals` method.

The bug's cause is that the `equals` method does not properly compare the internal data blocks of two BlockManager objects, leading to incorrect equality results.

Approaches for fixing the bug include implementing a correct comparison logic for the internal data blocks, ensuring that the data blocks are consolidated and ordered before comparison, and handling any potential edge cases in the comparison process.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected code, the `equals` function now ensures that the internal data blocks of both BlockManager objects are properly consolidated and ordered before comparison. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and produce the expected output for the `equals` method when comparing two BlockManagers.
