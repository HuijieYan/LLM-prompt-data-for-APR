The given source code is actually not reflective of the issue provided in the GitHub report. However, we can still analyze and provide a corrected version of the buggy function.

Based on the function provided, the potential error location is in the `canonicalize` function, where it's used to sort the data blocks within the `BlockManager`.

The bug is likely caused by the `canonicalize` function not properly handling and organizing the blocks within the `BlockManager` for comparison, leading to a mismatch in the comparison process.

To fix the bug, we can revise the `canonicalize` function to ensure it correctly organizes and sorts the data blocks. We can also ensure that the comparison process properly accounts for any unconsolidated blocks, such as Categorical blocks, to avoid misidentification during the comparison process.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # revised canonicalize block order to properly handle unconsolidated blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        if block._can_consolidate():
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        else:
            return (block._can_consolidate(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle and compare the data blocks, taking into account the proper organization and identification of unconsolidated blocks, thus addressing the reported issue in the GitHub bug report.
