The issue describes a problem with the `DataFrame.equals()` method, which incorrectly returns True in the case of identical blocks with different locations. The expected output is False, but the actual output is not mentioned.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks based on more than just their content, specifically taking into account their locations.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function improves the comparison of blocks by taking into account their locations, ensuring that the `equals()` method produces the expected output.

The code snippet has been updated to consider the actual locations of the blocks, as per the GitHub issue, and should now appropriately return False in the given test case.
