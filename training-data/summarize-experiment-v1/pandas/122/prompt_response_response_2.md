The `equals` function in the BlockManager class seems to be incorrectly comparing the internal data blocks of two BlockManagers for equality. The comparison logic involves consolidating the data, sorting the data blocks, and then checking if each block is equal to its counterpart in the other BlockManager.

The bug seems to be related to the logic used for canonicalizing and sorting the data blocks. This may result in incorrect comparison outcomes, causing the function to erroneously return `True` when the data blocks are actually different.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic in the `equals` function need to be carefully reviewed and potentially re-implemented. Specifically, the canonicalization and sorting process based on block type and manager locations may need to be revised to ensure correct comparison outcomes.

Here's a potential fix for the bug:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize and sort the data blocks based on a more reliable criterion
    def canonicalize(block):
        # Use a more robust criterion for sorting, such as the actual data contents
        return block.data

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This fix proposes to use the actual data contents as the criterion for canonicalization and sorting of the data blocks. This should help ensure that the comparison outcomes are accurate and that the `equals` function returns the correct result for different BlockManagers.

Please note that this fix is a general suggestion and may need further refinement based on the specifics of the bug and the behavior of the `equals` function.

It's important to thoroughly test the modified `equals` function to ensure that it correctly identifies the equality of BlockManagers and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
