The bug seems to be related to the DataFrame.equals() method in pandas, which is returning True even when the data blocks have different locations. This is likely because the comparison logic in the equals() method is not handling the block locations correctly.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the equals() method needs to be updated to consider the block locations when checking for equality. This may involve iterating over the blocks and their locations to ensure that they are considered in the comparison.

The corrected code for the buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class could be:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks and their locations
    for blk, o_blk in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not blk.equals(o_blk):
            return False

        # Check for block locations
        if not blk.mgr_locs.equals(o_blk.mgr_locs):
            return False

    return True
```

With this fix, the equals() method should now correctly handle comparisons of data blocks with different locations, ensuring that it returns the expected output for the given test case. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
