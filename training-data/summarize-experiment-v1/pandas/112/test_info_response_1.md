Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message on the command line, it is important to first identify the specific error code or message that is being displayed. Then, you can look at the associated test code and buggy source code to see where the fault may be located.

Once you have identified the error message and associated code, you can look at the stack frames or error messages that are closely related to the fault location. This can help you pinpoint the specific line or function that is causing the error.

As an example, if the original error message is "Segmentation fault (core dumped)", you would want to look at the stack frames and associated code to see where the segmentation fault is occurring. You may find a specific function or variable that is causing the issue.

To simplify the original error message, you could simply say "Segmentation fault" to convey the same information in a more concise way.
