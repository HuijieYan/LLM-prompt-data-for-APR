## Corrections to the Buggy Function

Based on the provided buggy function and the related class and methods documentation, it seems that the bug may be related to the handling of overlapping indices and data type conversions within the `get_indexer()` function of the `IntervalIndex` class.

The function appears to handle different cases based on the type of input index and whether it is an `IntervalIndex` or not. The condition for handling `IntervalIndex` instances, as well as non-object data types, seems to be correctly implemented.

However, the problematic section might occur when dealing with object data types. The code currently uses a for loop to iterate over object-type index elements, and then attempts to obtain the location using `get_loc()`. This approach might be causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we should consider the following approaches:
1. Review the error message and stack traces associated with the failing test to identify the specific location of the bug within the `get_indexer()` function.
2. Analyze the input data that triggers the bug and test cases to understand the specific conditions causing the issue.
3. Evaluate the interactions with the related methods and operations, such as `left()`, `right()`, `closed()`, `values()`, `dtype()`, `is_overlapping()`, `equals()`, `_maybe_convert_i8()`, and `_check_method()`, to ensure proper handling of input data and indices.
4. Consider refactoring the object-type index handling to ensure accurate and efficient location retrieval.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer()` function to address potential issues related to handling object-type indices:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code for handling IntervalIndex instances unchanged
        # ...

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    else:
        indexer = self.get_indexer_for_object_dtype(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)


def get_indexer_for_object_dtype(self, target_as_index: Index) -> np.ndarray:
    indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype=np.intp)
    for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
        try:
            loc = self.get_loc(key)
        except KeyError:
            loc = -1
        indexer[i] = loc
    return indexer
```

In this updated code, the handling of object-type indices is extracted into a separate method `get_indexer_for_object_dtype()` to ensure clarity and maintainability. The method explicitly initializes an empty array to store the results, iterates over the index elements, and directly populates the indexer array with the retrieved locations. This approach avoids potential issues with using a list and ensures that the indexer array contains the correct location results for object-type indices.

By implementing these fixes, the `get_indexer()` function should be able to handle object-type indices correctly and address potential bugs associated with index location retrieval.
