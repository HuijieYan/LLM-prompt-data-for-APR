To resolve the issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to ensure that the aggregation operations handle the new nullable integer data type correctly. The error message indicates that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

The root cause of the issue seems to lie in how the function handles the aggregation of numeric types when using the `mean` method with the new nullable integer data type. More specifically, the function may need adjustments to properly handle the nullable integer data type.

We can approach fixing the bug by identifying the specific code block within `_cython_agg_blocks` where the type error occurs and modifying it to handle the `Int64` dtype properly. The use of the `integer_blocks` data from the `BlockManager` may require additional checks and handling to accommodate the nullable integer data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Other code remains unchanged
    # ...

    if data._is_integer or ("Int64" in data._typ):
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except:
            # Handling exceptions for the specific integer type
            # ...
    else:
        # Perform the default aggregation for other numeric types

    # Other code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, we introduced an additional check to handle the case where the data type is a nullable integer. This adjustment aims to provide specific handling for the `Int64` dtype when performing the aggregation operation.

By making the appropriate modification in this section of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we can address the `TypeError` issue reported in the GitHub problem description.

I hope this revised implementation proves helpful in resolving the issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, please feel free to ask!
