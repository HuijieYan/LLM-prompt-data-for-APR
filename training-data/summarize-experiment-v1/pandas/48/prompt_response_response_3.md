To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the following approach can be taken:

1. Check the input arguments `self`, `how`, `alt`, `numeric_only`, and `min_count` for any potential issues.
2. Validate the logic used to handle different block types and operations within the for loop.
3. Address the conditional statements and ensure they handle various scenarios appropriately.
4. Verify the aggregation process and the control flow within the function to identify any potential inconsistencies.


The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, locs = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        ) if isinstance(self.grouper, GroupBy) else get_groupby(block.values, self.grouper) \
            .aggregate(how) 
                
        if result is None:
            # we cannot perform the operation, exclude the block
            continue
            
        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # Handle the result and append the aggregate block
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            
            # Update the aggregate items
            agg_items.extend(data.items[locs])
        
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function ensures proper aggregation handling and returns the appropriate result based on the input data and specified aggregation method.

By making these changes, the issue with calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype should be addressed. The corrected logic and updated aggregation process should resolve the reported bug on the provided GitHub issue.
