The issue raised on GitHub involves a TypeError that occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the `Int64` dtype. The error does not occur with other aggregation functions such as `min`, `max`, or `first` but occurs with `median` and `std`. The expected output of calling `mean` on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object is provided in the issue description.

The bug likely arises due to a data type conflict or mishandling when performing the `mean` operation on the grouped data with the `Int64` dtype.

One approach to fixing this bug is to analyze the internal implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically where the data types are checked or modified during aggregation. It may be necessary to handle the `Int64` data type separately to ensure that the aggregation functions behave as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = result.astype('float64')
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            # ... (rest of the code)
    
    # ... (rest of the code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to detect the `Int64` dtype in the data blocks. If the data block has the `Int64` dtype, it is explicitly converted to the `float64` dtype to ensure that the aggregation functions behave correctly with nullable integer data.

By making this adjustment, the bug related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype should be resolved.

This correction aligns with the GitHub issue and should resolve the TypeError encountered when applying `mean` and other aggregation functions to grouped data with the `Int64` dtype.
