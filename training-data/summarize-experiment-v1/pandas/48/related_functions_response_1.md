Class docstring: The `DataFrameGroupBy` class likely performs operations on grouped data, such as aggregating, transforming, and filtering.

`def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs)`: This method likely applies a function to the grouped data. It probably takes a function as an argument and calls it on the data.

`def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager`: This function is likely used to retrieve the data that will be aggregated. It probably returns a `BlockManager` object containing the data to be aggregated.

`_cython_agg_blocks`: This is the problematic function that needs attention. It likely performs aggregation on the grouped data based on a specified method and parameters. The function seems to involve handling various cases related to aggregating numeric data and potentially splitting data blocks. The function appears to have many internal operations and checks to handle different scenarios for aggregation.
