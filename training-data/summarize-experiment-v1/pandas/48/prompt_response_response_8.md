To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to identify the specific issue that is causing the error in the context of the GitHub issue. Unfortunately, the provided code is a different function from the one that is causing the error in the GitHub issue.

Given the specific details provided in the GitHub issue, where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles this scenario correctly.

An approach for fixing this bug could involve adding conditional logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the case when `Int64` dtype is encountered during aggregation. The function should be updated to correctly handle the aggregation of `Int64` dtype to ensure a TypeError is not raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the
        # items we have removed
        # really should be done in internals :<
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    # Handle Int64 dtype during aggregation
    if isinstance(data.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        # Handle aggregation for Int64 dtype
        result = data._mgr.astype("float64")._mgr.aggregate(how)
        return [result], None

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The above code includes proper handling of the `Int64` dtype scenario during aggregation to prevent the TypeError issue. This correction should resolve the specific issue reported in the GitHub bug.
