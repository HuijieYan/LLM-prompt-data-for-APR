Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for specific details such as the command line input, the test code that triggered the error, and the source code where the bug may be located. 

Identify the stack frames or messages that are closely related to the fault location. This can help pinpoint where the error occurred in the code.

Once you have identified the relevant information, you can simplify the original error message by removing any extraneous details and focusing on the specific error that occurred.

If you can provide the error message, I would be happy to help further analyze and simplify it for you.
