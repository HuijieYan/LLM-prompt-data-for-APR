The potential error in the buggy function is in the section where the function `column_op` is used to perform the column-by-column operation based on the `right` parameter. This is where the bug may be causing the function to operate incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

The bug's cause could be that the function is not correctly handling the different types of `right` parameters, such as scalars, DataFrames, or Series. This could lead to incorrect data being generated by the `column_op` function, resulting in unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the different types of `right` parameters correctly and ensure that the `column_op` function produces the expected outputs for each scenario. This may involve making adjustments to the conditional branches that handle different parameter types and ensuring that the `column_op` function behaves as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate row-by-row when called via left._combine_match_columns
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]), axis=1)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

The corrected function above addresses the issues with handling different types of `right` parameters and ensures that the `column_op` function behaves as expected in each scenario. This should resolve the bug in the original function and produce the correct outputs for the given test cases.
