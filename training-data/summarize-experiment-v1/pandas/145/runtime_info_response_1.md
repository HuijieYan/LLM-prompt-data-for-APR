The bug in the function is caused by the fact that the index used to check for odd or even positions is based on the reversed string. This means that for the original input, the function is actually applying the transformation based on the characters in their original positions, rather than in the reversed string.

To fix this bug, the function should reverse the input string first and then apply the transformation. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    result = ""
    reversed_text = text[::-1]  # reverse the input string
    for i, char in enumerate(reversed_text):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result
```

With this fix, the function will correctly reverse the input string before applying the transformation, ensuring that the characters are modified based on their positions in the reversed string. After applying this fix, the function should produce the correct outputs for the given test cases.
