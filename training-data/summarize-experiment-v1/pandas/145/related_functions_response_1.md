Class docstring: This `dispatch_to_series` function is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching the operation to the Series implementation column-by-column.

`column_op(a, b)`: This nested function is used by `dispatch_to_series` to perform the column-by-column operation when `right` is a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. It seems to apply the function `func` to each column and return the result.

`lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`: This function seems to be used to convert the `right` parameter to an item when it is of zero dimensions.

`lib.is_scalar(right)`: Checks if `right` is a scalar or single value.

`pandas.core.computation.expressions.evaluate()`: This function is used to evaluate the `column_op` function and generate new data based on the operation.

The function `dispatch_to_series` interacts with these related functions and classes to handle different scenarios for the `right` parameter. Understanding how these interactions work may help developers identify why the function is failing.
