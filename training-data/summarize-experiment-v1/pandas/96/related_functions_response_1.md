Class `BusinessHourMixin` is the primary class containing the `apply` function mentioned. This function interacts with a large number of other functions within the same file. It also calls functions such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset` within the same class. Additionally, it calls the function `apply_wraps` defined in the same file but in a different context. The `apply` function interacts with datetime objects and uses a variety of conditionals and adjustments to calculate and return a modified datetime object. The issue with this function could likely be related to the way it handles datetime inputs and performs the adjustments. The interactions with other functions and numerous manipulations required for business hour calculations make it essential to scrutinize the function's logic.
