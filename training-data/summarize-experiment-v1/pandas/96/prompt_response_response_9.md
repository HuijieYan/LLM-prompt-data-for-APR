## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_96/pandas/tseries/offsets.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,

## Summary of Related Functions

Class `BusinessHourMixin` is the primary class containing the `apply` function mentioned. This function interacts with a large number of other functions within the same file. It also calls functions such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset` within the same class. Additionally, it calls the function `apply_wraps` defined in the same file but in a different context. The `apply` function interacts with datetime objects and uses a variety of conditionals and adjustments to calculate and return a modified datetime object. The issue with this function could likely be related to the way it handles datetime inputs and performs the adjustments. The interactions with other functions and numerous manipulations required for business hour calculations make it essential to scrutinize the function's logic.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Error message:
"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 10 out of bounds for length 10
    at TestCode.main(TestCode.java:8)"

In this error message, it is reported that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException has occurred in the TestCode.java file at line 8. The error indicates that the index 10 is out of bounds for an array with length 10, suggesting that the code is trying to access an index beyond the size of the array.

The error message is closely related to the fault location at line 8 of the TestCode.java file. The stack trace also points to the main method as the entry point of the error.

Simplified error message:
"Array index 10 is out of bounds for array of length 10 in TestCode.java at line 8"


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug in the function is in the step where it alternates the case of the characters. The current implementation checks for the index being even or odd for the reversed string, but it should be checking for even or odd indices in the original string. To fix this, we need to reverse the text and then iterate through the original string to apply the case transformation.

Here's the fixed function:

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    text_reversed = text[::-1]  # Reverse the input string
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(text):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly apply the specified transformation to the input string, resulting in the expected output for both test cases.

# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
This code works fine

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
Output:

DatetimeIndex(['2020-11-25 10:00:00', '2020-11-25 11:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 12:00:00', '2020-11-25 13:00:00',

               '2020-11-27 13:00:00', '2020-11-27 14:00:00',

               '2020-12-02 12:00:00'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='CBH')
If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',end='2020-11-27 16:00:00',
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
```

Solution:
The `apply` function provided seems to be a fixable part of the code in the GitHub issue mentioned. The issue is with the functionality of the `date_range` method with periods and adding holidays. To address this issue, it's crucial to debug the code in the `apply` method and correct any potential bugs that might be impacting the behavior of `date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

The problem in the `apply` method seems to be related to how it handles datetime calculations and adjustments. By thoroughly analyzing and fixing the `apply` method, the issue with the behavior of `date_range` when using periods and holidays can be resolved.

Therefore, the corrected code for the `apply` method should be tested alongside the `date_range` functionality to verify that the fix addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
