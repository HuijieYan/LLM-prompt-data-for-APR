The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if the error message contains the word "usage:". The bug seems to be a result of assuming that the error message is always in the `stderr` of the command, which may not be the case.

The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the error message will always be in `command.stderr`, hence leading to an `IndexError` when the logic is applied.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if there is an error message available and whether it contains the "usage:" keyword. If the error message is not in the `stderr`, then it should be checked in the `stdout` instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function that handles this scenario:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    error_message = command.stderr if command.stderr else command.stdout
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in error_message)
```

By checking for the error message in both `stderr` and `stdout`, this correction should resolve the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works as expected in various scenarios.
