The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the second element of the split script with the string 'stash'.

The bug's cause is due to the function trying to access an element of the split script without first checking if it has at least two elements. This results in an IndexError when the split script does not contain enough elements.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return len(script) >= 2 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly check if the split script contains at least two elements and then compare the second element with the string 'stash', resolving the IndexError issue.
