Without the specific error message, it is difficult to provide an analysis and a simplified version. However, in general, when analyzing an error message in a command line, it is important to look for the specific error code or message that identifies the issue. 

The test code and buggy source code should also be examined to understand the context in which the error occurred. Look for any relevant stack frames or error messages that can help pinpoint the fault location.

Once the specific error message and context are identified, it may be possible to simplify the original error message by removing unnecessary technical jargon and focusing on the core issue.
