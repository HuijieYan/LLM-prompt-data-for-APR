The buggy function `match` has a potential error location in its conditional statement `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This line checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', and also checks if 'usage:' is in the command's standard error.

The bug's cause is that the conditional statement does not handle cases where the command script might not contain the necessary elements, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug:
1. We first need to ensure that the command.script is not empty before conducting any checks.
2. We can also check if the length of the command.script is at least 2 before attempting to access the second word. If the length is less than 2, it means the command script doesn't contain enough words to perform the required comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function `match`:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) < 2:
        return False
    return (words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the `IndexError` is avoided and the function passes the failing test by correctly handling cases where the command script is too short.
