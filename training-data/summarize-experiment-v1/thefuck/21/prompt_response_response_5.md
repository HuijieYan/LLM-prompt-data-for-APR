The buggy function seems to have an issue with how it checks the command input. It checks if the command script has a specific word, 'stash', as the second word and if the string 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

The potential error location lies in the match function, where it checks if the script split at the command has the second word as 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr.

The bug's cause is that the match function does not handle cases where the split command list may not have an element at index 1 and does not handle cases where the command stderr does not contain 'usage:'.

To fix the bug, we need to add checks to see if the split command list has enough elements and if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. If either of these conditions is not met, we should return False.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    if len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected code includes additional checks to ensure that the script split list has enough elements and that 'usage:' is present in the command stderr. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test for the specific case identified.
