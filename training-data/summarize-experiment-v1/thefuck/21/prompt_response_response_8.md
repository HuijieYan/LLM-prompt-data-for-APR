The potential error location within the buggy function lies in the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the return statement in the `match` function. This code attempts to split the script part of the command and access the second element, which is prone to causing an `IndexError` if the script doesn't contain enough elements after splitting.

The bug's cause is that the `match` function expects the command to have a second element after splitting the script, but if the script doesn't contain enough elements, it raises an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the script contains enough elements after splitting before accessing the second element. We can check the length of the split script to prevent the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function now checks the length of the split script before accessing the second element, preventing the `IndexError`.

This corrected code should ensure that the program passes the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failure.
