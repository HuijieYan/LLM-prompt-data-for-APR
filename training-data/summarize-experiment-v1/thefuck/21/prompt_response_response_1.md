The buggy function `match` checks if the command contains the word "stash" and if the error message includes "usage:". If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line where it checks for the presence of "stash" in the command script and "usage:" in the command stderr.

The bug's cause is related to the function not handling cases where the command script does not contain enough elements after splitting. It leads to an IndexError when trying to access `split()[1]` without checking if it exists first.

To fix the bug, we should check if the script has at least 2 elements after splitting and then compare the second element with "stash".

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this fix, the function should now handle the case of insufficient elements in the command script, and it will return True only when "stash" is the second element and "usage:" is in the command's stderr.

This change resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just "git" and the error message contains an IndexError.
