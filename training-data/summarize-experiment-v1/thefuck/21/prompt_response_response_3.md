The buggy function is in the `git_fix_stash.py` file and is intended to match the `git stash` command with the 'usage:' string in the command's stderr. The function is supposed to return `True` if the conditions are met and `False` otherwise.

The potential error location is in the `match` function at the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

The bug's cause is that the function does not take into account the possibility of an empty `command.script.split()` or the absence of the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle cases where the `command.script` is not split into enough parts and should not throw an `IndexError`.
