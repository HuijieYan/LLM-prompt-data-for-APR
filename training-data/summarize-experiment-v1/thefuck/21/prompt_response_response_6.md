The problem with the buggy function is that it references the second element of a split command script without first validating if there are more than one element in the script. This results in an `IndexError` when the split command does not have enough elements.

We can resolve this bug by first checking the length of the split command script and then accessing the second element.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly check for the presence of the 'stash' keyword in the command script and the 'usage:' keyword in the command standard error, avoiding the `IndexError` that occurred previously.
