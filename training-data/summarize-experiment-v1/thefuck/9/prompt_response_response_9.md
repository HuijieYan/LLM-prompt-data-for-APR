The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts`. This leads to an incorrect suggestion for the new git command. As a result, the test case designed to parse the stderr and produce the correct command fails.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and generate the correct new command based on the parsed data from the git stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
            

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected function, the program should now pass the failing test and generate the correct new git command as expected. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
