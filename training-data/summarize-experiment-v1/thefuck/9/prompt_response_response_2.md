The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `git push` command without considering the following arguments. This results in an incorrect command being generated, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and ensure that the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option itself

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```

With the corrected code, the program should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to the broken `git push -u` suggestions.
