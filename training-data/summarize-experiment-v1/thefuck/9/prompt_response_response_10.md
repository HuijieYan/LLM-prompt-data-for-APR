The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the 'git push' command and replace the 'push' argument with the suggested upstream branch. However, the bug occurs because the function is incorrectly trying to access a part of the command that may not always be present.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic that tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the command. This logic does not account for cases where these arguments may not be present, leading to potential errors.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments are not present in the command. This leads to an out-of-bounds index error when trying to access the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments are present before attempting to access their indexes in the command. Additionally, it should handle cases where the suggestion for the upstream branch is not found in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('push') + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # Remove the argument following push
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('push') + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # Remove the argument following push

    # Get the suggested upstream branch
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code includes checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and handles the logic accordingly. It also addresses potential out-of-bounds errors by ensuring that the index operations are performed only if the necessary parts are found in the command.
