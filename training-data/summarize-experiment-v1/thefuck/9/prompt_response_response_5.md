The issue highlighted a problem with the suggestions for `git push -u myfork` after the implementation of issue #538. The error occurred when trying to push a branch to a remote branch and set it as the upstream. The suggested command was `hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier` instead of `git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp`, as it was before issue #538 was merged.

Analyzed repo: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_9/thefuck/rules/git_push.py`

Identified potential error location:
The potential error location is within the get_new_command function where the command.script_parts.pop() method is being used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command script parts.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the improper removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command script parts. This results in a wrong command being formed when trying to push to a remote branch.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the get_new_command function needs to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their following arguments from the command script parts.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
