## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_9/thefuck/rules/git_push.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Error message:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for length 5
        at TestCode.main(TestCode.java:7)
```

Analysis:
- The error message indicates that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurred in the "main" thread.
- The index 5 was accessed in an array of length 5, causing the out of bounds error.

Buggy source code:
```java
public class TestCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(arr[5]);
    }
}
```

Identified stack frames:
- The error occurred at line 7 of the TestCode.java file.

Simplified error message:
```
Error: Index 5 out of bounds for length 5
```


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug in the obscure_transform function lies in the enumeration of the reversed string. The function's logic correctly alternates between converting characters to upper and lower case, but it does so based on the index of the characters in the reversed string. As a result, the original positions of the characters in the input string are not being properly reflected in the output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to reverse the input string before applying the character transformation. This ensures that the alternating uppercase and lowercase conversion is applied correctly based on the original positions of the characters.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    result = ""
    reversed_text = text[::-1]  # reverse the input string
    for i, char in enumerate(reversed_text):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result
```


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

# The fixed source code 
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 1: 
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```

# A GitHub issue for this bug

#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```
