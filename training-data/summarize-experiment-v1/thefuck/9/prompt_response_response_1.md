The potential error in the buggy function is in trying to access the last element of the command.stderr list without checking if it exists. This can lead to an IndexError if the list is empty.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function is attempting to access the last element of a list without first checking if the list is empty.
(b) The failing test demonstrates that the buggy function is trying to access non-existent elements when the array is already at its bounds.
(c) The corresponding error message indicates that the index 5 is out of bounds for an array of length 5.
(d) The actual input/output variable values are not available.
(e) The expected input/output variable values are not available.
(f) The GitHub Issue information is not directly provided.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the command.stderr list is empty before attempting to access its elements.
2. Handle the case where the command.stderr list is empty and provide a meaningful response or default value.

Corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if command.stderr:
            push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        else:
            push_upstream = ''
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for the presence of elements in command.stderr before trying to access it. Additionally, we handle the case when command.stderr is empty by providing a default value for push_upstream. This should help prevent any IndexErrors or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions.
