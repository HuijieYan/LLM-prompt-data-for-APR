The error seems to occur in the get_new_command function, within the try-except block that checks for the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command. If the '-u' option is present, it erroneously removes it and its argument twice, causing an out of bounds error.

To fix the bug, it should only remove the '-u' option and its argument once if it is identified. Additionally, the push_upstream variable should be obtained from the correct location to avoid errors.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]  # Corrected index
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
