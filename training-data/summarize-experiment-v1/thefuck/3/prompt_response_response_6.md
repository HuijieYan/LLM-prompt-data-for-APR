The potential error location lies in the `info` function, specifically in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the retrieving of the Fish shell version and processing the output.

The bug's cause is that when the `info` function is invoked, it attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the function does not properly capture and process the output from the command, leading to unexpected behavior.

The failing test and corresponding error message are not provided, so further analysis is not possible in this regard.

One potential approach for fixing the bug is to use `communicate()` after the `Popen` call to allow the `Popen` object to interact with the shell command and retrieve the output properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix should address the issue by properly retrieving and decoding the output from the command, ensuring that the correct version of the Fish shell is obtained and returned in the expected format.
