Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for the specific line or code where the error occurred. This will help identify the source of the issue and any relevant stack frames or messages.

Next, review the test code that led to the error. Check for any inputs or conditions that could have caused the error to occur.

Once the error location and test code have been identified, review the buggy source code to understand the context and potential causes of the error. Look for any obvious mistakes or issues in the code that could be causing the error.

After analyzing the error message, test code, and buggy source code, you can simplify the original error message by summarizing the key details and identifying the root cause of the issue.

For example, if the original error message was:

"Error: IndexOutOfBounds - array index out of range at line 23 in file Main.java"

You could simplify it to:

"Array index out of range error at line 23 in Main.java"
