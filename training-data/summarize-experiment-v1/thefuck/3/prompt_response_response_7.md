The identified bug in the `info` function from the `fish.py` file involves the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and the handling of the output. The current implementation may be causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used in Oh-My-Fish with the TheFuck plugin. 

The potential cause of the issue is the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` that is triggering recursive behavior, leading to a hang during the initialization. The bug could be resolved by directly retrieving the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to retrieve the Fish shell version in a way that does not cause recursive behavior. Here's a corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
from ..utils import DEVNULL
from subprocess import run, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = run(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
    version = proc.stdout.strip()
    return u'Fish Shell ' + version
```

This implementation fetches the Fish shell version directly using the '--version' flag with the `fish` command. With this fix, the `info` function should correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.

Additionally, by using the `run` function with the `text` argument set to true, the output from the command is handled as a string without the need for manual decoding. This approach ensures a more straightforward and reliable retrieval of the Fish shell version.

This correction should address the issue posted on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
