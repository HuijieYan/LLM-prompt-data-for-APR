`proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`: This line is likely calling the Fish shell to retrieve the version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

`version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`: This line is likely capturing the output from the previous command and converting it to a string, then stripping any trailing whitespace.

The `info` function: This function appears to be attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and formatting it as a string with the prefix "Fish Shell". It seems to have a bug related to the handling of the shell command output.
