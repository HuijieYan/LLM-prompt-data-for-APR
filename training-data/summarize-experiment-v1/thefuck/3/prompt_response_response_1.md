To address this bug, the issue concerns the `thefuck -v` command causing recursive looping within the Fish Shell's `info` method. The specific problem exists in the `shells/fish.py` file within the `thefuck` plugin. The `info` method in the `Fish` class appears to be trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell but is not handling the shell command output correctly.

To resolve this issue, a fix is needed that involves effectively handling the command output in the `info` method. A potential solution may involve modifying how the command output is captured and processed to prevent recursive looping when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

The corrected code for the `info` method is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.stdout.close()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this fixed version of the `info` method, after capturing the output from the shell command, it's important to close the `proc.stdout` stream to prevent blocking and clean up resources properly. This updated code should resolve the recursive looping issue caused by the `thefuck -v` command.

Once implemented, the corrected code should pass the failing test and address the issue described in the GitHub post.
