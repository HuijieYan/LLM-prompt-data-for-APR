The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is likely related to the way it retrieves and processes the version of the Fish shell. The specific details of the bug and the error message are not provided, but it seems that the function is not handling the command output correctly.

The correct approach to fixing this bug would be to use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to capture the output and error streams and properly close the process after retrieving the version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # Capturing both stdout and stderr streams
    output, _ = proc.communicate()  # Getting output and ignoring the error stream
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve and process the version of the Fish shell, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
