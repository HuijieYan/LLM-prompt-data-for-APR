The bug in the `info` function would show the Fish shell version by calling `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The error likely stems from how the function is processing the output of the shell command.

The test case and error message are not provided, so a specific fix cannot be determined. However, the bug's cause is identified in the handling of the shell command output.

The initial bug is likely caused by mishandling the shell command's output within the function. The actual input/output variable values cannot be assessed without the test case, and similarly, the expected input/output variable values are unknown.

To resolve the bug, the `info` function should read the output from the `Popen` command and handle it appropriately. This could involve altering the way the shell output is read and processed.

Here's a corrected version of the `info` function that should address the bug:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This fix improves the way the shell command's output is captured and processed. It should resolve the issue with the Fish shell version hanging during initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used.
