The bug in the `info` function of the Fish class of the `thefuck` repository occurs because the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line is capturing the output from the command to retrieve the Fish shell version and converting it to a string, then stripping any trailing whitespace. However, this process might lead to an infinite loop due to recursive call which is causing the `thefuck -v` command to hang in the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

One way to correct this bug is to check for the existence of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable before attempting to retrieve the version. If the environment variable is not present, a message indicating the unavailability of the variable should be returned instead of initiating the recursive loop during initialization.

Here's a corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'FISH_VERSION' in os.environ:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return u'Fish Shell version not available'
```

In this corrected version, we first check for the existence of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable before attempting to retrieve the version. If the variable is not present, a message indicating that the version is not available is returned. This should help resolve the recursive loop issue causing the `thefuck -v` command to hang.
