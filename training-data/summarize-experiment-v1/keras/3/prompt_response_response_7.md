The bug in the provided _clone_functional_model has been identified as potentially causing the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error. This is based on the failing test case and the information from the GitHub issue.

The potential error location in the provided function is in the section where the output_tensors are being assembled. The error message suggests that the error occurs when the output_tensors are being computed, and the failing test case from the GitHub issue seems to support this.

The bug's cause is likely related to the handling of layers with multiple outputs and the computation of masks in the provided function. This may lead to the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error. The failing test case from the GitHub issue also involves a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support, which aligns with the potential bug in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to address the computation of masks for layers with multiple outputs, especially for layers without mask support, to prevent the mentioned error. Additionally, the function should handle input_tensors and input_layers in a consistent and clear manner to avoid potential issues.

Here is the corrected version of the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same function signature and initial sections)

    # Create a dictionary to store references to the cloned layers.
    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    # Check if input_tensors is provided, if not, create placeholders for building the model.
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) 
                         for layer in model._input_layers]
        # Map the original input layers to the newly created placeholders.
        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[original] = cloned
    else:
        # Handle input_tensors to ensure they come from a Keras layer, handling InputLayer separately.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_layer = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_layer)
                # Map the original input layer and the newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_layer._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over the nodes in the reference model.
    for depth in reversed(range(len(model._nodes_by_depth))):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create cloned layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs for the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check and compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the computation of masks for layers with multiple outputs and prevent the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error. This aligns with the issue reported on GitHub and would resolve the problem described in the failing test case.
