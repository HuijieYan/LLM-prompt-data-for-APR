The potential error location within the buggy function could be the for loop on line 157, where it iterates through the reference output tensors and computes the masks for each layer. The issue might arise from the layer.compute_mask() method returning None since the Lambda layer does not support using masks.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
(a) The buggy function is trying to build a new model by cloning an existing model with some specified inputs.
(b) The failing test indicates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which leads to an inference that the error could be related to accessing elements beyond the index range.
(c) The error message "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 10 out of bounds for length 10" suggests that the bug occurs when the program tries to access an element at index 10 in an array with a length of 10.
(d) This information should be compared against the corresponding input/output variable values to determine the state of the program when the error occurs.
(e) The GitHub issue provides a related context wherein a bug is reported when using clone_model() with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True. The issue is associated with an 'AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor' when a Lambda layer without mask support is included in the functional model.

To fix the bug, a potential approach would be to modify the way the masks are computed for layers that do not support masks, such as the Lambda layer. Additionally, checking for the presence of masks before attempting to compute masks may help handle layers that do not support masks.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function considering the potential approach for fixing the bug:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    for node in nodes:
        # Recover the corresponding layer.
        layer = node.outbound_layer

        # Get or create layer.
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            layer = new_layer
        else:
            # Reuse previously cloned layer.
            layer = layer_map[layer]
            # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                continue

        # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
        reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
        reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

        # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
        # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
        computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            if len(computed_data) == 1:
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and computed_mask:  # Check if the layer supports masks
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                if computed_mask:  # Update output masks only if computed mask is available
                    output_masks = to_list(
                        layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor,
                                           computed_mask))
                else:
                    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)
            else:
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and all(computed_masks):  # Check if the layer supports masks for all input tensors
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                # Update output masks only if computed masks are available
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors,
                                       computed_masks)) if all(computed_masks) else [None] * len(output_tensors)
            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors,
                                  output_tensors,
                                  output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the computation of masks for layers that do not support masks, such as the Lambda layer mentioned in the GitHub issue, and should resolve the reported bug.
