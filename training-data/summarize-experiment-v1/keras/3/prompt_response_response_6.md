The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is likely related to the mismatch between the input_tensors and input_layers. The code seems to be creating new input layers and input tensors, but there might be an issue in correctly mapping the original input layers to the newly created ones.

The problem could be arising from the `input_tensors` and `_input_tensors` lists, and how the mapping between the original input layers and newly created input layers is handled.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the input_tensors and input_layers are correctly mapped by iterating through both lists simultaneously.
2. Validate that the original input layers and input tensors are being properly cached in the `layer_map` dictionary.
3. Double-check the logic for creating new input layers and ensure that the mapping to the original input layers is correct.
4. Verify that the `tensor_map` is correctly updated with the newly created input tensors and their corresponding original input tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing function code)

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            input_layers.append(layer)  # Store the original input layers
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
            layer_map[original] = cloned  # Map the original input layers to the cloned ones
    else:
        # ... (existing logic for mapping input tensors)

    # ... (remaining function code)
``` 

With this correction, the function should properly handle the cloning of functional models and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
