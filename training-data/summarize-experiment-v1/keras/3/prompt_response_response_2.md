## Correction to the Buggy Function

The potential error location in the buggy function is within the enumeration of the nodes in the reference model. This enumeration is responsible for creating new layers and mapping new input tensors to the original input tensors. However, the current implementation may not correctly handle cases where input tensors come from a Keras layer or when all previous input tensors are available in the tensor map.

The bug's cause is that the code is not properly handling input tensors that come from a Keras layer. Additionally, there are potential issues with the creation and mapping of input tensors.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for and handle cases where input tensors come from a Keras layer.
2. Carefully create and map input tensors to ensure that they are correctly indexed and matched.

Here is the corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            input_layers.append(newly_created_input_layer)
        model._input_layers = input_layers
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not hasattr(x, '._keras_history'):
                name = 'input_' + str(i)
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name=name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[input_tensors[i]] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    # ... (existing code)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
With this correction, the function should appropriately handle the creation and mapping of input tensors, ensuring that the model can be reproduced correctly on top of new input tensors.
