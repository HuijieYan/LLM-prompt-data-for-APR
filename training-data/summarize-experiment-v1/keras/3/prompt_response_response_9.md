The potential location of the error in the code lies in the section where the output_tensors and output_masks are being computed within the loop that iterates through the nodes in the reference model.

The bug's cause is that the output_masks will always be [None], and the error is raised when the model is trying to compute the output tensors.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle cases where the layer.compute_mask(...) returns None, and consistently assign the output masks based on the result of this computation.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # (existing code...)
            
            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            if len(computed_data) == 1:
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and computed_mask is not None:  # Check if computed_mask is not None
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor, computed_mask))
                computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                computed_masks = [computed_mask]
            else:
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and all(mask is not None for mask in computed_masks):  # Check if all computed_masks are not None
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

            # (existing code...)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the function will appropriately handle the cases where the layer.compute_mask(...) returns None, ensuring that the output masks are assigned based on the result of this computation. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
