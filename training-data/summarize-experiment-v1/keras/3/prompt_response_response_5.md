The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function inside the `keras.models` module of the Keras library is causing the issue reported in the GitHub thread. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" is being raised when using `clone_model()`, specifically when using `multi_gpu_model` with the `cpu_relocation=True` parameter.

The failing test scenario is not provided, but the issue mentions that the error is occurring with the mentioned script that is intended to raise an AssertionError: "Could not compute output Tensor".

The failing test is related to the environment setup with the specific versions of Keras and TensorFlow, and using multi-GPU setups.

The actual input is not explicitly mentioned, but the error message and the code snippets from the GitHub issue indicate that it is related to creating a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support.

To fix the bug, the `_clone_functional_model` function should be modified to handle the case where a layer has multiple outputs without mask support and update the output_masks accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function that addresses the mentioned issue and will resolve the problem reported on GitHub:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... existing code ...
    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if mask is None:
            # If mask is None, create a mask placeholder
            mask = Input(shape=y.shape[1:], name=x.name.split('/')[0] + '_mask')
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
    # ... existing code ...
```

With this correction, the `_clone_functional_model` function will handle the case where a layer has multiple outputs without mask support and create a placeholder mask if needed. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
