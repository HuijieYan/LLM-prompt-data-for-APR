The buggy function is complete and functional, but it doesn't appear to be the same as the function mentioned in the prompt. The function provided in the prompt is supposed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images according to a specific data format and mode.

The expected input for this function is:
- x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
- data_format: Data format of the image array.
- mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".

The expected output is:
- Preprocessed Numpy array.

The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` appears to be related to the processing of the input array based on the specified mode. The function doesn't handle the different modes correctly, leading to potential errors or incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and data format. This could involve revising the handling of the input array and applying the appropriate preprocessing steps based on the mode parameter.

Here's a corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles the different modes and applies the appropriate preprocessing steps based on the mode and data format parameters. It also ensures that the input array is preprocessed correctly before being returned as the output.
