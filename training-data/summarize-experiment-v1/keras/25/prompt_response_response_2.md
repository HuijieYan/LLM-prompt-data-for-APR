The buggy function appears to be using a series of conditional statements to preprocess Numpy arrays of images based on different modes ("caffe", "tf", or "torch"). There is an error location at line 15, where the x variable is divided by 127.5 and then subtracted by 1 for the 'tf' mode, but without checking if the array has the right dimensions.

The bug's cause is rooted in the conditional statements for the 'tf' mode. The function should appropriately handle the dimensions of the input Numpy array when applying the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' mode. The failing test case is related to an image array with the 'tf' mode, causing an "Exception in thread" error due to an out-of-bounds index when trying to access the array.

To address this issue, the function should modify the conditional preprocessing steps for the 'tf' mode to correctly handle the dimensions of the input array. Specifically, when the input array is 3D, the function should divide by 127.5 and subtract 1 for each channel. When the input array is 4D, the function should divide by 127.5 and subtract 1 for each sample in the batch.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' mode based on the dimensions of the input Numpy array, addressing the out-of-bounds index error for the failing test cases.
