## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/luigi_28/luigi/contrib/hive.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: The `HiveCommandClient` class uses `hive` invocations to find information.

`def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True)`: This function is called within the `table_exists` function to execute a Hive command and check the return code.

`def partition_spec(self, partition)`: This function is also called within the `table_exists` function to format the partition specification before running the Hive command.

`def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None)`: This function checks whether a table exists in a given database. It calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and uses `partition_spec` to format partition specifications, depending on whether a partition is provided as an argument or not.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Error message:
"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 10 out of bounds for length 10
    at TestCode.main(TestCode.java:8)"

In this error message, it is indicating that there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurring in the "main" thread of the Java program at line 8 in the TestCode.java file. The error is stating that the index 10 is out of bounds for an array of length 10, which means the program is trying to access an element at an index that does not exist in the array.

The stack frames closely related to the fault location are at the main method in the TestCode.java file.

Simplified error message:
"Array index 10 is out of bounds for length 10 in TestCode.java at line 8."


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug in the obscure_transform function lies in the enumeration of the reversed string. The function's logic correctly alternates between converting characters to uppercase and lowercase, but using enumerate with reversed does not yield the expected result. This is because the enumeration assigns indices to characters based on their original order, not their reversed order.

To fix this bug, we can simply reverse the string before the loop and then iterate over it without using enumerate. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    reversed_text = text[::-1]  # Reverse the input string
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(reversed_text):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result
```

With this fix, the function should correctly apply the desired transformation to the input string and produce the expected output for all test cases.

# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
