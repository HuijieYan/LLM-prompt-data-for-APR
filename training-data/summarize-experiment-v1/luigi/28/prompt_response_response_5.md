The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that the function does not account for case insensitivity when checking whether a table exists in a given database. The issue was identified from a GitHub issue titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive", which suggested that the function should check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

To resolve the bug:
1. The table name should be converted to lowercase using the `table.lower()` function before comparing it with the `stdout` variable.
2. This will account for case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table in the database.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
