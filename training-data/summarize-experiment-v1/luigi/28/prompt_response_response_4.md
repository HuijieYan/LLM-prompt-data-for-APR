The bug in the provided code is that the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. This is identified as a bug in a GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" and "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". The program does not pass the failing test for a case-insensitive table name, returning a False negative.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the code to convert the `table` variable to lowercase before checking it with the `stdout` variable. This will make the check case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner, which would satisfy the GitHub issue and allow the program to pass the failing test.
