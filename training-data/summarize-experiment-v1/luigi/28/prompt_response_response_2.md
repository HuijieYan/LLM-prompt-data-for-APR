The issue in the `table_exists` function arises from a mismatch in the case sensitivity of table names between the `HiveCommandClient` class and the Hive table names. The function compares the table name with the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`, resulting in case sensitivity issues. This error causes the table existence check to fail as it doesn't accurately match the table names.

Based on the data provided, the following suggests a fix:

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Adjust the comparison to ensure case insensitivity by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
