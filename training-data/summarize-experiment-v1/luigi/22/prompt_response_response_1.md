The provided source code does not match the scenario and the description of the buggy function provided earlier. It appears to be a different function altogether. 

To fix the original buggy function, there are a few possible approaches:

1. Check how the `last_active` parameter is being used and ensure that it is consistent with how time is being handled in the class.
2. Review the usage of the `tasks` and `info` attributes within the class to ensure they are being updated and utilized correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the original buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is now assigned the current time using `time.time()` if it is None, ensuring that it always contains a valid value. This fix addresses the potential issue with the `last_active` parameter.
