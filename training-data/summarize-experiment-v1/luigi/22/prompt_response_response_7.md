The provided source code does not match the scenario described in the initial problem statement. Therefore, I will provide a corrected version of the "scheduler" class's "__init__" method based on the problem description.

The buggy "__init__" function initializes the Worker object with attributes such as worker_id, last_active, reference, started, tasks, and info. It is likely responsible for setting up the initial state of the Worker object.

Based on the provided code, the "__init__" function seems to be structuring a class named "Worker" for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The "last_active" parameter is set to default value None, and the function initializes attributes such as worker_id, reference, last_active, started, tasks, and info.

However, from the information provided, it seems that there might not be a bug in the given function. It initializes the Worker object with the specified attributes, and there are no obvious errors or issues within the function itself.

Considering the possibility that the bug might be outside the function, it would be important to thoroughly review the usage of the "Worker" class in the codebase, particularly where the "last_active" and "time" module are being utilized, as well as how the "tasks" and "info" attributes are being used inside the class.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no bug in the given function, and it appears to be correctly initializing the Worker object as intended.

If there are specific issues with how the "Worker" class is being used elsewhere in the code, it would be necessary to review that code and potentially make changes or adjustments as needed.

However, for the provided function, here is the original corrected code for the "__init__" function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Based on the information provided, this corrected code initializes the Worker object with the specified attributes without any obvious issues.
