The given code appears to be for the `__init__` method of a class, setting up the initial state of a Worker object. The potential bug location may lie in the usage of the `last_active` and `time` module, or in how the `tasks` and `info` attributes are utilized within the class.

The error message provided does not seem relevant to the given code, and there are no actual input/output variable values given. 

However, based on the given code, the bug seems to be that the `last_active` parameter is intended to be set with the current time if no value is provided, but this functionality is not implemented correctly. The use of `time.time()` appears to be intended to capture the start time of the worker, rather than setting the `last_active` attribute directly. 

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be checked for a value, and if no value is provided, it should be set to the current time using `time.time()`. The corrected code for the `__init__` method could be:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will be correctly set to the current time if no value is provided. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and pass the test cases.
