The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments, specifically for the key-value pairs in a dictionary. However, there seems to be an issue with the construction of the command.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the construction of the `command` list, especially the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line seems to be adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs, which may be causing issues with the command.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list, possibly due to the unnecessary quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the construction of the `command` list to properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly construct the command for Spark job submission based on the input dictionary, and the failing test should pass.
