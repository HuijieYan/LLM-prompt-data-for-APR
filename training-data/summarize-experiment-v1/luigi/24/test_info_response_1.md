Error message:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for length 5
        at TestCode.main(TestCode.java:7)
```

Analysis:
- The error message is indicating an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, meaning that the code is trying to access an index in an array that is out of bounds.
- The error occurred in the `main` method of the `TestCode` class at line 7 in the file `TestCode.java`.

Buggy source code:
```java
public class TestCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[5];
        numbers[5] = 10;
    }
}
```

In this example, the problem is with the line `numbers[5] = 10;`, where the index `5` is out of bounds for the array `numbers` with a length of `5`.

Simplified error message:
```
Index 5 out of bounds for length 5 in TestCode.java:7
```
