The fixed source code for the buggy function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
    return command
```

In the fixed code:
1. We modified the variable name from `value` to `val` inside the for loop to avoid conflicting with the parameter name.
2. The value and reference to `value` inside the for loop was also fixed.

This should address the issue with constructing the command based on the dictionary items and will pass the failing test.
