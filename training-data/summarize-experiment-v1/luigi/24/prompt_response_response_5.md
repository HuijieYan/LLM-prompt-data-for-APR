The buggy function is "_dict_arg" from the SparkSubmitTask class in the file `spark.py`. This function is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments.

The _dict_arg function takes `name` and `value` as parameters and constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary when the value is a dictionary.

The error message suggests that the code is trying to access an index in an array that is out of bounds, indicating a potential issue with array indexing in the code.

Looking at the code of _dict_arg, it seems that the `command` list is being appended with a name-value pair using incorrect string formatting. This could potentially result in an array index out of bounds error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the string formatting for `name` and `value` in the command list is correct and does not lead to an array index out of bounds error.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this fixed code, the string formatting for `prop` and `val` ensures that the correct name-value pairs from the dictionary are added to the `command` list. This should resolve the array index out of bounds error and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
