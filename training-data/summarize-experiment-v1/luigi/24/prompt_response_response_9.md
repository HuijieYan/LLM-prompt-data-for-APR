The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value` as parameters and is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments. The function checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The bug occurs in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where the values are being appended, but the formatting of the dictionary key-value pair is incorrect.

The error message from the failing test is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, indicating that the code is trying to access an index in an array that is out of bounds.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the command construction to properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

The corrected code for the buggy function `_dict_arg` is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name from "value" to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, "'{0}={1}'".format(prop, val)]  # Correct the formatting of the key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this fix, the function correctly constructs the command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and the failing tests should now pass.
