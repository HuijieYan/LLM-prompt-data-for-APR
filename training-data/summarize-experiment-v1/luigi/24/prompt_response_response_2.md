The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it's constructing the command based on the input dictionary but not handling the properties properly. It seems to be appending the property name and value within quotes incorrectly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of adding double quotes around the property and value, construct the command without quotes.
2. Check if the value is not empty before processing it.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should correctly construct the command based on the input dictionary, fixing the bug.

Please note that I had to make an assumption about how the command is constructed based on the available information. If there are specific requirements for how the command should be formatted, those should be reflected in the corrected code.
