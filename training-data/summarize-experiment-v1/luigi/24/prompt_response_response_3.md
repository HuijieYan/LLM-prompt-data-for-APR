The buggy function `_dict_arg` has a potential error in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The `command` list is being concatenated with a list, which may not produce the intended result.

The bug's cause:
(a) The `_dict_arg` function takes `name` and `value` as parameters and is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The issue is with the construction of the command by concatenating the `command` list with a list, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
(b) The related function `name(self)` is not directly relevant to the bug.
(c) The failing test case does not apply directly to this code, so the relevant input/output variable values are not available.
(d) N/A
(e) N/A
(f) N/A
(g) N/A

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of concatenating a list, use the `append` method to add elements to the `command` list.
2. Reconstruct the command construction logic to ensure the correct formation of the command.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this fix, the `_dict_arg` function now correctly constructs the command based on the input arguments, and should work as expected.
