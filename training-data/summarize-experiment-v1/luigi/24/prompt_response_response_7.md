The buggy function appears to be `_dict_arg`, which is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `spark.py` file. The function is designed to construct a command for Spark job submission based on input arguments.

The potential error in the function is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the command is being constructed. It is possible that the construction of the `command` list is not being done correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect construction of the command list. Due to the improper formatting of the command list, it seems that the resulting command is not being generated as expected, leading to potential errors during Spark job submission.

To fix the bug, the construction of the 'command' list needs to be revisited. One potential approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the command list is being built correctly from the input parameters and that the formatting of individual elements is done accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

In this corrected code, the `command` list is constructed using the `append` method to ensure that the elements are added correctly, and the string formatting is adjusted to provide the desired output. This should address the issues with the construction of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.
