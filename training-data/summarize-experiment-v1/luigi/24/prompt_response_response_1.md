The buggy function `_dict_arg` is from the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is used for running Spark jobs on various environments. The `_dict_arg` function takes `name` and `value` as parameters and is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments.

The bug is likely occurring in the construction of the `command` list. The function checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then attempts to construct a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The error message indicates an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at a particular index, suggesting that the constructed `command` list is somehow causing this issue. 

The suggestion for fixing this bug involves reversing the string before applying the enumeration so that the transformation is based on the original index of the characters in the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected code, the variable inside the loop has been changed from `value` to `val` to avoid conflict with the outer `value` parameter. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function constructs the `command` list correctly based on the input dictionary.
