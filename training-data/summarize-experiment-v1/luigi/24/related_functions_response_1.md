Class docstring: The `SparkSubmitTask` class is a template for running a Spark job and supports running jobs on various Spark environments.

`def name(self)`: This function is from the same file but is not the same class, and it is called by the buggy function. The details of this function are not relevant to our focus.

`def _dict_arg(self, name, value) -> None`: This is the buggy function that needs fixing. It takes `name` and `value` as parameters and is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments. The function checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. There seems to be an issue in the construction of the command.
