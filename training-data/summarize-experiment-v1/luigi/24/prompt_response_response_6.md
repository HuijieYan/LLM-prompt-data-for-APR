The buggy function is `_dict_arg` and it is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class. It takes `name` and `value` as parameters and is used to construct a command for Spark job submission based on the input arguments. The function checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The error message states that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurred in the `main` method at line 7 of the `TestCode` class, indicating that the code is trying to access an index in an array that is out of bounds.

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to how the command is constructed based on the input dictionary. The construction of the command could be causing index out of bounds errors, similar to the error message described.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command construction based on the input dictionary is done correctly without causing any out of bounds errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid overwriting 'value'
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))  # Modify the way the command is constructed
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should construct the command correctly based on the input dictionary, ensuring that it doesn't cause any out of bounds errors.
