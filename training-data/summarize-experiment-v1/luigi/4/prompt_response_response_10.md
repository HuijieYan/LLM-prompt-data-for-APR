The bug in the `copy` function appears to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. The issue on GitHub mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails due to a TypeError. This is likely related to the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function.

The `copy` function is responsible for defining the copying from S3 into Redshift. It relies on credentials and copy options to execute the data transfer. The bug in the function may be related to the incorrect handling or usage of these related functions, specifically the `self.columns` attribute.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to properly handle cases where `self.columns` is None. This change would prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None and also ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not None.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By making this change, the program should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
