`def _credentials(self)`: This function is likely responsible for handling credentials or authentication for accessing the data source.

`def copy_options(self)`: This function probably handles the options for the copy operation, such as file format, delimiter, or other settings for the data transfer.

Class docstring: The class `S3CopyToTable` is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3. It requires certain attributes to be overridden and provides the option to override attributes from `CredentialsMixin`.

`def copy(self, cursor, f)`: This function defines the copying from S3 into Redshift. It utilizes `self._credentials()` to fetch credentials and `self.copy_options` to handle copy options for the operation.

The interactions between the `copy` function and the related functions `self._credentials()` and `self.copy_options` indicate that the `copy` function relies on credentials and copy options to execute the data transfer. The issue with the `copy` function may be related to the incorrect handling or usage of these related functions.
