The bug in the copy function is likely related to the handling of the self.columns attribute. The error suggests that there is an issue with the len() function being called on a NoneType object, indicating that self.columns may not be properly initialized or defined. This issue may be related to changes made in a recent pull request, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the if statement checking the length of self.columns should be modified to ensure that it is not None before attempting to get its length. This can be done by changing the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.

Below is the corrected code for the copy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the program should pass the failing test and resolve the issue identified in the GitHub report.
