## The corrected code for the buggy function

The corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length. This ensures that the program does not encounter a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and resolves the identified bug.
