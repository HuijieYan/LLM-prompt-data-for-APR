The bug in the provided `copy` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`. The issue has been posted on GitHub, and a potential solution has also been suggested.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to determine its length. We can modify the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
