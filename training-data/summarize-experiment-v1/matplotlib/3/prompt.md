## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/matplotlib_3/lib/matplotlib/markers.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data visualization. 

`def _recache(self)`: This function appears to reset several attributes and then call another function `_marker_function`. It is likely responsible for recalculating and updating the marker style based on the new attributes.

`self._marker_function()`: This function is being called at the end of `_recache`, and it is assumed to be responsible for updating the marker based on the new attributes that were reset.

Understanding the interactions and dependencies of these functions within the `MarkerStyle` class can provide insights into why `self._marker_function` may not be functioning as expected.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for specific details such as the command line input, the test code that triggered the error, and the source code where the bug may be located. 

Identify the stack frames or messages that are closely related to the fault location. This can include any lines of code, specific functions, or modules that are referenced in the error message. 

Simplify the original error message by breaking it down into its essential components. This may involve removing extraneous information and focusing on the key details of the error, such as the type of error (e.g. syntax error, runtime error, etc.), the specific line of code or function causing the error, and any relevant error codes or messages.

Once you have simplified the error message, you can use this information to help pinpoint the exact location of the issue in the code and begin debugging the problem.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The bug in the function is caused by the fact that the index used to check for odd or even positions is based on the reversed string. This means that for the original input, the function is actually applying the transformation based on the characters in their original positions, rather than in the reversed string.

To fix this bug, we need to reverse the text before entering the for loop and then apply the transformation based on the reversed string. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def obscure_transform(text):
    reversed_text = text[::-1]  # Reverse the input text
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(reversed_text):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()
    return result
```

With this fix, the function should correctly apply the transformation based on the reversed text and produce the expected output for both test cases.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

# The fixed source code 
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 1: 
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
The markers are not hollow when I use ax.scatter() and set markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. My usage is wrong?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a costomed markers.MarkerStyle and set the paramter fillstyle='none'. But I don't get what I want.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np
xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
