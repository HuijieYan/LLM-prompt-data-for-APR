# The fixed source code with corrected function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if marker function exists
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Marker function is not defined")
```

By adding a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` exists before executing it, we can prevent any potential issues related to the function not being defined. This will help avoid errors related to unexpected function calls when `self._marker_function` is not set.

Please note that the GitHub issue has not been fully resolved due to the complexity of the problem and potential underlying causes, but this fix can help address one of the potential reasons for the reported behavior.
