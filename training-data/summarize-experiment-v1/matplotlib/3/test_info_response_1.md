Without the error message, it is difficult for me to analyze the specific details of the issue, but I can provide a general approach to analyzing an error message.

When analyzing an error message, start by looking for specific details such as the command line input, the test code that triggered the error, and the source code where the bug may be located. 

Identify the stack frames or messages that are closely related to the fault location. This can include any lines of code, specific functions, or modules that are referenced in the error message. 

Simplify the original error message by breaking it down into its essential components. This may involve removing extraneous information and focusing on the key details of the error, such as the type of error (e.g. syntax error, runtime error, etc.), the specific line of code or function causing the error, and any relevant error codes or messages.

Once you have simplified the error message, you can use this information to help pinpoint the exact location of the issue in the code and begin debugging the problem.
