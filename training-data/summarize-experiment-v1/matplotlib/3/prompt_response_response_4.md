The buggy function seems to be the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib` library. The purpose of this function is to reset several attributes and then call the `_marker_function` to recalculate and update the marker style based on the new attributes.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the call to `self._marker_function()` at the end of the function. It seems that this call is not achieving the desired marker style update, which could be causing the issue reported on GitHub.

The bug's cause may be due to the `_marker_function` not correctly updating the marker style based on the new attributes set within the `_recache` function. This is indicated by the reported issue on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce hollow markers as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` or its associated logic needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it appropriately updates the marker style based on the attributes reset within the `_recache` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected code, the `if` statement checks if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This ensures that the marker function is only called when it exists, preventing any potential errors if the marker function is not defined.

By making this change, the `MarkerStyle` class should correctly update and recache the marker style based on the attributes set within the `_recache` function, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
