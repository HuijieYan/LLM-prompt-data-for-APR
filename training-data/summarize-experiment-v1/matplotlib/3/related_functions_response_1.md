Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data visualization. 

`def _recache(self)`: This function appears to reset several attributes and then call another function `_marker_function`. It is likely responsible for recalculating and updating the marker style based on the new attributes.

`self._marker_function()`: This function is being called at the end of `_recache`, and it is assumed to be responsible for updating the marker based on the new attributes that were reset.

Understanding the interactions and dependencies of these functions within the `MarkerStyle` class can provide insights into why `self._marker_function` may not be functioning as expected.
