The bug is likely located in the code for the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class in the file `markers.py`.

The bug's probable cause is that the `_marker_function` is not initializing the marker correctly, resulting in unexpected marker styles when scatter plots are generated using `fillstyle='none'`.

Given that the MarkerStyle class affects the appearance of markers in a scatter plot, the bug may be due to an issue in the way the marker styles are updated and applied.


A potential approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly updates the marker style based on the specified fillstyle. This may involve checking how the `fillstyle` parameter is handled within the marker function and ensuring that it properly sets markers to 'hollow' when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.


The corrected code could involve modifying the way the `_recache` function interacts with the `_marker_function`, ensuring that the marker styles are correctly updated and maintained. Here is a potential correct code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self.set_marker('_')
    self._marker_function()
```
