The bug is likely related to the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. The method appears to be resetting several attributes and then calling the `_marker_function`. However, if `self._marker_function` is not intended to be called at this point or if it requires specific setup that is not being provided, it may be causing unexpected behavior.

The expected input/output variable information for this method is not provided, so it's unclear how the method should behave. However, based on the provided context, it seems like the method is intended to reset attributes and then call another function to update the marker style based on the new attributes.

To fix the bug, we would need to understand the expected behavior of `_recache` and how it should interact with `_marker_function`. Based on the given information, we may need to modify the sequence of attribute resets or ensure that the proper setup is in place for `_marker_function` to execute correctly.

To address the GitHub issue, we may specifically need to focus on how the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is intended to interact with the marker style and ensure that the changes made in the `MarkerStyle` class align with the expected behavior for scatter plot markers.

Here's an updated version of the `_recache` method that addresses the potential issue:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    # Call _marker_function if it's necessary for recaching
    self._marker_function()
```

By ensuring that `_marker_function` is properly called based on the intended behavior, we can potentially resolve the issue related to marker styling for scatter plots.
