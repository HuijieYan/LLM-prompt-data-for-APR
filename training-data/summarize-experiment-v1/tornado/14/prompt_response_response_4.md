## Corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
- We first store the current instance of the IOLoop in the variable `current_instance`.
- Then we check if `make_current` is None, and if the current instance is None, we make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is True, we check if the current instance is not None, and if so, raise a RuntimeError.
- Finally, we make the current instance if `make_current` is True and the current instance is None.

This corrected code should address the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
