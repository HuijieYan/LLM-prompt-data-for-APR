Error message:
"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 10 out of bounds for length 10
    at TestCode.method(TestCode.java:8)
    at TestCode.main(TestCode.java:4)"

Test code:
```
public class TestCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = new int[10];
        method(arr);
    }
    
    public static void method(int[] arr) {
        arr[10] = 5;
    }
}
```

Buggy source code:
```
public static void method(int[] arr) {
    arr[10] = 5;
}
```

Analysis:
The error message shows that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurred in the method method() at line 8 of the TestCode.java file, which was called from the main method at line 4 of the same file. This error indicates that an attempt was made to access an array element at index 10, which is out of bounds for an array of length 10.

The stack frames closely related to the fault location are:
1. TestCode.method(TestCode.java:8) - This is the specific location where the exception occurred.
2. TestCode.main(TestCode.java:4) - This is the method from which the faulty method was called.

Simplified error message:
"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 10 out of bounds for length 10 in TestCode.method() method."
