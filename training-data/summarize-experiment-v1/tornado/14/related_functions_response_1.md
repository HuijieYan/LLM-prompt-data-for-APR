Class IOLoop docstring: This class represents a level-triggered I/O loop. It mentions using epoll (Linux) or kqueue (BSD and Mac OS X) if available, or falling back on select(). The class also includes example usage for a simple TCP server.

`def current(instance=True)`: This function, both at the module level and within the class, likely returns the current instance of the IOLoop.

`def make_current(self)`: This function within the class likely allows the current instance of the IOLoop to be set as the current instance.

`def initialize(self, make_current=None)`: This is the buggy function that is causing issues. It seems to be designed to initialize the IOLoop instance. It checks if the IOLoop is current, and if not, it tries to make it current based on the `make_current` argument. There seems to be a condition for raising a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists.
