# The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The correction involves storing the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable and then checking the variable in the conditional statements. This ensures that the current instance is only checked once and used multiple times as needed. This modification should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
