## Solution

The potential error location in the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `None`. This condition seems redundant because regardless of the value of `make_current`, the function still checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and then makes it the current instance.

The bug's cause is that the conditional statement checking if `make_current` is `None` is unnecessary and redundant.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement checking if `make_current` is `None` can be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current` and pass the failing test.
