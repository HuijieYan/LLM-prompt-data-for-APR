Potential error location within the buggy function:
The potential error location is in the "initialize" function at the "elif make_current" condition, where it seems to be checking if the current IOLoop instance is None and then raising a RuntimeError if it already exists. This logic seems to be conflicting, leading to the issue reported in the GitHub problem.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that the "initialize" function is not correctly handling the "make_current" argument, leading to conflicting conditions that result in the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "initialize" function correctly handles the "make_current" argument and checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make it current.

Here's the corrected code for the "initialize" function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrects the logic by capturing the current IOLoop instance before checking its existence and then using that captured value for the conditional checks. This should resolve the issue and make the "initialize" function work as intended.
