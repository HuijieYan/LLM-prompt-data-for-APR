The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises due to an incorrect check for the current instance of the `IOLoop`. The function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and check if it already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the current implementation does not handle the `make_current` argument properly and can lead to incorrect behavior.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` function's conditional statements that check for the current instance of the `IOLoop`. It seems that the condition for checking if the `IOLoop` is already current is not properly implemented, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and check for the current existence of the `IOLoop` instance before trying to make it current. Additionally, the logic for raising a `RuntimeError` if the current instance already exists should also be reviewed and corrected.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and the current existence of the `IOLoop` instance, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and ensuring the proper initialization of the `IOLoop` instance.
