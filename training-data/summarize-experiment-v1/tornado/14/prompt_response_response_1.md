Corrected code for the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current instance of the `IOLoop` in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we modify the conditions to check if the `current_instance` is `None` or not, and take the appropriate actions. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
