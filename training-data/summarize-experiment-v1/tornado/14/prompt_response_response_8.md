Approach for fixing the bug:
1. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistent checking of the `make_current` argument and the current instance of IOLoop.
2. The bug might be in the condition where it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists.
3. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and handling the `make_current` argument is consistent.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `make_current` argument and checking the current instance of IOLoop consistently, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
