1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is a method in the "Parser" class within the pandas/io/json/_json.py file. It seems that this function is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray into a date column. The bug seems to be related to attempting to convert boolean values into timestamps, resulting in an exception.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the section where it checks if new_data.dtype is "object" and then attempts to convert it to "int64". This might lead to incorrect data conversion for boolean values.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function is attempting to convert data into date columns, including boolean values, which is not a valid operation.
   (b). The "Parser" class contains the _try_convert_to_date method, suggesting that it is responsible for handling data conversion to date columns.
   (c). Related functions in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file might also contribute to the issue by passing boolean values to the _try_convert_to_date method.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides specific details about the problem, including sample code and expected outputs, along with the environment and library versions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Modifying the _try_convert_to_date method to handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them into timestamps.
   (b). Adding a check in the _try_convert_to_date method to skip any conversion for boolean values.
   (c). Ensuring that the method only attempts to convert valid data types into timestamps.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # Skip conversion for boolean values
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
This corrected code includes a check to skip data conversion for boolean values, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
