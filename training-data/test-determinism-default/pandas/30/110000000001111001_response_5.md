The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly converting the input data to a date format. The function attempts to convert the input data to a date format, but it has some issues with the conversion logic.

The bug appears to be located in the logic for checking if the data is numeric and in the subsequent attempt to convert the data to a date format.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to use the pandas `to_datetime` function directly, without the need to manually check the data type and convert it to int64.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # Use pandas to_datetime directly
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected code directly uses the `pd.to_datetime` function to convert the input data to a date format. This should address the issues with the original code and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
