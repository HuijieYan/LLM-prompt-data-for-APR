1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, then it tries to coerce the object into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats. It also checks if the numbers are within the range and finally tries to convert the data into a datetime object. The function seems to be missing some required imports, so we should check the imports as well.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the if statement that checks if the data type is "object" and tries to coerce it into "int64". There might be an issue with this conversion.

3. The bug's cause can be due to the incorrect handling of the data type conversion and the date parsing process.

4. Approach for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the required imports are present
   - Use a more robust method to check and convert the data type to int64 if it is an object
   - Ensure that the date parsing process is handled properly for different date units

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import iNaT
from pandas import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- I have added the required import statements for the functions used in the `_try_convert_to_date` function.
- Replaced the conversion of data type to "int64" with `pd.to_numeric` to ensure a more robust conversion.
- Added appropriate error handling for the date parsing process.
- Ensured that the correct variable names are used for accessing properties from the self object.
