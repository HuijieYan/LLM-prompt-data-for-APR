1. The buggy function is intended to parse a ndarray into a date column by trying to coerce objects in epoch or iso formats and integers or floats in epoch formats. However, there are several potential errors and issues in the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it attempts to coerce object types into int64 and then converts to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the conversion and parsing of date formats correctly. It also has issues with handling the data type and checking for out of range values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly handling the conversion of object types into int64, checking for out of range values, and handling the date parsing more effectively.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the handling of object type coercion, out of range value checking, and the date parsing using the `to_datetime` function.
