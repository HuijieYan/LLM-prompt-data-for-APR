1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is used to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column, but it seems to be incorrectly converting boolean values into timestamps, as reported in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the function is the section that handles the conversion of boolean values to timestamps.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly treating boolean values as if they were timestamps, resulting in unexpected output for boolean input. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where a JSON list of boolean values is being incorrectly converted to timestamps instead of being parsed as boolean values.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle boolean values and parse them as boolean values, rather than trying to convert them into timestamps.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, True
    elif data.empty:
        return data, False
    else:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected function includes the use of `is_bool_dtype` to check if the input data is of boolean type. If the data is of boolean type, it returns the data as-is with a boolean value of True. Otherwise, it tries to convert the data to datetime using `pd.to_datetime` and returns the result with a boolean value of True if successful. If the conversion fails, it returns the original data with a boolean value of False.

This corrected function should now correctly handle boolean values and parse them as boolean values, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
