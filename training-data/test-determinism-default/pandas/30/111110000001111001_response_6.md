The problem with the given function is that it is not properly handling the conversion of data to date and handling date units. It also seems to be missing the necessary imports for the required functions.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the handling of the date units and the conversion of data to date.

The bug's cause is due to incorrect handling of date units and the conversion of data to date.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the date units are being correctly handled and that the data conversion to date is also correct. We also need to add the necessary imports for the functions used in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        in_range = np.empty_like(new_data, dtype=bool)
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the date units and the conversion of data to date, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
