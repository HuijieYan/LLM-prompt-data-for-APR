1. The buggy function takes in a data array and tries to parse it into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, then it attempts to convert object data types to "int64" and check for out of range numbers. Afterward, it tries to convert the data to date using a specified date unit and returns a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the sections where it tries to convert object data types to "int64" and when it checks for out of range numbers. There might also be an issue with the date conversion and error handling.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of data types and ranges, as well as potential issues with the date conversion and error handling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Properly handling the conversion of object data types to "int64"
   - Implementing correct logic for checking out of range numbers
   - Ensuring proper error handling during the date conversion process

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("float").astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            if not new_data.isnull().all():
                return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
            
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The object data type conversion has been fixed to convert to "float" before converting to "int64".
- The logic for checking out of range numbers has been adjusted to correctly handle NaN and NaT values.
- Error handling during the date conversion process has been improved by using "coerce" for the errors parameter in the to_datetime function and checking for null values after conversion.
