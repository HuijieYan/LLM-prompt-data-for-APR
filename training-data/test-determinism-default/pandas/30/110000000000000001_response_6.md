1. The buggy function is a method that attempts to convert a given ndarray into a date column by parsing it in various date formats. However, it has some issues with handling the conversion and returning the correct results.

2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of the date conversion and the conditional statements that check for the range of the numbers.

3. The cause of the bug is primarily due to incorrect handling of the data type and the range of the numbers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for the data type and converting it to the appropriate format before parsing it as a date.
   - Properly handling the range of the numbers to ensure that only valid dates are returned.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) 
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
        
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
- Changed `data` to `new_data` when checking the dtype and performing the conversion.
- Updated the condition for checking the range of numbers to use `new_data` consistently.
- Updated `isna(new_data._values)` to `isna(new_data)` for checking NaN values.
- Removed the unnecessary import statements and used `new_data` consistently throughout the function.
