The problem lies within the `_try_convert_to_date` function, where the function attempts to convert boolean values to a datetime. This is not the expected behavior when reading a JSON with typ="series" containing boolean values.

The failing test provides the following error message:
```
TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime
```

The GitHub issue describes the problem in detail, where the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean types correctly and return a Series of bools instead of attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

With this corrected version, the function will now handle boolean types correctly and return a Series of bools.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, as it addresses the incorrect conversion of boolean values to datetime.
