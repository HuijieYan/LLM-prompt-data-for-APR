In this case, the problem arises from the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `Parser` class. The function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetimes, which is not a valid conversion.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the TypeError is raised because a boolean value is not convertible to a datetime. The failing test also specifies that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of boolean values, but the function is currently converting them to datetimes.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values properly and return a Pandas Series of boolean values as the expected output.

The following code snippet shows the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # ... (other methods)

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        else:
            new_data = data.astype(float)

        if not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or len(new_data) == 0:
            return new_data, True

        # Convert boolean values to datetimes
        date_series = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
        if date_series.isna().all():
            return data, False
        else:
            return date_series, True
```

By handling boolean values properly and returning a Pandas Series of boolean values in the corrected `_try_convert_to_date` function, the bug should be fixed.

This code modification should also satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the `read_json` function of Pandas when `typ="series"` is used.
