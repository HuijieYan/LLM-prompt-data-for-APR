1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a part of the `Parser` class. It is being used in the context of reading JSON data and converting it to a Pandas Series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion logic for parsing data into a date column. The function attempts various conversions and checks if the data is in range for timestamps, but it is not handling the case of boolean data correctly.

3. The bug's cause is:
   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert the input data into a date column without handling the case of boolean data correctly.
   (b). The `Parser` class seems to be related to parsing and processing data, but the exact relationship with the bug is not entirely clear.
   (c). The GitHub issue states that `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")` results in a Pandas Series of datetime64 values instead of boolean. The issue is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function not handling boolean values correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve adding a condition to handle boolean values separately, ensuring that they are not converted to timestamps. Additionally, the `Parser` class should be reviewed to understand its usage within the context of the bug and make any necessary adjustments.

5. Updated and corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if is_bool_dtype(data):  # Check if the data is of boolean type
            return data, True  # Return the data as is with a flag for successful parsing
        
        new_data = data
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the data is of boolean type. If it is, the function returns the data without conversion and a flag for successful parsing. This change will address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
