1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method within the `_json.py` file of the pandas library. It is responsible for attempting to convert a ndarray into a date column by parsing it into different date formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for numbers that are out of range and when it tries to convert the data into different date formats.

3. The bug's cause could be due to a mismatch in data types, improper handling of exceptions, or incorrect conversion of data to date formats.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the data types are properly checked and handled before conversion.
   - Adding proper exception handling to catch any errors during the conversion process.
   - Verifying the logic for checking if numbers are out of range and handling it accordingly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
