Potential error location: 
The potential error is that the function is not correctly converting the data to date format, and it is also not handling exceptions properly.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is not correctly converting the data to date format and is not handling exceptions properly. 
(b) The buggy class `Parser` contains this function and is responsible for parsing ndarray-like data into a date column.
(c) The function is also using other related functions like `isna`, `to_datetime`, and `iNaT` which are not shown in the provided code but are assumed to be part of the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly handle the conversion of data to date format.
2. Implement proper exception handling to ensure that the function does not fail when errors occur during conversion.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
1. `import numpy as np` is added since the code uses `np.number`.
2. Change `new_data = data.astype("int64")` to `new_data = new_data.astype("int64")` for correct data type conversion.
3. Exception handling is added to properly catch and handle exceptions during date conversion.
4. Corrected some other minor syntax and variable name issues.
