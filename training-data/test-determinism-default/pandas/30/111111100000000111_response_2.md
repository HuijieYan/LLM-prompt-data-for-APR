1. The buggy function seems to be related to the parsing of a ndarray into a date column. It attempts to coerce data into date formats and integers or floats into epoch formats, returning a boolean if parsing was successful. The bug was reported in a GitHub issue related to using `pd.read_json()` with `typ="series"`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for parsing data into date formats, as the reported issue is related to unexpected datetime outputs when using `pd.read_json()` with `typ="series"`.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_try_convert_to_date` function attempts to convert data into date formats, but it may have a flawed logic causing unexpected behavior.
   (b). The Parser class is responsible for parsing and converting data, so the bug could potentially lie within this class.
   (c). Related functions such as `pd.read_json()` may also play a role in triggering the unexpected behavior by invoking the buggy `_try_convert_to_date` function.
   (d). The GitHub issue information clearly describes the unexpected behavior and its impact, providing a clear indication of the bug's cause.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Reviewing the logic within the `_try_convert_to_date` function to ensure it correctly handles conversions to date formats.
   (b). Checking for any inconsistencies in the Parser class that could lead to unexpected behavior during parsing.
   (c). Testing the function with different input types and values to identify specific edge cases that may trigger the unexpected behavior.
   (d). Updating the function to handle the reported issue with `pd.read_json()` and `typ="series"`.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)  # Updated 'errors' parameter
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
                        
        return data, False

# Updated 'to_datetime' function with 'errors' parameter and modified exception handling
```
The corrected code includes updates to the `_try_convert_to_date` function, specifically modifying the `to_datetime` function to handle errors more effectively and adjusting the exception handling. These changes aim to address the reported issue with unexpected datetime outputs when using `pd.read_json()` with `typ="series"`.
