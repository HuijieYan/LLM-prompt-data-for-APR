1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is a method of the Parser class. It is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray into a date column.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the new_data variable and the conditions for parsing data into a date column.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function tries to coerce object types into int64, but it doesn't handle other types properly.
   (b). The class Parser may not have some required attributes initialized or defined, such as self.date_unit or self.min_stamp.
   (c). The related function isna and to_datetime might be causing exceptions that are not being handled properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle different data types properly, not just object type.
   - Ensure that all required attributes of the class are properly defined and initialized.
   - Properly handle exceptions that may be thrown by related functions.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype
from pandas import to_datetime

class Parser():
    # the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(data.dtype):
            return data, True

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```
In the corrected code, we handle different data types properly and use the is_datetime64_any_dtype function to check if the data is already in datetime format. We also directly use to_datetime to try to parse the data into datetime format and handle any exceptions that may be thrown. Additionally, we assume that self.date_unit is already initialized and defined elsewhere in the class.
