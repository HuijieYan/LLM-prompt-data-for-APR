1. The buggy function looks like it is trying to convert a given data into a date format. It first checks if the data is not empty, then tries to convert the data to int64 if it's in "object" format. It also checks for numbers that are out of range and finally tries to convert the data to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to convert the data to int64 and when it checks for numbers that are out of range.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be:
   (a). Incorrect handling of data type conversion
   (b). Incorrect handling of values that are out of range

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
   (a). Properly handle the data type conversion
   (b). Properly handle the check for numbers that are out of range

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Used `pd.to_numeric` to convert data to numeric type for objects
- Replaced `isna` with `pd.isna`
- Removed the check for `iNaT` as it was not defined in the provided code.
