The cause of the bug is that the `input_layers` list is empty, so the subsequent loop to create placeholders for the input tensors does not run, leaving `input_tensors` empty as well.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to handle the case when `input_tensors` is None and create placeholders for the input tensors in this case.
2. We need to handle the case when `input_tensors` is not None and ensure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                raise ValueError("All input tensors must come from a Keras layer.")
            _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle both cases of input_tensors being None or not None correctly and pass the failing test.
