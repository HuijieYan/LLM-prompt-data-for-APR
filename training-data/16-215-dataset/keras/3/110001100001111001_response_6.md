The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is attempting to clone a functional Keras model by creating new layers and instantiating new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The function first checks the input model, then creates new layers and input tensors based on the model's input layers. It then iterates over the nodes of the model to create the corresponding layers and update the tensor map.

The potential error in the function might be occurring at the section where it checks for existing input tensors and creates new input layers if necessary. It seems that the logic for creating new input layers and updating the layer map might be incorrect.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the creation of new input layers and the update of the layer map is done correctly based on the model's input layers and input tensors.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # Updated code for creating input layers and updating layer map
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            input_layers.append(layer)  # Track the input layers for later use
        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
            layer_map[original] = cloned
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        # Rest of the code for handling input tensors remains unchanged

    # ... (remaining code for cloning the model and creating new layers)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the newly created input layers are properly tracked and updated in the layer map based on the model's input layers. Additionally, the handling of input tensors is left unchanged as it is not directly related to the potential bug.
