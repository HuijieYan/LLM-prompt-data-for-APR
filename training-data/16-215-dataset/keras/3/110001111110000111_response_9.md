The buggy function in question is the `_clone_functional_model` function in the `keras/models.py` file. The function is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` in `test_sequential_model.py` attempts to clone a functional model with multiple outputs using the `clone_model` function from `keras.models`. However, the error message indicates that the function is failing to compute the output tensor for a specific layer (`Could not compute output Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)`).

The GitHub issue provides additional context, suggesting that the issue may be related to the use of a layer with multiple outputs without mask support, causing the error to appear.

To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of layers with multiple outputs and ensure proper computation of output tensors, especially in cases where layers do not support masks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
1. Checking for mask support in layers and handling the computation of output masks accordingly.
2. Ensuring that layers with multiple outputs are properly handled during the cloning process.
3. Addressing any issues related to the use of layers without mask support and their impact on the computation of output tensors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Clone the model
    new_model = keras.models.clone_model(model)

    return new_model
```

In this corrected version, we simplify the function to use the built-in `clone_model` function from `keras.models` to clone the model. This should address the issue of handling layers with multiple outputs and ensure proper computation of output tensors.
