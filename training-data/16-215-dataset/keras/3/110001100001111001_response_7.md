The main issue in the provided code is that the function `_clone_functional_model` does not correctly handle the cloning of the input layers and their associated tensors. It fails to properly create new layers and tensors for each input, leading to incorrect behavior when creating the cloned model.

To address this issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Ensure that new input layers and tensors are correctly created for each input of the original model, and that these are appropriately added to the `input_layers` and `input_tensors` lists.
2. Make sure that the creation and mapping of input layers and tensors is consistent throughout the function.
3. Verify that all input tensors are correctly included in the `tensor_map` to ensure that the model outputs can be computed.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_layers.append(input_tensor)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    for i, input_layer in enumerate(input_layers):
        layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_layer
        tensor_map[model.inputs[i]] = (input_layer, None)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # Instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_layers, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that new input layers and tensors are correctly created and mapped, resolving the issues highlighted in the original buggy function.
