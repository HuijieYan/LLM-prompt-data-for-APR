1. The buggy function is a cloning function `_clone_functional_model` which is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance in Keras. The GitHub issue is related to using `clone_model` with `multi_gpu_model` and encountering an error related to computing output Tensor.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the computation of output_tensors and output_masks. This is evident from the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that the output_masks are always [None] even though [None, None] is expected.

3. (a). The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional Model instance. It seems that the issue could be related to the cloning process where the output_masks are not computed as expected.

   (b). The GitHub issue mentions that the error occurs because the output_masks are always [None] instead of [None, None]. This is attributed to the fact that the layer.compute_mask(...) always returns None since Lambda doesn't support using masks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the cloning function to handle cases where the layer.compute_mask() returns None for certain layers, especially in the case of Lambda layers.
   - Check whether the issue is related to the specific version of Keras and TensorFlow being used, and if there are any known compatibility issues or bugs that have been fixed in later releases.
   - Consider modifying the cloning logic to handle Lambda layers and their masks differently, or to bypass the mask computation for these layers.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_clone_functional_model` which addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post:

```python
from keras.models import Model, Input
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import InputLayer
from keras.utils import to_list
from keras import backend as K

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code here...
    # ... existing code ...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code here...
            # ... existing code ...

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map, then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call the layer and handle mask issues for Lambda layers
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                if isinstance(layer, Lambda) and hasattr(layer, 'compute_mask'):
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(*computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    computed_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)  # Set masks to None for Lambda layer
                else:
                    # Call layer.
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(*computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(*computed_tensors, mask=[x[1] for x in computed_data]))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # remaining code...
    # ... remaining code ...
```

In the corrected code, the handling of masking for Lambda layers has been modified to always set the computed_masks to None for Lambda layers. This addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post where the masks for Lambda layers were causing the error. Additionally, the logic for handling masks has been enhanced to address the specific case described in the GitHub issue.
