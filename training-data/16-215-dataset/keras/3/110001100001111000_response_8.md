The issue with the given function is that it is mistakenly checking if the input model is an instance of `Sequential` instead of checking whether it is an instance of the base `Model` class. Additionally, there are some issues with the creation of input placeholders and the handling of input tensors. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    
    Args:
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: Optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    Returns:
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    Raises:
        ValueError: In case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [None for _ in range(len(model.inputs))]

    # Create a new model using the same configuration
    cloned_model = Model.from_config(model.get_config())

    # Build the model based on the provided input tensors
    if input_tensors:
        cloned_model.build(input_tensors)

    return cloned_model
```

I've refactored the function to ensure that it checks if the input is an instance of the `Model` class and handles the input tensors properly. Additionally, I imported the `Model` class from `tensorflow.keras.models`.

This corrected version should resolve the issues with the original function.
