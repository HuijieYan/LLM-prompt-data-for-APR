1. The buggy function in the keras/models.py file is _clone_functional_model, which is responsible for cloning a functional Model instance. The GitHub issue is related to using the clone_model function with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True, resulting in an "Could not compute output Tensor" error.

2. The potential error within the _clone_functional_model function seems to be with the handling of output_masks, which are expected to be [None, None], but are always returning [None]. This is caused by the Lambda layer not supporting masks, and the function not handling this scenario appropriately.

3. (a) The buggy function handles the cloning of a functional Model instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing existing ones.
   (b) The related functions, such as clone_model and multi_gpu_model, are used in the GitHub issue and are related to the use of the _clone_functional_model function.
   (c) The GitHub Issue provides the information that the error is related to output_masks always returning [None], and this is caused by the Lambda layer not supporting masks.

4. To fix the bug, the _clone_functional_model function needs to be modified to handle scenarios where the output_masks may not be supported by certain layers, such as the Lambda layer. Additionally, the function should be updated to handle the multi_gpu_model and clone_model scenarios, ensuring that the output_masks are correctly handled.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code...

                if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                    # existing code...

                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]

                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors))
                        for i in range(len(output_masks), len(reference_output_tensors)):
                            output_masks.append(None)
                    else:
                        output_masks = [None] * len(reference_output_tensors)

                    # Update tensor_map.
                    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
    
    # existing code...

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of output_masks has been updated to ensure that it is correctly handled for layers that do not support masks, such as the Lambda layer. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the _clone_functional_model function can handle the scenarios mentioned.
