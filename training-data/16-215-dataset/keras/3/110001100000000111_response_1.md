The issue in the provided buggy function seems to be related to the computations involving masks in the `clone_model` function, specifically in the loop where `output_masks` are being computed. The error arises when using a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without a mask support, causing the `output_masks` to always be `[None]`, but an array of the expected size is required.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle cases where the layer does not support masks, and ensure that the size of `output_masks` matches the expected size of `reference_output_tensors`. We can handle this by introducing conditional checks to determine whether the layer supports masks and adjust the computation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # ... (existing code)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    output_masks = []  # Initialize output_masks list
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        if mask is not None:  # Check if mask is not None
            output_masks.append(mask)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name), output_masks
```

By making the mentioned changes, we can ensure that the `output_masks` are properly handled and returned, allowing the function to support cases where the layer does not support masks and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
