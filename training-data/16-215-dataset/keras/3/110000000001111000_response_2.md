The issue in the provided code is that the `layer` object is being reused without creating a new instance in the loop, which causes unexpected behavior when cloning the model. To fix the issue, we need to create a new instance of the layer inside the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]  # Replace the existing layer with the cloned layer

            # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By creating a new instance of the layer inside the loop, the function will correctly clone the layers as intended.
