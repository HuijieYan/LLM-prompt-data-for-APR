Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the provided function might be due to how the input tensors are handled, as well as the iteration over the reference model. The function is attempting to clone a functional model, but the handling of input tensors and the iteration through the model nodes seem to be causing issues.

Bug's Cause:

(a) The buggy function is attempting to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers with new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. 
(b) The function is handling input tensors and iterating through the model nodes to clone the layers involved in the model.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

- Ensure proper handling of input tensors by creating placeholders if not provided, and mapping existing input tensors to newly created ones.
- Refactor the iteration over the reference model to ensure proper cloning of layers and their weights.
- Handle errors and exceptions more effectively, especially when computing the model outputs.

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    input_layers = model._input_layers

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
    
    tensor_map = {x: y for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors)}

    layer_map = {}
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        tensor_map[layer.output] = new_layer.output

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
