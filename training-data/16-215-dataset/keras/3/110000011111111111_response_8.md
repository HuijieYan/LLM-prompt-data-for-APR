The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the portion of the code where it handles the creation of new layers and input tensors, as well as the mapping of input and output tensors.

Based on the failing test and error message, it seems like the problem arises when the function is unable to compute the output tensors for the model. This is likely due to an issue with the creation and mapping of input and output tensors during the cloning process.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable information is evident in the fact that the function is not properly creating and mapping the input tensors, leading to the failure to compute the model outputs.

The GitHub issue further confirms the problem, highlighting the issue of multi outputs without mask support leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the creation and mapping of input and output tensors, particularly in cases where there are multiple outputs without mask support.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            continue
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
    
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code ensures that the input_tensors and output_tensors are properly handled and mapped during the model cloning process. It addresses the issue of multi outputs without mask support and should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
