The potential error location within the buggy function is in the section where it processes the output masks for each layer. The function incorrectly assumes that the layer.compute_mask function will always return a value, leading to the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of output masks for layers that do not support masks, such as the Lambda layer. This results in the output_masks being set to None, which causes the AssertionError when trying to compute the output tensors.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the layer supports masking before attempting to compute the masks. If the layer does not support masking, the output_masks should be set to None for that particular layer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code...

            # Check if the layer supports masking
            if has_arg(layer.compute_mask, 'mask'):
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
            else:
                output_masks = [None] * len(computed_tensors)

            # Update tensor_map
            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # existing code...

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code now checks if the layer supports masking before attempting to compute the masks. If the layer does not support masking, it sets the output_masks to None for that layer. This approach should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
