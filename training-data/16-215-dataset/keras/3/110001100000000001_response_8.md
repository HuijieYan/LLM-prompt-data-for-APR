Analysis:
The buggy function is meant to clone a functional Model instance. The function creates new layers and new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The potential error location within the problematic function is the cloning of the layers and weights.

Bug Cause:
The potential cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of creating new layers and weights when cloning the model. The function is not correctly handling the creation and instantiation of new layers and weights.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `clone_model` function from the Keras library, which is specifically designed for cloning models, rather than implementing the cloning logic manually.
2. Ensure that the new layers and weights are instantiated correctly when creating the cloned model.
3. Check for any inconsistencies in the input tensors and layer mappings.

Corrected Code:
```python
from keras.models import clone_model

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, but with new layers and weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    cloned_model = clone_model(model)

    if input_tensors is not None:
        cloned_model._clears_existing_funtional_model()
        inputs = cloned_model.inputs
        outputs = cloned_model(inputs)
        cloned_model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    
    return cloned_model
```
In the corrected code, the `clone_model` function from the Keras library is used to clone the original model. If input tensors are provided, the function clears the existing functional model, creates new inputs, and then instantiates a new model with the updated inputs and outputs.
