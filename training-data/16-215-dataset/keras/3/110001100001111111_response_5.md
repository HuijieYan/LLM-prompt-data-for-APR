The issue is caused by the buggy function `_clone_functional_model` in the `keras/models.py` file. The function is failing to compute the output tensors correctly when input tensors are cloned. This is leading to the `AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor` when using `clone_model` and `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`.

The issue arises from the fact that the function does not handle layers without mask support correctly, resulting in `output_masks` being set to `None`. This is not expected behavior as the `output_masks` should be `[None, None]`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle layers without mask support properly by ensuring that `output_masks` has the correct value.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    
    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    output_masks = []  # Initialize the list for output masks
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]  # Retrieve the mask from tensor_map
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        output_masks.append(mask)  # Append the mask to the list
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name), output_masks  # Return the output masks as well
```

The corrected function now properly handles layers without mask support and returns the correct output masks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Additionally, in order to prevent any potential issues and to ensure compatibility with the `clone_model` and `multi_gpu_model` functions, it would be a good practice to update the `clone_model` and `multi_gpu_model` functions in Keras to use the corrected `_clone_functional_model` implementation. This way, any usage of `clone_model` or `multi_gpu_model` would benefit from the fix provided.
