# The buggy function should be corrected as follows:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ' + str(x))
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

The corrected function now checks if each model output is computed in the `tensor_map` before continuing. If any output is not computed, it raises a `ValueError` with the corresponding message.
