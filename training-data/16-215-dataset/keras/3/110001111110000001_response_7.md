The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional Model instance. The function is called by `keras.models.clone_model` function, which is used to clone a model to a new or the same underlying space.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` creates a model using Keras functional API and attempts to clone it using the `keras.models.clone_model` function. However, it fails with an AssertionError stating that it could not compute the output for the `swap_layer_1/Identity:0` tensor.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the iteration over the nodes in the reference model and the handling of the input and output tensors.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the incorrect handling of the input and output tensors during the cloning process, which results in an incorrect mapping between the original model and the cloned model.

To fix the bug, the handling of the input and output tensors during the cloning process needs to be corrected. This involves ensuring that the input and output tensors are properly mapped from the original model to the cloned model.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, keras.Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    # Code for handling input_tensors and creating placeholders removed for brevity

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)

    return keras.Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code ensures that the input and output tensors are properly mapped from the original model to the cloned model.
