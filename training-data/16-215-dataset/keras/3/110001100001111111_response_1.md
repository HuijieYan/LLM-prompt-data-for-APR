The issue is occurring in the `_clone_functional_model` function from the `keras/models.py` file, particularly when the function is called with a model that has a layer without mask support. This results in the `output_masks` always being `[None]` instead of `[None, None]` as expected, which causes the error when the new model is instantiated from inputs and outputs.

The potential error location within the function is in the section where it processes the `output_masks` for layers that do not support masks, particularly in the block of code that starts at line 153 in the `keras/models.py` file.

To fix the bug, the section of the code that handles the computation of `output_masks` needs to be modified to handle layers without mask support properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
# Assuming this import statement is present in the actual file
from tensorflow.python.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # previous code remains the same

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # other code remains the same

            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            output_tensors = layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)
            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected code, the section that computes `output_tensors` and updates `tensor_map` has been modified to handle layers without mask support properly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
