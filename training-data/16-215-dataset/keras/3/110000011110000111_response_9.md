The potential error location within the `_clone_functional_model` function in the `tensor_map` creation loop. It seems that the `tensor_map` is not properly populated with the output tensors and their corresponding values, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is testing the cloning of a functional model with multiple outputs. The error message shows that the assertion error occurs when checking if the output tensors were computed properly.

The GitHub issue also provides information about a similar issue with multi-output layers and the use of `clone_model`, indicating that the bug might be related to the handling of multi-output layers without mask support.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `tensor_map` is properly populated with the output tensors and their corresponding values during the iteration over the reference model's nodes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_data, **kwargs))  # Use computed_data directly
                if not isinstance(output_tensors, list):
                    output_tensors = [output_tensors]
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = y  # Update tensor_map directly

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version:
- `computed_data` is populated with the directly from `tensor_map` without including the mask.
- There's a check to ensure that `output_tensors` is converted to a list if it's not already a list.
- `tensor_map[x] = y` is used to directly update `tensor_map` with the computed output tensors.

By making these changes, the corrected function should properly clone the functional model and handle multi-output layers without mask support.
