Analysis:
The buggy function _clone_model function is a part of Keras, and it is used to clone a functional Model instance. The GitHub issue is related to an error that occurs when using clone_model in combination with multi_gpu_model. The bug seems to be related to the computation of output tensors when the original model has multiple outputs without mask support.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the computation of output_tensors and output_masks when iterating over the nodes in the model. This is where the bug is likely occurring.

Bug Cause:
The bug cause is due to the computation of output_masks always returning None when using layers without mask support, such as Lambda layers. This causes the output_masks to be incorrect, leading to the Assertion error when checking for output tensors.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to handle layers without mask support appropriately when computing output_masks.
2. Check for layers without mask support and handle them differently to ensure that the output_masks are correctly computed.

Corrected Code:
```python
from keras.engine.network import Network

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (code for function definition)

    # Check if model is an instance of Network and handle it separately
    if isinstance(model, Network):
        cloned_network = model.__class__.from_config(model.get_config())
        return cloned_network

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

By handling the cloning of Network instances separately, the function will be able to correctly handle models with multiple outputs and layers without mask support, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
