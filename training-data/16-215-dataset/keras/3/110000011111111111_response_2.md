The bug in the provided function `_clone_functional_model` seems to be related to the creation and handling of input tensors, as well as the mapping of tensors and layers. The error message from the failing test indicates that the output tensor "swap_layer_1/Identity:0" cannot be computed. This suggests that there is an issue with the mapping of tensors and layers, and possibly with the handling of multiple outputs.

The failing test includes the creation of a model with multiple inputs and outputs, as well as layers with single input and multiple outputs. This suggests that the bug might be related to how the function handles models with multiple inputs and outputs, and how it processes layers with multiple outputs.

The GitHub issue also provides insight into potential causes of the error, mentioning issues with layer mask support and multiple output layers.

The function `_clone_functional_model` needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to better handle multiple inputs and outputs, as well as the creation and mapping of input tensors and layers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Reviewing the handling of multiple inputs and outputs to ensure correct mapping and processing of tensors and layers
- Addressing issues related to layer mask support and multiple output layers
- Ensuring that the cloned model retains the behavior of the original model with respect to multiple inputs and outputs
- Handling the creation of input placeholders and their mapping to the model's input layers effectively

Here's a corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.input_layers]
    else:
        input_layers = [layer for layer in model.input_layers]
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                input_layer = input_layers[i]
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, batch_shape=input_layer.batch_input_shape[1:], dtype=input_layer.dtype, sparse=input_layer.sparse, name='input_wrapper_for_' + input_layer.name)
                input_layers[i] = input_tensor
                layer_map[input_layer] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_layers):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = [(tensor_map[x][0], tensor_map[x][1]) for x in reference_input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_layers, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to input tensor creation, layer mapping, and multiple outputs. It aims to properly clone the functional model while addressing the specific issues encountered in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.
