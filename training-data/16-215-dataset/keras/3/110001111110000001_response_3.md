The buggy function is supposed to clone a functional `Model` instance. It creates new layers and new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The failing test is trying to clone a functional model with multiple outputs, but it encounters an assertion error at the end of the `_clone_functional_model` function. The error message indicates that it could not compute the output for a specific tensor.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the process of updating the `tensor_map`. It seems that the code is not able to compute the output for a particular tensor, which leads to the assertion error.

It is likely that there is an issue with how the `tensor_map` is being updated during the iteration over the nodes in the model.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the process of updating the `tensor_map` and ensure that it correctly handles all the reference and output tensors.
2. Verify that the inputs and outputs from each operation are correctly propagated through the `tensor_map`.
3. Ensure that the layers and their configurations are being cloned accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = keras.layers.deserialize(keras.layers.serialize(layer))
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, keras.layers.InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data] if len(computed_data[0]) > 1 else None

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                if isinstance(layer, keras.layers.Masking):
                    computed_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                tensor_map.update(zip(reference_output_tensors, zip(output_tensors, computed_masks) if computed_masks else output_tensors))

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return keras.Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By using `keras.layers.deserialize` to clone layers and updating the `tensor_map` accurately for each layer's inputs and outputs, the corrected code should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
