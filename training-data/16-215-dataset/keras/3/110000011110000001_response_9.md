The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is meant to clone a functional `Model` instance in Keras. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to create a model with multiple outputs, clone it using the `_clone_functional_model` function and then compare the predictions of the original and the cloned model.

Reading through the code and the error message, it seems that the bug is likely located in the part of the function where it iterates over every node in the reference model and tries to call node.inbound_layer on them.

The error message indicates that the model failed to compute the output for a particular tensor: `AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)`. This suggests that there might be an issue in computing the output for this tensor during the cloning process.

To fix the bug, we can modify the iteration over nodes and the calculation of output_tensors and make sure that the output_tensors are correctly computed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if hasattr(layer, 'input')]
    for ref_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[ref_input] = new_input

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth.keys():
        for layer in model._nodes_by_depth[node]:
            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[layer]

            input_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in layer.input]
            if len(input_tensors) == 1:
                output_tensors = new_layer(input_tensors[0])
            else:
                output_tensors = new_layer(input_tensors)

            for ref_output, new_output in zip(layer.output, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[ref_output] = new_output

    return Model(input_tensors, [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs])
```

This corrected function creates new layers and input tensors for the cloned model, and correctly iterates through the model's layers and nodes to create new output tensors. This version of the function should pass the failing test.
