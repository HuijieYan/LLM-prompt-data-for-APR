1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related functions and the GitHub issue, we can see that the function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional Model instance. The GitHub issue reports an error 'Could not compute output Tensor' when using `clone_model()` with `cpu_relocation=True`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it computes the output masks for the cloned layers. Specifically, the function `layer.compute_mask` within the for loop may not be returning the expected values, leading to the error reported in the GitHub issue.

3. (a). The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional Model instance.
   (b). The related function is `clone_model` from the Keras library, which is used to clone a model.
   (c). The GitHub issue reports an error 'Could not compute output Tensor' when using `clone_model()` with `cpu_relocation=True`, and it points to a specific line in the `clone_model` function that may be responsible for the issue.

   The cause of the bug seems to be related to the computation of output masks for the cloned layers. In the `_clone_functional_model` function, the model cloning process involves creating new layers and new weights. However, the computation of output masks for certain layers (e.g., Lambda layers) may not be producing the expected values, leading to the reported error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   a. Modify the code within the `_clone_functional_model` function to handle the computation of output masks for layers that do not support mask computation, such as Lambda layers. This could involve introducing conditional checks to handle different layer types appropriately.
   b. Update the cloning process to ensure that unexpected errors related to output mask computation are handled gracefully, possibly by providing default masks for layers that do not support mask computation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    for original_layer, input_layer in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_layer] = input_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

        # Reuse previously cloned layer
        layer = layer_map[layer]

        for node in layer._inbound_nodes:
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            computed_data = [tensor_map[x] for x in reference_input_tensors if x in tensor_map]
            
            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map[node.output_tensors[0]] = (output_tensors[0], None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code handles the cloning process by creating input layers if input tensors are not provided, mapping input tensors to their corresponding layers, and then processing the layers to compute the output tensors. This approach aims to address the reported issue related to output mask computation and model cloning.
