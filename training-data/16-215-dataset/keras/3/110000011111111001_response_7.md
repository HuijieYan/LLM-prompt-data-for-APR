The bug is occurring in the `_clone_functional_model` function when it attempts to clone the layers from the input model and build a new model using the cloned layers. The failing test is indicating that the output tensors of the model cannot be computed, which suggests that there is an issue with the layer cloning process.

The function should clone the layers and create a new model using the cloned layers, but it seems to be encountering issues with the layer cloning process. This might be due to improper mapping of input and output tensors during the layer cloning.

To fix the bug, we can update the layer mapping and TensorMap to ensure that the relationships between the original layers and the newly cloned layers are correctly established.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {} 
    tensor_map = {}  
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
  
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly clone the functional model and associate the input and output tensors with the cloned layers. This should resolve the issues highlighted by the failing test.
