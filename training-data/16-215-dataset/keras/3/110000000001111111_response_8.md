The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the output_masks which will always be None since the Lambda layer doesn't support using masks. This leads to the error when the actual output_masks are compared to the expected output_masks in the GitHub issue.

The bug's cause is that the output_masks are always set to None, while the expected output_masks should be [None, None]. This is because the Lambda layer in the model doesn't support using masks. As a result, when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support, the error occurs.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where the layer doesn't support using masks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if has_arg(layer.compute_mask, 'arguments'):
            mask = layer.compute_mask(x, mask)
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```
With this modification, the code will check if the layer supports computing masks using the `has_arg(layer.compute_mask, 'arguments')` call. If the layer supports it, then the mask will be computed using `layer.compute_mask(x, mask)`. This ensures that the output_masks will be correctly computed for layers that support using masks, and the bug described in the GitHub issue will be resolved.
