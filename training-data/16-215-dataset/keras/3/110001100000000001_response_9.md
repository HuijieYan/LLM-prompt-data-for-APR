The potential error in the function _clone_functional_model lies in the implementation of layer cloning and the mapping of input and output tensors. The function aims to create a clone of a given functional Model instance with new layers and weights. However, there are several issues within the function that lead to errors.

One issue is the incorrect handling of input tensors. The function either creates new input placeholders or tries to reuse existing input tensors, but the logic for this process is flawed. Additionally, the cloning of layers is not handled properly, leading to incorrect mapping of input and output tensors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be restructured to ensure the correct handling of input tensors and the proper cloning of layers.

The corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function is as follows:

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=inp.shape[1:]) for inp in model.inputs]
    
    layer_map = {}
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_config = layer.get_config()
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer_config)
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    
    input_map = {model.input_layers[i]: input_tensors[i] for i in range(len(model.input_layers))}
    
    for node in model.nodes:
        for i, inp in enumerate(node.input_tensors):
            if inp in input_map:
                node.input_tensors[i] = input_map[inp]
    
    output_tensors = [node.output_tensors[0] for node in model.nodes_by_depth[len(model.nodes_by_depth) - 1]]
    
    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the model is an instance of the Model class. Then, it creates new input tensors if not provided and creates a mapping between the original input tensors and the new input tensors. Next, it iterates through the nodes of the model to update the input tensors based on the input map. Finally, it collects the output tensors for the new model and returns the cloned functional model.
