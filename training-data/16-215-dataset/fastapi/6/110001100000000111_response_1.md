1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is supposed to convert the received request body into arguments. It seems that the issue described in the GitHub post is related to handling repeated key-value pairs in form data. The function might not be correctly handling repeated keys and is only capturing the last key-value pair. This is likely causing issues with validation against the last value only.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the shape of the field and how it retrieves the value from the form data.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle repeated key-value pairs in form data correctly and only captures the last key-value pair, leading to issues with validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: 
   - Modifying the logic to handle repeated keys and assign the values as lists to the same key before validation happens.
   - Adjusting the logic for retrieving values from the form data to properly capture and handle repeated key-value pairs.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        received_values = None

        if received_body is not None:
            # Check if the field is in the form data
            if field.alias in received_body:
                received_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                value = received_values[0] if len(received_values) == 1 else received_values

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we use the `getlist` method of the form data to retrieve all values for a given key, and if there are multiple values, we assign them as a list to the field. This will ensure that repeated key-value pairs in form data are captured and handled correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
