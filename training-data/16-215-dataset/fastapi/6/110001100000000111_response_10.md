1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body into arguments that can be used for validation. It seems to be related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" as it involves validating form data and handling repeated keys.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks for sequence shapes and handles the values for form data.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the function not properly handling repeated keys in form data, leading to only the last key=value pair being considered for validation. This aligns with the GitHub issue, where the user expects FastAPI to collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.
   - Update the logic to properly extract and validate all values for repeated keys.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [item.decode() if isinstance(item, bytes) else item for item in value]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                # Handle missing values
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value):
                        files_contents = await asyncio.gather(*[item.read() for item in value])
                        value = files_contents
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, list):
                    if all(isinstance(item, bytes) for item in value):
                        # Handle sequence shapes and file type
                        pass
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
