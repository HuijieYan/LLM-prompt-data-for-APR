1. The buggy function request_body_to_args is responsible for converting request body parameters to arguments for validation. The failing test functions are related to testing the behavior of the request_body_to_args function. The error messages indicate that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200, which suggests that the validation of form data is not working as intended. The GitHub issue is also related to form data validation and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list before validation.

2. The potential error in the problematic function may lie in the handling of repeated keys in form data and the validation process for form parameters.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the request_body_to_args function handles repeated keys in form data. It may not be correctly collecting and assigning the values as a list before validation. This leads to incorrect validation and the failing of the test cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the request_body_to_args function to handle repeated keys in form data as suggested in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the validation process for form parameters may need to be adjusted to correctly handle repeated keys.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code includes modifications to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and improve the validation process for form parameters. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
