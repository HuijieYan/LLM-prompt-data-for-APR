The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the shape of the field. It seems that there is some confusion in the logic related to handling file types and sequences.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of file and sequence shapes when processing the received body. This can lead to incorrect validation and value assignment for the fields.

To fix the bug, we need to review and refactor the conditional statements related to file and sequence shapes, ensuring that the correct logic is applied for validation and value assignment. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle any potential issues.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any, Optional, Union
from fastapi.dependencies.models import ModelField
from pydantic import ErrorWrapper, params, BaseConfig, MissingError, UploadFile
from fastapi import Form
from copy import deepcopy
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in params.sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            elif isinstance(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in params.sequence_shapes and
                isinstance(value, params.sequence_types) and
                lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = params.sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for handling different shapes and types of fields has been simplified and clarified.
- Proper error handling is implemented for handling missing values and validation errors.
- The handling of file and sequence shapes has been improved to ensure correct validation and value assignment.
