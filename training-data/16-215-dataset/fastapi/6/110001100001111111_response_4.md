The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function only retrieves the last key=value pair instead of collecting all the values for a repeated key and assigning them to a list. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior of FastAPI's Form.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles the parsing of form data and the assignment of values to the `values` dict.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data, resulting in only the last key=value pair being considered. This behavior does not align with the expected behavior and use case described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign the values to a list instead of only considering the last key=value pair.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None or (isinstance(value, list) and len(value)==0):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias)
                            )
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue

                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected code properly handles repeated keys in form data and assigns the values to a list, ensuring that all the submitted values for a repeated key are collected and processed as expected. This will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue by aligning the behavior of the function with the expected use case.
