The problematic function `request_body_to_args` takes a list of required parameters and a dictionary of received data. It then extracts the values from the received data and validates them against the required parameters. The bug likely lies in the way it processes sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples in the received data.

The failing test functions attempt to send data to the server and check if the server's response status code is 200 and if the server's response contains the expected values. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422, which means there is a validation error.

The bug may be caused by the way the function processes sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples in the received data. It seems that the function is not processing these types of data correctly, leading to validation errors.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples. It should extract the values from the received data and validate them against the required parameters for these sequence shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: fastapi/dependencies/utils.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy
import asyncio
from fastapi import UploadFile, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper

from pydantic.validators import get_field_info
from pydantic.error_wrappers import MissingError
from pydantic.types import sequence_types, lenient_issubclass
from pydantic.schema import sequence_shapes, sequence_shape_to_type
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic import BaseConfig, FormData


async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field_set = set(required_params)  # create a set of fields to keep track of which fields are filled
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile))
                    or (
                    isinstance(field_info, Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, Form) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                field_set.remove(field)  # remove the field from the set of required fields
        if field_set:  # if there are still required fields not filled
            for field in field_set:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
    return values, errors
```

The corrected function should now handle the received data correctly and correctly validate sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples. This should allow it to pass the failing tests without validation errors.
