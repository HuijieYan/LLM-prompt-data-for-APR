Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue may be related to the handling of repeated keys in the form data and how the validation process is performed for these keys.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not properly handling repeated keys in form data, causing only the last key=value pair to be considered.
(b). The related GitHub issue highlights the problem with validating repeated keys in form data and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign the values as a list before validation.
2. Update the validation process to consider all values for repeated keys.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union, Tuple, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, FormData
from fastapi import File, UploadFile, params
import asyncio
from copy import deepcopy
from pydantic.errors import ErrorWrapper, MissingError
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import get_field_info
from fastapi import params

sequence_shapes = ["list", "set", "tuple"]
sequence_shape_to_type = {
    "list": list,
    "set": set,
    "tuple": tuple
}
sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        # loop through each required parameter
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.alias in received_body and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code now addresses the issue of repeated keys in form data by properly handling and assigning the values as a list before validation. It also ensures that all values for repeated keys are considered during the validation process, resolving the problem highlighted in the GitHub issue.
