The buggy function is `request_body_to_args` which seems to be a utility function for converting a request body to function arguments or parameters. The error messages indicate that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200 in all the failing tests. This implies that the request body is not being processed correctly and is resulting in validation errors.

The potential error in the buggy function appears to be the way it handles sequence shapes (lists, sets, tuples, etc.) and form data. It seems to be encountering issues with processing the received form data for non-typing sequences.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles form data when the required parameter is a sequence (list, set, tuple). It is not correctly extracting and processing the values from the form data, which leads to validation errors and the incorrect response status codes.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the extraction of values from form data for non-typing sequences. This will involve ensuring that the form data is processed correctly and that the values are extracted in a way that is suitable for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.required and value == ""
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, (ErrorWrapper, list)):
            errors.extend(errors_ if isinstance(errors_, list) else [errors_])
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates over the required parameters and correctly extracts the values from the form data based on the shape of the field. It also properly handles the validation of the extracted values and appends any errors to the error list. This should address the issues with processing form data for non-typing sequences and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
