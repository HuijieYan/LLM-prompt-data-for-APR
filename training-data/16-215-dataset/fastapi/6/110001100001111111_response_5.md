The issue arises from the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation only considers the last key-value pair and does not collect the repeated keys as a list before validation. This causes the validation to work only with the last value, leading to unexpected behavior.

The problem lies in the section of the code where the values are retrieved from the received_body based on the field shape and type. The current implementation does not handle repeated keys correctly, leading to issues with validating and processing the input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data. The function should collect the repeated keys as a list and assign those values to the same key before validation occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from fastapi import Form, UploadFile, File
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.errors import ErrorWrapper
import asyncio
from copy import deepcopy

def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Form = File(...)
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Get list of values for the key
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected code, we use the `getlist` method to retrieve the list of values for a particular key in the form data. This ensures that the repeated keys are collected as a list, and then we validate and process them accordingly.

With this implementation, the function now supports repeated key-value pairs in form data and addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post. It properly collects the repeated keys and processes their values as lists, allowing for accurate validation and processing of input data.
