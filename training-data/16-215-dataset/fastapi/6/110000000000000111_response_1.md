1. The buggy function is designed to convert request body data into arguments for validation. The issue on GitHub is related to the inability to support repeated key=value pairs in form data, where the last key=value pair wins instead of being collected as a list for the same key. This indicates a problem with how the function processes form data and handles repeated keys.

2. The potential error location within the function is where it processes the form data and handles repeated keys. This is likely where the issue of only the last key=value pair winning is occurring.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not collecting repeated keys in the form data as a list, but instead only validating against the last value. This is in line with the GitHub issue's description of how FastAPI is currently handling repeated keys in form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the function to collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.
   - Adjusting the logic within the function to properly handle repeated keys in the form data and ensure they are collected as a list for the same key.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(value) == 1 and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                        value = value[0]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the logic for collecting repeated keys in the form data as a list and handling them appropriately has been adjusted to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
