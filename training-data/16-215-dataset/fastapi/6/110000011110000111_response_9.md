1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body and validating them against the required parameters. The failing test functions demonstrate that the function is not handling repeated keys in the form data correctly, resulting in a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The GitHub issue is related to the same problem, highlighting the issue of repeated keys in form data not being handled as a list when using FastAPI.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the `request_body_to_args` function. This is causing the function to not handle repeated keys as a list, leading to incorrect validation and status code errors.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not properly handling repeated keys in the form data, resulting in incorrect validation and status code errors in the failing test functions.
   (b). The failing test functions are indicating that the expected status code of 200 is not being achieved due to the issue with repeated keys in the form data.
   (c). The GitHub issue further confirms that the problem lies with the handling of repeated keys in form data and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign the values as a list to the same key before validation.
   - Update the validation logic to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data.
   - Ensure that the function processes repeated keys as part of the validation process and returns the correct status code.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected code, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign the values as a list to the same key before validation. This will ensure that the function passes the failing tests and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub.
