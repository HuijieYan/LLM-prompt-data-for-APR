1. The buggy function is designed to convert a request body into arguments based on the provided required parameters. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including the handling of the received body and the validation of the fields.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the function checks if the received body is not None and attempts to retrieve the value based on the field alias.

3. The bug's cause is related to the mishandling of the received body and the validation process, which could result in incorrect values being assigned to the fields and errors being improperly appended to the errors list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Revising the logic for retrieving values from the received body based on the field aliases.
   - Ensuring that the validation process accurately checks for errors and properly appends them to the errors list.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias, None)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and (value == "" or len(value) == 0)):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```
