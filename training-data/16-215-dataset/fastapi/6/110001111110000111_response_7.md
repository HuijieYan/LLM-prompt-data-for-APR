1. Analyzing the buggy function and its related components:
The function request_body_to_args is responsible for converting request body data into arguments for further processing. The failing test functions are testing the functionality of passing Python list, set and tuple as form data, but the function is not handling them correctly. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200, which means the request body is not being processed properly. The GitHub issue also describes a related problem with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.

2. Potential error location:
The potential error lies in how the function handles the conversion of form data to arguments, specifically in the part where it processes the data for sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples.

3. Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function does not correctly handle the conversion of form data for sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples.
(b). The failing test functions are passing sequence types in form data and expecting the correct processing, but the function is not handling them properly.
(c). The failing test and error message indicate that the response status code is incorrect, which suggests that the form data is not being processed as expected.
(d). The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, which suggests that the function may not be correctly handling such cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
(a). Update the function to correctly handle processing form data for sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples.
(b). Address the issue with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data as described in the GitHub issue.
(c). Ensure that the function properly validates and processes the form data for different types of input.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic import ModelField, ErrorWrapper, params, BaseConfig
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code addresses the handling of form data for sequence types and ensures that it correctly processes the input data. This updated function should now pass the failing test functions and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
