1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for parsing the received body and converting it into arguments based on the required parameters. The function checks for required parameters, retrieves values from the received body, handles missing values, and performs validation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it processes the received body to extract values for the required parameters and handle sequence shapes (multiple values for the same key).

3. (a). The buggy function is not properly handling repeated keys in form data and is only retrieving the last value, which does not align with the expectations of the user.
   (b). The GitHub issue highlights the problem where FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the function to collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.
   (b). Update the function to properly handle sequence shapes and form data with repeated keys to ensure all values are captured.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Updated to handle repeated keys as a list
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function is updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data by using `getlist()` to extract a list of values for a key. This aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
