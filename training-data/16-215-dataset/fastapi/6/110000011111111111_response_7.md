The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to parse and validate form data received as input. It processes a list of required parameters and the received form data, populates a `values` dictionary with the validated values, and appends any validation errors to the `errors` list.

The issue here is that the code is not handling repeated keys in the form data correctly. When the form data contains repeated keys, the function only considers the last value for each key, leading to incorrect validation results.

This bug is also identified in the failing test functions, where the expected output does not match the actual output due to the mishandling of repeated keys.

The GitHub issue posted indicates that the expected behavior should be to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys in the form data as lists, ensuring that all values for repeated keys are considered during validation.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if (
                field_info.shape in sequence_shapes
                and field_info.type_ != bytes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                value = list(value)
            elif (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field_info.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function properly handles repeated keys by using the `getlist` method for multi-valued keys. It also addresses the validation logic to correctly handle repeated keys as lists.

With this corrected code, the `request_body_to_args` function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
