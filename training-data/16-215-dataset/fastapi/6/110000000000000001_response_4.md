Potential Error Location: 

The potential error locations in the given function include:
1. The line `field_info = get_field_info(field)` is using `field_info`, which seems to be intended as `field_info = get_field_info(field)`.
2. There are other potential issues in the way the function is handling the `required_params` and `received_body`.
3. Additionally, there are multiple conditions and checks that may not be doing what they are intended to do, leading to potential bugs.

Bug's Cause:

The bug in the function seems to be caused by mishandling of `required_params` and `received_body`, as well as incorrect conditional logic and checks throughout the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Correct the assignment of `field_info` by making sure it is properly initialized using the `get_field_info` function.
2. Review and correct the conditional checks for `required_params` and `received_body`.
3. Ensure that the conditional logic used to validate and handle the values and errors is working as intended.

Corrected Code:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
                received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")

                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)

                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)

                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
