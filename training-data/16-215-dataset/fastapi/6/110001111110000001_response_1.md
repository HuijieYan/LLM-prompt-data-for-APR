The problematic function request_body_to_args is responsible for converting the values from the received_body into a dictionary and also capturing any errors during the process. The failing test cases indicate that the status code returned is 422 instead of the expected 200, and the JSON response is not as expected.

The bug is likely occurring due to the function not handling non-typing sequences properly. The failing tests indicate that for python-list, python-set, and python-tuple, the form data is not being processed correctly, leading to an incorrect status code and JSON response.

To fix the bug, the function request_body_to_args needs to be modified to properly handle the conversion of non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples, from the received body. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through each required parameter and properly retrieves the corresponding values from the received body, including handling non-typing sequences.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and produce the expected results.
