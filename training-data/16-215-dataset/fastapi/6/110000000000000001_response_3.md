1. The buggy function is designed to convert a request body into a dictionary of values and a list of errors, based on a list of required parameters and the received body. 

2. The potential error location within the function is in the validation and processing of the received body, as well as the handling of errors and values.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to issues in the logic for processing the received body and handling errors, which may result in incorrect values being assigned or errors not being properly handled.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the logic for processing the received body and ensuring that the correct values are extracted based on the field shape and type.
   - Properly handling errors by ensuring that they are added to the errors list and that values are assigned correctly based on the field requirements.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
from pydantic import ModelField, ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo, Shape, params
from pydantic.file_data import UploadFile
from pydantic.types import sequence_shapes, sequence_types, sequence_shape_to_type, lenient_issubclass
from copy import deepcopy
from starlette.datastructures import FormData
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the redundant variable re-assignment, ensured proper handling of errors, and improved the validation process for the received body to generate the correct values and errors.
