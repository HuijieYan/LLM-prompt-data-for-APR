1. The buggy function is a request handler that takes in a list of required parameters and a received request body. It then processes the request body to extract the values for the required parameters and validate them. The relationship with the GitHub issue is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data, which is causing only the last key=value pair to be processed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where it processes the received body to extract the values for the required parameters, especially when handling repeated keys in form data.

3. (a). The buggy function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly, causing only the last key=value pair to be processed.
   (b). The GitHub issue describes the problem of FastAPI not collecting repeated keys in form data and only validating against the last value, which aligns with the issue observed in the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve modifying the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. This could involve checking for repeated keys and then collecting and assigning the values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the issue:
```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass
from fastapi import Form

@dataclass
class FieldInfo:
    embed: Any

async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in ['list', 'tuple'] and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None and not field.required:
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    if field.required and value is None:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    elif field.required and value == "":
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        default_value = field.default
                        if value is None and default_value is not None:
                            values[field.name] = default_value
                        else:
                            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                                errors.append(errors_)
                            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                                errors.extend(errors_)
                            else:
                                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code now correctly handles repeated keys in form data by checking for this condition and using `getlist` to retrieve a list of values for the same key. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
