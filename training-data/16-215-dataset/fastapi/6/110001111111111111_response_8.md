The problem with the function is that it is only considering the last value of a repeated key in the FormData. To fix this issue, we need to update the function to collect and assign all the values of a repeated key to a list before validation.

The issue can be found in the section of the code where the function is checking for repeated keys in the FormData and retrieving the values. It then needs to modify the logic to handle repeated keys correctly.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling repeated keys in the FormData, leading to incorrect validation and error messages.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to collect all values of a repeated key in a list and then proceed with the validation. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are considered.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import UploadFile
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Form, BaseConfig
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union, Optional, Tuple
from fastapi.datastructures import FormData
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import (
    MissingError,
    ErrorWrapper,
    ModelField,
    get_field_info,
)

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in [1, 3] and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, Form)
                    and field.shape in [1, 3]
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in [1, 3]
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = [type(contents)(contents)]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle repeated keys in the FormData and provide the expected output in response to the failing tests.

The corrected code is designed to properly handle repeated keys in FormData and assign all values to a list for correct validation and error handling. This solution should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data.
