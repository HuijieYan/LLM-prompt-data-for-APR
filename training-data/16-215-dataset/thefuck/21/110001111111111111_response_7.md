The problem in the buggy function is with the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two parts when split by whitespace, which is not the case when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the `command.script` is equal to 'git' and then check if 'stash' is present in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (split_script[0] == 'git'
            and 'stash' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code first checks if the first word in `command.script` is 'git', and if 'stash' is present in `command.stderr`. This should fix the index out of range error and satisfy the failing test case provided.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to this bug.
