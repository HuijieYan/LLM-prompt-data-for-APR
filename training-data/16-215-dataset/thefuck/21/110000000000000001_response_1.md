1. The buggy function "match" takes in a command and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the function is the use of command.script.split()[1] without checking if the command has at least two words.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not check if the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word in the command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word
   - Handling cases where the command may not have enough words or the stderr may not be present

5. Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
