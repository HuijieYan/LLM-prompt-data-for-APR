The buggy function is a part of a package/module that provides a way to fix Git commands in the shell. The function is designed to match a command based on its script and stderr.

Based on the failing test and the provided runtime and expected value and type of variables, it can be identified that the issue is with the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. 

The problem is that the `command.script.split()` does not have enough elements for the index `[1]`. 

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to check if the split script has at least 2 parts before accessing the second part. This can be achieved using the following code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output variable information provided.
