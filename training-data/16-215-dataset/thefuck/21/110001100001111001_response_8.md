The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, it is not taking into account the actual words in the command, and only checking the script for 'stash' word.

The bug is caused by not correctly extracting the second word from the command script.

To fix this bug, we need to split the command script and then check if the second word is 'stash'. Additionally, we need to check if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
