The buggy function `match` is aimed at checking if the command script involves the keyword 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The bug causing the error is the following line of code: `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range," which means that the split() function is not finding a second element in the command.script.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split() function does not cause an IndexError. One possible approach would be to check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code ensures that the script is split into elements and then checks if there are at least two parts before comparing the second part to 'stash'. This approach should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
