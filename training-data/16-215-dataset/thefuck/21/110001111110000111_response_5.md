Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `command.script.split()[1]`.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script by space and is then attempting to access the second element of the resulting list. However, when the `command` object is created in the failing test, it only includes the `stderr` attribute and not `script`, which leads to the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to check if the second element exists before accessing it from the list.
2. Add a condition to check if the command script contains the word "stash" before splitting it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script
    if script and len(script.split()) > 1:
        return (script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
