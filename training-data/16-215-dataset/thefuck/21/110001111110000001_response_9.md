The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to split the command script and access the second element, assuming that it exists. However, if the script does not contain any spaces, or if it does not contain at least two elements after splitting, this will result in an `IndexError`.

The bug's cause is that the function is assuming the presence of a second element after splitting the command script, without checking for it.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If it's not, then the command does not match the condition and we can return False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2: 
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and the function will pass the failing test.
