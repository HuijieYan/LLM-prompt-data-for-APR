1. The buggy function is designed to match a command that includes 'stash' to fix a git issue. The provided GitHub issue describes a traceback error in the code that indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" when executing the function with the script "git".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line that splits the command's script and accesses the second element [1] without verifying if it exists.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to split the command's script and directly access the second element, assuming it exists.
   (b). The GitHub issue information shows the function being triggered with the script "git", which does not include the expected component to be accessed, leading to an IndexError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check to ensure that the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second one.
   - Handle the case where the script does not include the expected component in a different way to prevent the IndexError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
