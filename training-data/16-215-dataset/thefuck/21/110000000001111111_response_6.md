The issue in the buggy function is with the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line assumes that there will always be at least two elements in the split array, which is not the case when `command.script` is just 'git'.

The error occurs in the `git_fix_stash` rule when the command script is just 'git' and not 'git stash'. This causes the `command.script.split()[1]` to throw an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split array is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first checks the length of the split array and then accesses the second element. If the length is less than 2, it will return `False`, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
