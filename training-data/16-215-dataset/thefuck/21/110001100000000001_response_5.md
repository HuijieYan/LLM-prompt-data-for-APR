1. The buggy function is part of a git support module and is used to match a command for fixing a stash in the git repository.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition in the return statement. It checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

3. The bug's cause is that the current implementation of the function does not properly check for the "stash" command and "usage:" in the stderr. This can lead to incorrect matching and behavior of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the condition in the return statement to properly check for the "stash" command and "usage:" in the stderr.
   - Add error handling to account for different scenarios and edge cases.

5. Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.strip().split()
    return (len(script) > 1 
            and script[0] == 'git'
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected code, the function properly checks if the command script contains 'git stash' as well as if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. It also adds error handling by checking the length of the script to avoid potential index out of range errors.
