1. The buggy function 'match' is a decorator function with the '@git_support' decorator. It takes a 'command' parameter and tries to split the 'script' attribute of the command to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the 'stderr' attribute of the command. The failing test 'test_not_match' is trying to assert that the match function should not match a specific command. The error message indicates an 'IndexError' in the buggy function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely at the line 'command.script.split()[1]' where it tries to access the second element without checking if it exists.

3. (a). The buggy function: The buggy function tries to split the 'script' attribute of the command without verifying if it contains multiple elements.
   (b). The failing test and error message: The failing test is trying to assert that the match function should not match a specific command, and the error message indicates an 'IndexError' due to list index out of range.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the 'script' attribute of the command contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.
   - Handle cases where the 'script' attribute does not have the expected format.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected code ensures that it checks if the 'script' attribute has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This modification should address the 'IndexError' and make the function pass the failing test.
