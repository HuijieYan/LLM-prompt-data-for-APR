The potential error in the buggy function is with the use of the `split` method on the `command.script` without specifying any delimiter. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the input script has multiple words.

To fix this bug, we can split the script by spaces and then check if the second word is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
