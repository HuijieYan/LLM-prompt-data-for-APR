The buggy function is a decorator that is supposed to fix a specific git command, but it is currently failing with an IndexError. The failing test is checking whether the fix is being applied properly, but due to an off-by-one error in the `split` function, the function is trying to access an element of the list that doesn't exist.

The bug is caused by the `command.script.split()` line, which is splitting the script by spaces and then trying to access the second element of the resulting list, assuming it will always exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before we access the second one. We can also simplify the condition checking for the presence of 'stash' in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and 'stash' in script_parts and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
