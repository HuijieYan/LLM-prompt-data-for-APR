### Bug Analysis

The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` and then check if the second part is 'stash', while also checking if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates that an IndexError is being raised because the split operation doesn't return a second element in the list, resulting in an index out of range error.

The failing test `test_not_match` is failing as expected because of this IndexError.

The buggy function doesn't handle the case where `command.script` is only 'git', which results in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

The GitHub issue provides additional information about the failing rule and the error encountered.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function does not handle the scenario where `command.script` is only 'git', leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the split list contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, it should handle the case where `command.script` is only 'git' and adjust the conditions accordingly.

### Corrected Code

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False  # or any other appropriate handling for the 'git' case
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the split list contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. If the list length is less than 2, it returns False or any other appropriate handling for the 'git' case.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub by handling the 'git' case appropriately.
