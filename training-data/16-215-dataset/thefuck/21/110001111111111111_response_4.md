The issue is due to the fact that the function is assuming that the `command.script` will contain at least two elements when split. However, when the script is just `'git'`, splitting it will only result in a list with one element.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the `split()` result before accessing its elements, and also change the condition to check if the first element is 'stash'.

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('git')
def match(command):
    return (
        len(command.script.split()) > 1
        and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

By adding the check for the length of the split command, we ensure that we only access the elements if there are more than one. This will prevent the IndexError when the command is just `'git'`.
