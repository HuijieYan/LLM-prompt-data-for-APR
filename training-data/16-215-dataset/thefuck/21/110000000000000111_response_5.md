1. The buggy function is meant to check if a command matches the git "stash" syntax and if the output contains "usage:". However, the error indicates the function is trying to access an index that does not exist in the split command, leading to a list index out of range error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where the code attempts to access the second element of the split command, assuming it exists.

3. (a) The buggy function attempts to split the command script and compare the second element with 'stash'.
   (b) The GitHub issue information indicates that the code is trying to access an index that does not exist, leading to a list index out of range error.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to verify if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the "list index out of range" error from occurring.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and
            split_command[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code ensures that the split command has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This change should address the "list index out of range" error and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
