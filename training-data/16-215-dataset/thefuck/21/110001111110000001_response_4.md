The buggy function is using the `split` method on `command.script` without checking if it has any elements. This is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split result.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The cause of the bug is that the `split()` method is being called on `command.script` without checking if it has any elements after splitting. This results in an empty list, and trying to access the second element of an empty list causes an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` and then accessing the second element only if it exists, we can avoid the `IndexError` and ensure the function passes the failing test.
