1. The buggy function is a decorator function called "match" that takes a command as an argument and checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the condition for the return statement. There might be an issue with splitting the command script and checking for 'stash', as well as checking if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not properly handle cases where the command script does not have a second word, which causes an IndexError, and also does not handle cases where the stderr is not available.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle the IndexError when splitting the command script to check for the second word
   - Check if the stderr is not None before checking for 'usage:'

5. Corrected code:

```python
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        try:
            if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and command.stderr is not None and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        except IndexError:
            return False
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    return True
```
