The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists, which leads to an index out of range error. Additionally, the function only checks for the presence of "usage:" in the command stderr, which doesn't guarantee that the script is "git stash".

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script is "git" and the first argument is "stash" before splitting the command script.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1
        and script_parts[0] == 'git'
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This corrected function checks if the script contains at least two parts, the first of which is 'git' and the second is 'stash', before verifying the presence of 'usage:' in the command stderr. This implementation will fix the index out of range error and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
