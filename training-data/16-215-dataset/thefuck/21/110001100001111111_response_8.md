The bug is occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function is trying to split the `command.script` attribute and access the second element without first checking if the script is longer than one word. This causes an IndexError when the script is just "git".

The bug's cause is that the function assumes that the `script` attribute will always have more than one word. When the `script` attribute is "git", the split operation will result in a list of length 1, and accessing the second element will result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element is "git" before proceeding.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is as follows:
1. Check the length of the split operation on `command.script` before trying to access the second element.
2. Also, check if the first element of the split is "git" before proceeding.

The corrected code for the `match` function should look like this:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code checks the length of the split script and ensures that the first element is "git" before proceeding to access the second element. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
