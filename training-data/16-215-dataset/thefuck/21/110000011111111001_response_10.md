The problem with the current `match` function is that it tries to split `command.script` into multiple parts and then access the second part without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when `command.script` does not contain multiple parts. We can fix this by first checking if `command.script` contains multiple parts and then access the second part.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected function first splits the `command.script` into parts and checks if there are more than 1 part. If so, it performs the comparison and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns False.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
