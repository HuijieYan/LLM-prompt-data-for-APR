The issue with the current code is that it assumes that the input command.script will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace, which is not true in this case.

The bug occurs because when command.script is split, it results in only one element, so the attempt to access the second element with `command.script.split()[1]` raises an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the match function to check the command.script directly for the presence of 'stash' instead of splitting it and checking for the second element. We also need to check for the presence of 'usage:' in command.stderr to ensure that the error message indicates usage instructions for 'stash'.

Here is the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the match function should now pass the failing test and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
