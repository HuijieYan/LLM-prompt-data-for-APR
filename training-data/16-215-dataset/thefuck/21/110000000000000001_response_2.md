Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the use of the '@git_support' decorator, which is not defined or implemented in the provided code.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the missing implementation of the '@git_support' decorator, which is not provided in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define and implement the '@git_support' decorator so that it can be used as intended in the function.
2. Alternatively, remove the '@git_support' decorator and simply use the function without any decorator.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected code without the decorator
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
