The buggy function is using a decorator "git_support", which is not defined. This is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, the decorator should be removed and the function should be defined as a regular function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and
            command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
