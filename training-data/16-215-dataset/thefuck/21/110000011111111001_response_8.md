The bug is caused by the function trying to access the second index of the split command, which may not exist if the script does not have more than one word. This is what is causing the IndexError. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script has more than one word before trying to access the second index of the split command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will first check if the script has more than one word before trying to access the second index of the split command. This should fix the IndexError issue.
