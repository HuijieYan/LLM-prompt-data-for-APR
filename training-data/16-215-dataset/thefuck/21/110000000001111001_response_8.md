The potential error in the buggy function is with the comparison of the split command script. The function is comparing the second element of the split script to 'stash', and also checking if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the split script only contains one element in the given test case, leading to an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split script has at least two elements before trying to access the second one.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to first check if the command script starts with 'git' and then split the script to check the second element and also check if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.startswith('git'):
        split_script = command.script.split()
        return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
