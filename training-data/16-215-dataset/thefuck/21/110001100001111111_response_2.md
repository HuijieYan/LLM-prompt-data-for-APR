The problem in the buggy function is the assumption that the command.script will always contain at least two elements in the list returned by the split() method. However, when the script is just 'git', this assumption fails, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix this, we can modify the function to first check if the split() list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it doesn't, the function should return False. If it does, it should check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first splits the command.script and checks if the resulting list has at least 2 elements. If it does, it proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr. If any of these conditions fail, it returns False.

This should fix the issue described in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
