The buggy function is attempting to match a command that starts with "git stash" and has "usage:" in the stderr. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, specifically within the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not check if the `command.script.split()` list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split list has at least 2 elements before comparing the second index for 'stash'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if the split list has at least 2 elements before comparing the second index for 'stash', thus preventing the IndexError. This code should now pass the failing test.
