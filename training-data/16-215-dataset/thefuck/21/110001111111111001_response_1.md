The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` string by whitespace and then access the second element in the resulting list. However, if the `command.script` is just `'git'`, this will result in an `IndexError` because there is no second element in the list. 

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
