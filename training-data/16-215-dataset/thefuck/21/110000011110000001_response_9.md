1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to 'git stash' and if it contains 'usage:' in the stderr. However, the error message indicates an IndexError, which suggests that the `split()` method is trying to access an index that does not exist.

2. The potential error location within the `match` function is the `command.script.split()[1]` line, where the `split()` method is attempting to access the second element of the split result without checking if it exists.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and access the second element without checking the length of the resulting list, which causes the IndexError.
   (b) The failing test is trying to assert that the `match` function does not match a specific `Command` object, but it fails with an IndexError.

4. One approach for fixing the bug is to check the length of the result of `split()` before trying to access the second element. This can be done using an if statement to ensure that the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the `split_command` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring in the original buggy function.
