The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split() list of command.script even if the list is empty. This causes an IndexError when trying to access an element that doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split() function returns a non-empty list before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the split list `script_parts` has more than one element before accessing the second element to compare it with 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring before.

This corrected function will now satisfy the failing test case and the expected input/output variable information provided.
