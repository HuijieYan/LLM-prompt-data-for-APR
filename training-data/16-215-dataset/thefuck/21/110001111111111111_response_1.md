The problem with the buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the list returned by `split()` without checking if the list has at least that many elements. This causes an IndexError when the list has fewer elements than expected.

The fix for this is to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

def match(command):
    # Split the script by whitespace and check if the first word is 'git'
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash':
        # Check if the stderr contains 'usage:'
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue and the failing test case. The if statement first checks if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 to avoid the IndexError. Then it checks if the second word is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr.

This change should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It resolves the GitHub issue by fixing the bug that caused the IndexError.
