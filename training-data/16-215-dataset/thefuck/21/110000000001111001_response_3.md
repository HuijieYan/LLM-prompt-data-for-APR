The buggy function is trying to match the word 'stash' in the command.script and the presence of 'usage:' in the command.stderr. The potential error in the function is the use of split() without providing any arguments, which is causing the script to be split into individual characters instead of words.

The bug is causing the function to incorrectly identify the presence of 'stash' in the command.script. This is evident from the expected value of splited_script being ['git'] instead of ['usage:', 'git', 'stash', 'list', '[<options>]', 'or:', 'git', 'stash', 'show', '[<stash>]', 'or:', 'git', 'stash', 'drop', '[-q'].

To fix this bug, we can split the command.script using whitespace as the delimiter to properly separate the words in the script.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splited_script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
