The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `command` as input parameter, splits the `command.script` attribute and checks if the second element is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr` attribute. The error message indicates that an IndexError is being raised when trying to access the second element after splitting `command.script`.

The expected input parameters show that the `command.script` attribute is not being changed but the function is incorrectly splitting the string and attempting to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we should first check that the split results in at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we can convert the comparison to lowercase to be case-insensitive. 

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
