1. The buggy function is a decorator function called `git_support` that takes in a function `match` as an argument. The `match` function is supposed to check if the command passed in has the script 'stash' as the second word and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the `command.script.split()` is causing the issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]` where the program is attempting to access the second element of a list without checking if the list has at least that many elements.

3. The buggy function is failing because the `command.script.split()[1]` is causing an IndexError due to the fact that the `command.script.split()` does not have a second index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the `command.script.split()` has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.
   - Ensure that the function handles cases where there may not be a second word in the command script.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code first checks if the split `command.script` has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. If it does, it proceeds to check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. This should fix the `IndexError` issue and make the function pass the failing test.
