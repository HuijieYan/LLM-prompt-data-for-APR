The potential error in the buggy function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to split the `command.script` by whitespace and then access the second element, assuming that there will always be more than one word in `command.script`. However, the error message indicates that this assumption is not always true, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we can check if the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash', which is the intended behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git' 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if the `command.script` contains at least two elements, and then verifies that the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash'. This should fix the `IndexError` issue and make the function pass the failing test.
