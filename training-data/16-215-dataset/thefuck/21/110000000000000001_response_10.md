1. The buggy function checks if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the command stderr.

2. The potential error location within the function is the use of `command.script.split()[1]`. If the `split()` method doesn't return a list with at least two elements, it will cause an index out of range error.

3. The bug is caused by the assumption that the `split()` method will always return a list with at least two elements, which may not always be the case.

4. To fix the bug, we can check the length of the split list before accessing the second element to avoid index out of range errors. We can also check if the `stderr` attribute is not None before checking for the presence of "usage:".

5. Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and command.stderr is not None and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
