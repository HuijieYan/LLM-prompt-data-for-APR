The bug in the given function is that it is trying to access the 2nd index of the split script without checking if the length of the split script is greater than 1.

The potential error location within the problematic function is on this line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The bug is caused due to the assumption that command.script.split() will always have at least 2 elements, causing an IndexError when this is not the case.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split script has at least 2 elements before accessing the 2nd index. We also need to check if 'stash' is present in the split script before proceeding with further checks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

The corrected function checks if the split script has at least 2 elements and if the 2nd element is 'stash'. If both conditions are met, it checks if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns False.

This corrected function will pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
