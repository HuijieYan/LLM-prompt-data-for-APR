The problem lies in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. The error `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that `command.script.split()` does not contain enough elements to access the element at index 1. This leads to the function trying to access a non-existent element and causes an IndexError.

The failing test provides the expected input parameter values:
- `command.script` is `'git'`
- `command.stderr` contains the usage information for the git stash command

The expected condition in the failing test is that the `match` function should return `False` for these input parameters.

Considering the condition in the `match` function (`command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`), it tries to access the second word in the `command.script`, which is unnecessary since the intention is to check if the script is equal to `'git stash'`. The function does not have to split the `command.script` to accomplish this.

Additionally, the condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` aligns with the purpose of the `match` function, so it should remain unchanged.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to be modified to:
1. Check if the `command.script` starts with `'git stash'`.
2. Check if the string `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`.

The corrected function is as follows:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
