The buggy function is a part of a rule for thefuck, a tool for correcting mistyped console commands. The function is supposed to match commands that have the 'git stash' substring in the script and 'usage:' in the stderr.

The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a list index out of range error in the `match` function of the file `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py`. This error occurs when trying to access the second element of the result of the `split()` method on `command.script`, indicating that the script is not formatted as expected.

The GitHub issue title and description further clarify that the rule fails when the script is just 'git' and the error is due to the attempt to access the second element of the split result.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain the expected substring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This modification first checks if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the list index out of range error. With this change, the function should now successfully pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
