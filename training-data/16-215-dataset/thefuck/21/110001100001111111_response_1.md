The problem with the current function is that it assumes the script will always have at least 2 elements after splitting it by spaces. This is not a safe assumption.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the script does not contain the word "stash".

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. Then we can check if the second element is "stash".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code will handle the case where the script is just "git" and will not cause an IndexError. It should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
