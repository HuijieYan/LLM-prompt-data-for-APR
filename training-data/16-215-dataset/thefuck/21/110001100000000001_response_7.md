1. The buggy function is a part of a larger codebase that includes other functions related to git commands. The function is trying to match a specific git command (stash) and check for a specific error message ('usage:') in the stderr. 

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement that checks for the presence of 'stash' in the command script and 'usage:' in the command stderr.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect use of the split() method on the command script and the conditional checks. The function is not handling potential errors or edge cases that could lead to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Adding error handling to check for any potential issues with the split() method or accessing the script and stderr properties of the command.
   b. Improving the conditional checks to ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and 'stash' in command.script.split()[1] and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the split command has more than 1 element to avoid potential index out of range errors. Then we check if 'stash' is present in the split script and 'usage:' is present in the stderr. If all conditions are met, we return True, otherwise, we return False.
