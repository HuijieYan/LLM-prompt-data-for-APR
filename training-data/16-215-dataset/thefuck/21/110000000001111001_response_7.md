The potential error in the function is the incorrect comparison of the split command.script with 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

The bug's cause is that the function is currently only checking if 'stash' is the second word in command.script and if 'usage:' is present in command.stderr. However, it should be checking if 'stash' is the second word in command.script.split().

To fix the bug, we need to split the command.script and then perform the comparison. We also need to correctly compare the command.stderr to check for the presence of 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This function now correctly splits the command.script and checks if 'stash' is the second word. It also checks if 'usage:' is present in command.stderr. With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
