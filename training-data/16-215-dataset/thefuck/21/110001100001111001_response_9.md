The problem with the buggy function is that it is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash', and if the command's stderr contains 'usage:'. However, in the provided testcase, the second word in the command is 'git', not 'stash', so the function will always return False. 

To fix this, we need to check if 'stash' is in the command script and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now return True for the provided test case, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
