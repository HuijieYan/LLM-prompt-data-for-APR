The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` by spaces and check if the second element is `'stash'`. However, in this case, `command.script` only contains one element which causes the index out of range error.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This code first splits the script and then checks if the length is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, it returns False.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information as well as resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
