The buggy function is a decorator function `@git_support` that takes in a `command` as a parameter and returns whether the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error is being caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` which is trying to access the second word in `command.script` without checking if the length of the split is greater than 1.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to first check if the length of the split is greater than 1 before accessing the second word. If the length is greater than 1, then we can check if the second word is 'stash'.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected function will now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
