1. The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the given command is a git stash command. The GitHub issue mentions that when the command is just `git`, the `git_fix_stash` rule fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This indicates that the buggy function is trying to split the command without checking if the split result contains enough elements.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where the split result is accessed without checking its length.

3. (a). The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element of the split result without checking if there are at least two elements.
   (b). The GitHub issue information clearly shows that the error occurs when the command is just `git`, which will result in the split result containing only one element, leading to the `IndexError`.

4. To fix the bug, the potential approaches could be:
   - Check the length of the split result before trying to access its elements.
   - Handle the case where the split result does not contain enough elements.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the command is 'git' with no additional arguments
    if command.script.strip() == 'git':
        return False
    # Split the command and check if the second element is 'stash'
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected code checks if the command is just `git` and returns `False` to avoid the `IndexError`. It also checks the length of the split result before trying to access its elements. This modification should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
