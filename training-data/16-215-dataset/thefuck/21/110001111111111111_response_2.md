The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` string and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, this is causing an `IndexError` if there is no second element in the split result. This is evident in the failing test where the `command.script` is 'git' and the function is attempting to access `split()[1]`. 

The code needs to be fixed to account for the possibility that the `command.script` may not have a second element after splitting.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return False.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, it will return False, which resolves the `IndexError` issue.
