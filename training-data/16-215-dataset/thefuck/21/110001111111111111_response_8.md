The problem with the buggy function is that it tries to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without first checking if it contains at least two elements. This causes an IndexError when the split result is shorter than expected.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split result before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the split result contains at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the GitHub issue.
