1. The buggy function seems to be a part of a rules file for the `thefuck` tool, specifically for the `git_fix_stash` feature.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `return` statement, where it checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

3. The bug's cause is that the function only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, but it doesn't consider the actual error message or output from the git command. This could lead to incorrect matching and subsequent incorrect fix suggestions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the condition to check for the specific error message related to incorrect usage of the git stash command.
   - Use regular expressions to accurately match the command and error message.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        # Check for the specific error related to usage of git stash
        error_pattern = re.compile(r"(error: )|(fatal: )")
        if error_pattern.search(command.stderr):
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. Then, we use a regular expression to look for specific error messages related to the incorrect usage of the git stash command. If such an error is found, we return `True` indicating a match for the rule, otherwise, we return `False`.
