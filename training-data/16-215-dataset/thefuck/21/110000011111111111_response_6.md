It seems like the buggy function `match` is trying to check if the first word of `command.script` is 'stash' and also if the word 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The reported error is "IndexError: list index out of range" which indicates that the `command.script` does not have any whitespace.

The reported GitHub issue further confirms this by stating the error "IndexError: list index out of range".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to first check if the `command.script` contains 'git' before splitting it and accessing the second word. Then, ensure that 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. 

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'git' in command.script:
        return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

By checking if 'git' is in the `command.script` before accessing the second word and making use of the length check, we can avoid the IndexError. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
