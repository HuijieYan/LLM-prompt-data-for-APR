# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The bug was fixed by adding a check to ensure that the `command.script` has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This prevents the "IndexError: list index out of range" from occurring.
