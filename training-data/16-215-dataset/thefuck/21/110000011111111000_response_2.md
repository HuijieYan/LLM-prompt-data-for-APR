To fix the buggy function, we need to update the logic to handle the case when the command.script.split() list has less than 2 elements. We can also add a check to ensure that the split command strings and the desired elements are present in the command.script and command.stderr respectively. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this fixed version, we check if the split_script list has more than one element before attempting to access split_script[1]. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring in the failing test case. Additionally, we include a condition to check for the presence of 'usage:' in command.stderr to ensure that both conditions are met before returning True.

After making these changes, the function should now handle the failing test case correctly and provide the expected output.
