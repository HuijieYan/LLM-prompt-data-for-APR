The potential error in the buggy function is the usage of the split() method without any arguments. This will split the command.script string by whitespace, resulting in a list of strings, and it seems the intention is to check the second word in the script.

The cause of the bug is that the split method splits the string command.script into a list with a single element, which is the entire script. Therefore, the comparison (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash') will always be False.

To fix this bug, we need to split the command.script by whitespace and then check if the second word is 'stash'.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By making this change, the function will properly split the script and check if the second word is 'stash', which should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
