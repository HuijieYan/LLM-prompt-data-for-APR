The problem with the `match` function is that it assumes the `command.script` will have at least two components if split by a space. However, in this case, `command.script` is just `'git'`, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element after splitting.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least two before performing the comparison. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the match function checks if the split_script has at least 2 elements before performing the comparison. This should prevent the IndexError and make the failing test pass.
