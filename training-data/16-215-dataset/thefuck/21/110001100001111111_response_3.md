The problem with the buggy function is that it assumes the second word in the command script is always 'stash'. However, in the input provided, the command script is 'git', so when it tries to split the script into words and access the second word, it results in an IndexError.

To fix this, we need to check if the first word in the command script is 'git', and if the second word is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

Here's the fixed code for the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('git')
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and
            script_words[0] == 'git' and
            script_words[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly identify whether the command is a 'git stash' command and if there is an error message indicating the correct usage. This updated code satisfies the expected input/output variables and should resolve the GitHub issue.
