Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring at the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, where the code is trying to access the second element of the split command.script, but it is failing when there is no second element.

Bug's cause: The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command.script without checking if it exists, leading to an IndexError when there is no second element.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to make sure that the script has at least two words after splitting before trying to access the second word.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    scripts = command.script.split()
    return (len(scripts) > 1 and scripts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there are at least two words after splitting `command.script` before trying to access the second word. This should fix the IndexError issue and make the function pass the failing test. This also solves the GitHub issue by ensuring that the function doesn't encounter an IndexError when there is no second word in the split command.script.
