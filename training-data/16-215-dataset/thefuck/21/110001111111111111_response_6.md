The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to split the `command.script` using whitespace and then accessing the second element without checking if it exists. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the split command does not result in a list with at least two elements in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command results in a list with at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the split command results in a list with at least two elements.
2. If so, then check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
3. Return True if both conditions are met, otherwise return False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('git')
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code checks if the split `command.script` has at least two elements. If it does, then it checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
