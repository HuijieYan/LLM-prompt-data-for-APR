1. The buggy function `match` is being decorated with `@git_support`, which suggests that it is intended to be used for Git-related commands. The failing test is checking if the function does not match a specific command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the function, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]`.

2. The potential error is occurring in the `command.script.split()[1]` statement, where it is attempting to access the second element of the split result, assuming that there are at least two elements. This assumption is likely causing the `IndexError` when the split result has fewer than two elements.

3. (a) The buggy function attempts to split the `command.script` by spaces and then access the second element without considering the possibility of there being fewer elements.
   (b) The failing test is trying to assert that the `match` function does not match a specific command. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurs at the `command.script.split()[1]` line, pointing to the cause of the failure.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the length of the split result before accessing its elements to avoid `IndexError`.
   - Verify that the command is a valid `git` command before attempting to split it.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@git_support
@for_app('git')
def match(command):
    if command.script and 'stash' in command.script:
        split_script = command.script.split()
        return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
