# The fixed version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the fixed version, I added an additional condition to check if the command starts with 'git' and also fixed the index for splitting the command script.
