1. The provided buggy function is a decorator `git_support` that is used to decorate the `match` function. The `match` function takes a command as input and checks if the script in the command contains the word 'stash' at the second position and if 'usage:' is present in the command's `stderr`. The failing test checks if the `match` function returns `False` when provided with a specific `Command` input. The error message indicates an `IndexError` in the `match` function when trying to access the second split element of the script in the command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This line tries to access the second item of the split command script, which can lead to an `IndexError` if the script does not contain enough elements after splitting.

3. (a) The buggy function tries to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists, leading to the `IndexError`.
   (b) The failing test checks if the `match` function returns `False` when provided with a specific `Command` input, which it does not due to the `IndexError`.
   (c) The GitHub issue details the error message and the traceback indicating the `IndexError` in the `match` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check if the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.
   - Modify the condition to handle cases where the script may not contain enough elements after splitting.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected code, the script is split and stored in a variable `split_script`, and then the condition is modified to first check if the split script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
