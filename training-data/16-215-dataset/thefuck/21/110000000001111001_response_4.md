The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `split()` without specifying a delimiter. This causes the function to split the string by whitespace, resulting in `splited_script` being `['git']` instead of `['usage:', 'git', 'stash']`. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is checking if the second element of the split command script is equal to 'stash', which is not the case.

To fix the bug, we need to split the command script by whitespace and then check if 'stash' is in the split list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code fixes the bug by properly checking if 'stash' is in the split command script. This solution satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
