1. The buggy function `match` takes a `Command` object as input, checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. It is used with the `@git_support` decorator.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which tries to access the second word in the script without checking if it exists.

3. The bug is caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` line, which is attempting to access the second word in the command script without ensuring that it exists. This results in an IndexError when the script doesn't contain at least two words. The failing test is trying to match a command that does not have the word 'stash' in it, causing the function to throw an IndexError due to trying to access a second element in an empty list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the script contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word.
   - Add a condition to check if the script contains the word 'git' and 'stash' before proceeding with the other checks.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```
