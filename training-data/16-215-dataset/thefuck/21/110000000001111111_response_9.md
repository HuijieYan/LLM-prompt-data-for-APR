The function match has a decorator @git_support, which is likely to be the cause of the issue. The actual bug is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists, resulting in an IndexError when the command is only 'git'.

The expected value and type of the parameters during the failing test execution match the actual values, and the GitHub issue indicates that the problem occurs when the script is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, the split command should be wrapped with a check for the length of the split list such that it does not cause an IndexError.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the split command has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This revision should resolve the issue and satisfy the provided input/output variable information.
