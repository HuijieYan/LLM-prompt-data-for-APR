The buggy function is supposed to check for a specific condition based on the input command, specifically if the command's script is 'git' and the command's stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the function is improperly checking the second element of the split command.script for 'stash' without first ensuring that there is a second element.

The error location is at the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` where it is trying to access the second element of the split command.script without checking that it exists.

The bug's cause is the assumption that the split command.script has at least two elements without verifying it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the length of the split command.script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.
2. Update the condition to ensure that the 'stash' condition check only happens when there are at least two elements in the split command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and 
            splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected function checks if the length of the split command.script is more than 1, and then it checks the second element for 'stash' to prevent the 'IndexError' that was occurring before. This code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
