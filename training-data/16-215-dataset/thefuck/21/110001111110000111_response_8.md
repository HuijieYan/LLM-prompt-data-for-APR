The buggy function is `match` and it is decorated with `@git_support`. The failing test checks if the match function returns false when the input command is "git" and the stderr is equal to `git_stash_err`. The error message indicates that the error occurs at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file where the `IndexError: list index out of range` is raised.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script.split()` is trying to access the index 1 without checking if the split function actually returns any values. This causes the IndexError when the split function doesn't return any value.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split function indeed returns a value before accessing index 1.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code first splits the command script and stores it in `script_parts`. Then it checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing index 1 to avoid the IndexError. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
