The buggy function 'match' is using the split() function on the command.script without checking if it actually contains any values after splitting. This is causing the 'IndexError: list index out of range' error, as there might not be a second element after splitting.

The failing test is checking if the match function does not match a specific Command object, and it's failing with the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split command actually produces at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for the length of the split list before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element, which should fix the IndexError issue.
