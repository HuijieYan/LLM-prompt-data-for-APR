The buggy function `match` is attempting to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, the function is throwing an error because it's assuming the `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is not the case.

The bug is being caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two words, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the list created by `split()`. This expectation is not consistent with the actual input where `command.script` is 'git', causing the split to return only one element in the list.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the function checks the length of the split `command.script` before trying to access the second word, preventing the `IndexError` when the script has only one word. With this fix, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
