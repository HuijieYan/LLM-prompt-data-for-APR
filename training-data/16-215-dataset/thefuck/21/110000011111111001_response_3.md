The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it assumes the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter can be split into multiple elements, which is not always the case. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that doesn't exist in the split list.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the `script` attribute contains the word 'stash' at all before trying to split it.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function checks if the word 'stash' is present in the `script` attribute of the `command` object before checking for 'usage:' in the `stderr` attribute. This ensures that the function will not throw an `IndexError` and passes the failing test.
