It appears that the bug in the `match` function is due to the assumption that the input `command.script` will always contain multiple words. The code tries to split `command.script` and access the second element without checking if it exists. This causes the function to fail when `command.script` contains only a single word, as in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that `command.script` contains multiple words before trying to access the second element after splitting. We can do this by checking the length of the split result.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check if the second word of `command.script` is 'stash' before attempting to access it.

This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub error message.
