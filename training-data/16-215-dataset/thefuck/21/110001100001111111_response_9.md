The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the `split()` list of the `command.script` without checking if it exists. This is causing an `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the `split()` result is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if there are at least 2 parts in the `split()` result before trying to access the second index, thus preventing the `IndexError`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
