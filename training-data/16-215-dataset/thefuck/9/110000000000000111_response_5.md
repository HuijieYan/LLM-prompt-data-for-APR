1. The buggy function is supposed to remove the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments from the command string. It then extracts the push destination from the stderr output of the command and replaces the push command with the correct upstream option.

The GitHub issue is related to the incorrect behavior of the function in suggesting the correct git push command with the upstream option.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments. The current implementation removes the options but does not consider their arguments and may not handle multiple occurrences of these options correctly.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments. The function is not correctly identifying and removing the arguments associated with these options. This leads to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

4. To fix the bug, one approach would be to correctly identify the option and its argument, then remove both from the command string. This can be achieved by finding the index of the option, checking if the next element is its argument, and then removing both elements. Additionally, the extraction of the push destination from stderr should be improved to handle different stderr outputs.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their arguments
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if opt in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            if index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the option
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove its argument
    
    # Extract push destination from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle case where stderr format is unexpected
        return command.script
```

This corrected function properly removes the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments. It also improves the extraction of the push destination from stderr to handle different stderr outputs. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
