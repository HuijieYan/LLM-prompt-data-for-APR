The buggy function is attempting to detect the presence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags in the command and remove them, and then extract the suggested git command from the stderr and replace the 'push' argument in the command with it. However, it has a critical logic error.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect usage of the pop function. The issues are occurring because the function wrongly assumes that both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present and may not be contiguous, but the second pop operation removes the wrong item if both options are present.

To fix the bug, we can use the remove function instead of pop to remove all instances of '--set-upstream' or '-u' from the list of commands. Additionally, the correct index for push_upstream can be retrieved without relying on the specific position of 'git' in the stderr.

Here is the corrected code for the function that satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u
    command.script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
