The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the upstream option from the `command.script_parts` list. The function is only checking for the presence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`, but it does not consider the situation where both may be present in the script_parts list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the upstream option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to update the logic for extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Remove the upstream option and its argument
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the push_upstream value from the stderr
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = next((line.partition('git ')[2] for line in lines if 'git push' in line), None)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Additionally, the fix should resolve the issue posted on the GitHub repository related to bug #538 and ensure that suggestions for `git push -u origin` work correctly.
