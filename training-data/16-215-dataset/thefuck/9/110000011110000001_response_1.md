1. The buggy function is designed to remove the "--set-upstream" and "-u" options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list and then retrieve the "push upstream" value from the stderr of the command. The buggy function then returns a modified version of the command by replacing the "push" command with the retrieved "push upstream" value.

2. The potential error location within the function is the removal of items from the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code is attempting to pop items from the `command.script_parts` list at the index returned by `index` method, which results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. This is evident from the failing test and the error message that specifically points to the `IndexError` in the `pop` operation within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if the index obtained from the `index` method is within the range of the list before attempting to remove items using the `pop` method.
   b. Handle the case where the index is not found without producing an error.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks for the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately, and if found, it removes them from `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, it uses exception handling to ignore the `ValueError` if the index is not found. This ensures that the `pop` operation will only be performed if the index is valid and prevents the `IndexError` that was occurring in the buggy function.
