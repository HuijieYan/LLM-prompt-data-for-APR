The potential error location within the problematic function is where the `upstream_option_index` is being used to pop elements from `command.script_parts`. The `upstream_option_index` is not being considered correctly in the code, which results in an `IndexError: pop index out of range` error.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is not being handled properly in the code. This causes it to be an out of range index when trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.

To fix the bug, we can change the code to ensure that the index is being correctly found and used to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. We should also consider handling the case when the index is not found in the array.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should handle the issue with the index being out of range and should pass the failing test case. It also addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
