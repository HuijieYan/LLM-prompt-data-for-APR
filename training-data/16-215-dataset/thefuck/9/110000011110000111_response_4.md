The problem with the buggy function `get_new_command` is that it is not correctly removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This results in an IndexError when trying to pop the already removed index, as indicated by the error message.

The failing test is highlighting the issue by showing that the function is not producing the expected output for commands with `-u` or `--set-upstream` options.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the function is not providing the correct suggestions for `git push -u` commands.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Then it should construct the new command string using the corrected `command.script_parts` and replacing the 'push' argument with the appropriate upstream branch.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function correctly checks for the presence of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and removes them from `command.script_parts` if they are present. It then constructs the new command string using the corrected `command.script_parts` and replaces the 'push' argument with the appropriate upstream branch.

This corrected function should resolve the failing test and provide the correct suggestions for `git push -u` commands, as indicated in the GitHub issue.
