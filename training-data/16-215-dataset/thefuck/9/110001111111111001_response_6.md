The bug in the provided function is caused by attempting to pop an index out of range from the `command.script_parts` list. This occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 but the if condition still executes the pop operation.

To fix this issue, we can simply add a check to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to pop the index.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # ensure index is still valid
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code will now check that the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to pop the index, and it will also check if the index is still within the valid range of the list. This should resolve the IndexError and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
