The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to process a `git push` command and modify it based on the stderr message received. The failing test for this function is checking for different variations of the `git push` command and their expected modified outputs. The error message indicates an IndexError when trying to pop an element from an empty list.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` where it is trying to pop an element from the list without checking if the index is out of range.

The bug is caused by the function trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list using an index that is out of range. This occurs because the function is not handling the case where the index `-1` is assigned to `upstream_option_index`, indicating that the option was not found in the `command.script_parts` list. 

To fix this bug, we need to check for the value of `upstream_option_index` before trying to remove elements using `pop`. If the index is not `-1`, then we can proceed to remove the elements.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if index is not -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts`.

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should pass the failing test and also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
