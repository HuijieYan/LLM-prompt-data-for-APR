The buggy function `get_new_command(command)` is supposed to manipulate a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and then replacing the `push` argument with the actual upstream branch name. However, the function currently has a bug with index out of range, which is causing the failing test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `pop` method, as it is trying to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if the index is within the range of the list.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is being used twice without properly handling the index out of range possibility, which leads to the IndexError.

To fix the bug, possible approaches include:
1. Checking if `upstream_option_index` is within the range of the list before using it with the `pop` method.
2. Using a conditional statement to remove the element only if it exists in the list.
3. Ensuring that the list is not empty before popping elements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and (upstream_option_index + 1) < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
