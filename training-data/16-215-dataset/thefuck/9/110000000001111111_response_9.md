The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to parse the `command` object and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`, and then retrieve the suggested git command from the `stderr` and replace the `push` command with the retrieved suggested command.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values show that the function is not handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly, and is not properly retrieving the suggested git command from the `stderr`.

The GitHub issue indicates that the function is not providing the correct suggestion when using `git push -u <remote>`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`, and then properly retrieve the suggested git command from the `stderr`.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-3:]
    return ' '.join(['git'] + push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should satisfy all the provided input/output variable information and provide the correct suggestions for the `git push -u` command as described in the GitHub issue.
