Potential Error Location:
The error occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` when `upstream_option_index` is equal to -1.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function is trying to remove the elements at the index `upstream_option_index`, which is incorrectly set to -1 initially. This causes the error when trying to pop an element from the script_parts list at an index that is out of range.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize `upstream_option_index` to None instead of -1.
2. Check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before popping the element from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = None  # Initialize to None
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not None:  # Check for None instead of -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code initializes `upstream_option_index` to None and checks for it before popping the elements from the list. This should fix the IndexError seen in the failing test. It should also address the issue posted on GitHub in the provided detailed description.
