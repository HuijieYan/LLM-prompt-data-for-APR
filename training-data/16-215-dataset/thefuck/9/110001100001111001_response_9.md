The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is present in the command. It incorrectly removes the option and its argument from the script_parts list, and then tries to extract the push_upstream value from command.stderr, which is unreliable and not a good approach.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the presence of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option in the command.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    new_command = ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    if '--set-upstream' in new_command:
        new_command = new_command.replace('--set-upstream', '')
    if '-u' in new_command:
        new_command = new_command.replace('-u', '')
    
    return new_command
```

This corrected function should now handle the presence of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option in the command correctly, and it should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
