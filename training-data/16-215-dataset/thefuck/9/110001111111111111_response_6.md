The problematic function is `get_new_command` from the file `git_push.py`. The bug occurs in the logic that tries to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts`. The issue is that when the pop method is used to remove the index of those elements, there is an `IndexError` because the index might not exist in the list.

The failing test is expecting the `push_upstream` to be returned without the `--quiet` argument, and for `git push -u` to be transformed into `git push --set-upstream origin master`. However, the function is not handling the `--quiet` argument correctly and is not transforming `-u` to `--set-upstream origin master` as expected.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the `--quiet` argument correctly, and remove the `-u` flag and its argument and then append `--set-upstream origin master` to the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument of -u
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[4]  # Extract the push command from the stderr
    return 'git push --set-upstream ' + push_upstream
```

This corrected function handles both `--set-upstream` and `-u` correctly, removes any argument, and appends `--set-upstream origin master` to the command.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue that was posted to GitHub.
