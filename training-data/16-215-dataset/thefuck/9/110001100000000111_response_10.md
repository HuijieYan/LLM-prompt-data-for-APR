The buggy function is related to the git_push.py file and is designed to handle the git push command. The function is meant to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and their arguments from the command, and then suggest a corrected git push command.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the code that attempts to find the index of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and then removes them from the command. The error seems to be in the way the index of the options is being found and then removed from the list of script parts in the command.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command, leading to incorrect suggestions for the corrected git push command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Properly identifying the index of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the command and removing them from the list of script parts.
2. Ensuring that the function accurately captures the necessary information from the git push command to suggest the corrected version.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should accurately identify and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the git push command and suggest the correct version. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
