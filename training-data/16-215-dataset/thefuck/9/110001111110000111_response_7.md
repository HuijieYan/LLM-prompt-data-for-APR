The bug is located in the get_new_command function within the git_push.py file. The function is trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command, as well as its argument, but it is not handling the case where both are present properly. This is causing an IndexError when trying to pop the elements from the list.

The failing test is trying to check if the get_new_command function can handle different variations of the 'git push' command and provide the correct new command based on the stderr passed to it.

The GitHub issue #558 details the incorrect behavior of the function when 'git push -u' is used, and issue #538 also references this bug.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options are present in the command. It should also extract the push_upstream value from the stderr in a way that can handle different error messages.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    modified_command = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in modified_command:
        upstream_option_index = modified_command.index('--set-upstream')
        modified_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
        modified_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in modified_command:
        upstream_option_index = modified_command.index('-u')
        modified_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(modified_command) > upstream_option_index:  # check if there is an argument after the -u option
            modified_command.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[-2:]  # extract the push upstream value from stderr
    return replace_argument(" ".join(modified_command), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))  # join the modified command back together
```

With this corrected code, the get_new_command function should now handle the different variations of the 'git push' command correctly and provide the new command as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
