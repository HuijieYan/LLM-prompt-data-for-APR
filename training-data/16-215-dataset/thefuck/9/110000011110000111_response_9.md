The buggy function `get_new_command` is throwing an `IndexError` in the event that the command passed to it does not contain the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. 

The failing test function `test_get_new_command` is trying to test the behavior of `get_new_command` when different variations of `git push` commands are passed to it. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` is occurring at line 32 of the code, where the `pop` method is used on `command.script_parts`.

The GitHub issue #538 mentions that the suggestion for `git push -u myfork` is incorrect and should be `git push --set-upstream myfork`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, it should be able to handle cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the command. The function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
