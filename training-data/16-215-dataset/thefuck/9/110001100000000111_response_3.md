Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their respective arguments from the command, as these options are concatenated onto the command suggested by git. However, the function is incorrectly trying to remove the options and their arguments by using the index of the script_parts, but it doesn't handle the case where both options are present in the command.

Additionally, the function is using the wrong method to get the push_upstream value, as it is splitting the stderr and getting the third last line. This approach is not reliable and can lead to incorrect values.

The GitHub issue indicates that the command 'git push -u <argument>' is not being suggested correctly after a particular merge (#538).

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of removing '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments, and the incorrect method used for obtaining push_upstream value. This causes the wrong suggestion to be provided after the git push -u command is run.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using try-except blocks for each option, use one if-else block to check for both options.
2. Use a more reliable method to obtain the push_upstream value.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Get the push_upstream value from the last line of stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-1].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code resolves the issue by properly handling the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments and obtaining the push_upstream value in a more reliable way. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
