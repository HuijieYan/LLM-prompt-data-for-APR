1. The buggy function is intended to modify the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and replacing it with the output of the `git push` command. The failing test is testing the function's behavior with different variations of the `git push` command and comparing the expected output with the actual output.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the section where it attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

3. The bug's cause is due to the fact that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the list, it is then being attempted to remove the same index again, which causes an `IndexError` as seen in the error message. The failing test highlights this issue by testing different variations of the `git push` command and shows that the function incorrectly handles the removal of the `-u` option.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the index to be removed is still in the list before attempting to remove it.
   - Refactoring the code to handle the removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options more effectively.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options correctly, passing the failing test.
