Potential error location: The buggy function is attempting to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments from the list of command script parts, but it is not removing both the argument and its associated value. This is causing the incorrect output in the git push command suggestions.

Bug's cause: The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly removing both the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command script parts, leading to incorrect suggestions in the git push command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to properly remove both the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command script parts.
2. Ensure that the correct push upstream value is extracted from the command.stderr and used in the suggestion.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# The corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the value

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly remove both the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command script parts, and the correct push upstream value will be used in the command suggestion, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
