1. The buggy function is a part of a script related to Git commands. It is supposed to handle the git push command and remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the command if they are present. It then extracts the upstream branch from the stderr and replaces the argument 'push' with the extracted upstream branch.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options from the command.

3. The bug's cause is that the code does not properly handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options from the command. The index of the options to be removed is being incorrectly determined, and the script_parts are not being updated correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use a more reliable method to determine the index of the options to be removed from the script_parts.
   b. Ensure that the script_parts are updated correctly after removing the options.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, the method for determining the index of --set-upstream or -u options has been updated to handle both cases properly. Additionally, the condition for checking if the index is not -1 has been corrected, and the script_parts are updated after removing the options.
