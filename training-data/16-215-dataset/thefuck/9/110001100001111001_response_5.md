The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by incorrect indexing when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. The function is only removing the first instance found, but there could be multiple instances in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the command is not being reconstructed correctly after the removal of these options.

To fix the bug, we will find and remove all instances of `--set-upstream` and `-u` from the `command.script_parts`, and then reconstruct the command using the corrected script_parts. We will also correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` attribute of the `command`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find and remove all instances of --set-upstream and -u
    script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ('--set-upstream', '-u')]
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-3:]
    push_upstream = ' '.join(push_upstream)
    
    return replace_command(command, ' '.join(script_parts), f'push {push_upstream}')
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases.
