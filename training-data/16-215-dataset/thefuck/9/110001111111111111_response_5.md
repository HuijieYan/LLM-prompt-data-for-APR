The buggy function is get_new_command, which is designed to extract the push command suggested by git and modify it to remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument.

The bug is located in the if statement checking if upstream_option_index is not -1. Inside this if statement, the code attempts to pop the element at the index upstream_option_index from the command.script_parts list twice. If upstream_option_index is already -1, it results in an error because there is no element at index -1.

The failing test is related to the incorrect modification of the command.script_parts list, and the error message indicates an IndexError caused by attempting to pop an element from the list at an index that is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the pop operation is only performed if upstream_option_index is a valid index in the list. Additionally, we need to correctly replace the argument in the command.script_parts list with the modified push command suggested by git.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code handles both --set-upstream and -u options, ensuring that the pop operation is performed only if the option is found in the command.script_parts list. It also extracts the correct push command suggested by git and replaces the argument in the command.script_parts list accordingly.

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub, enabling the git push -u command to work as expected.
