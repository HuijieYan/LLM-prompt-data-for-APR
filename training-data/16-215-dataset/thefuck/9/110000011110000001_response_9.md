The buggy function attempts to remove the --set-upstream or -u option from the command, as well as its argument, and then replace it with the output of git push. The function then uses the `replace_argument` function to replace the "push" argument with the output of `git push`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the the upstream_option_index.
The bug's cause is as follows:
(a). The buggy function attempts to remove the upstream_option_index without checking whether it exists at that position or not.
(b). The failing test and error message indicate that an `IndexError` occurs during the removal of the `upstream_option_index`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the length of `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove elements.
2. Ensuring that both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are handled correctly.
3. Identifying the correct index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and removing both the option and its argument based on the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument

def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the buggy function should now correctly handle the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments. It should pass the failing test cases provided.
