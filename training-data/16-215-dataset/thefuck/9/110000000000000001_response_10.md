1. The buggy function is designed to remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command.script_parts, and then replace the "push" command with the push_upstream value obtained from the command.stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the removal of the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command.script_parts.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code attempts to remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its argument from the command.script_parts, but the logic is flawed. There is also a potential issue with the index error when trying to access the last element of the split string.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if upstream_option_index is not -1 before popping the elements from command.script_parts.
   - Handle the IndexError properly when trying to access the last element of the split string.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
