The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where the script_parts list is being modified. It seems that the pop operation is causing an IndexError when the index is out of range.

The buggy function is supposed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command in order to concatenate the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git. However, there is an issue in the pop operation when trying to remove the index.

The failing test is trying to check if the get_new_command function is correctly modifying the 'git push' command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument.

The error message indicates that there is an IndexError occurring during the pop operation.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" suggests that the command "git push -u myfork" is not being correctly modified into "git push --set-upstream myfork master" as it was before.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking if the index exists in the command.script_parts list before attempting to pop it.
- Using error handling to prevent an IndexError when trying to pop an element that does not exist.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
