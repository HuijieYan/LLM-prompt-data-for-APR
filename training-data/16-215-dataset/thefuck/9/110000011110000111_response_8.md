The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch that git suggests. However, the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `-u` option and its argument, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the `script_parts` list.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` provides different examples of commands and their expected outputs, while the error message indicates that the `IndexError` is occurring at line 32 when trying to `pop` elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" and its detailed description provide the specific scenario where the bug occurs and what the expected behavior should be.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is used to pop elements from the `script_parts` list when the `-u` option is present. Also, handling the `--set-upstream` option should fall under the same logic to avoid any issues.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the removal of the `-u` option and its argument correctly, fixing the bug and passing the failing test. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
