The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the upstream option from the command and it is not extracting the correct value for `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`.

The potential error location is the handling of the `upstream_option_index` and the extraction of `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the upstream option from the command and it is not correctly extracting the value for `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the removal of the upstream option from the command by checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` and removing them if found.
2. Extract the `push_upstream` value from the correct location in the `command.stderr`.
3. Ensure that the final command output includes the correct `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        index = script_parts.index('push')
        script_parts.pop(index + 1)
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
        index = script_parts.index('push')
        script_parts.pop(index + 1)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split()[7] + ' ' + command.stderr.split()[8] + ' ' + command.stderr.split()[9]

    new_command = ' '.join(script_parts)
    return new_command.replace('push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
