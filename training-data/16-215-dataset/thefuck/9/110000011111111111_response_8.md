The issue in the buggy function is that when popping the elements from the `command.script_parts` list, the wrong index is being used. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop an index that is out of range.

The failing test and error message indicate that the function is failing when trying to handle the `-u` flag in the `git push` command, resulting in an `IndexError: pop index out of range` error.

The expected and actual input/output variable information provided also shows that the `push_upstream` variable is not being correctly constructed in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is used when popping the elements from the `command.script_parts` list, and that the `push_upstream` variable is constructed properly.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the `-u` flag correctly and construct the `push_upstream` variable as expected. The function should also pass the failing test and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
