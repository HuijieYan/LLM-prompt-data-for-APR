The buggy function is causing an issue when trying to push a branch using the -u or --set-upstream options. The function is supposed to remove these options and their arguments from the command and then replace the 'push' keyword with the correct upstream branch. However, there is a potential error in the removal of the options and their arguments from the command.

The buggy function is closely related to the git push command and its options. The GitHub issue #538 provides an example where the function is not producing the correct output when trying to push a branch using -u or --set-upstream options.

The potential error in the function is with the removal of the upstream_option_index. The function is using the index of the first occurrence of either '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and then removing the respective option and its argument from the command. However, it is not considering the option and argument as a single entity, which may lead to removing only the option or only the argument, leaving the command in an incorrect state.

To fix the bug, we can use the pop function to remove both the option and its argument by their respective index locations. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the 'git push' command does not have an upstream branch. We can use a conditional statement to check for a valid upstream branch and then replace the 'push' keyword with the correct upstream branch.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_parts) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
        return new_command
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected function should successfully handle the -u and --set-upstream options and provide the correct command for pushing the branch. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub and ensures that the correct upstream branch is used in the git push command.
