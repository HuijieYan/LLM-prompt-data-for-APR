The problematic function is `get_new_command`. It is related to the failing test `test_get_new_command` and the error message is an `IndexError` on the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` within the `get_new_command` function.

The bug is caused by the fact that when the `upstream_option_index` is found and removed using `pop`, there is another `pop` operation for the same index immediately afterwards without checking if the index actually exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check if the index exists before performing the `pop` operation. Additionally, the logic for finding the `push_upstream` value needs to be improved to prevent errors in case certain conditions are not met.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_index = None
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_index is not None:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_index]
        if upstream_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if the index is valid
            del command.script_parts[upstream_index]  # perform pop operation if index is valid

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
