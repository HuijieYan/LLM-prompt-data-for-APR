Looking at the provided input variables and expected output, it seems that the bug in the function is related to how it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command and extracting the push upstream. The function seems to incorrectly handle the removal of these options and does not correctly parse the push upstream from the error message.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately detect and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command, and correctly extract the push upstream information from the error message.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    new_script_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in new_script_parts:
        new_script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in new_script_parts:
        new_script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-3] + ' ' + command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code for the function should now accurately handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command, and correctly extract the push upstream information from the error message. This would satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
