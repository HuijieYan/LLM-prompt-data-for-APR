1. The buggy function `get_new_command` appears to be related to the GitHub issue as it is handling the modification of the command for `git push -u origin` and ensuring that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments are removed, and then replacing the `push` argument with the upstream branch name extracted from the `stderr`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, as well as in the extraction of the upstream branch name from the `stderr`.

3. The cause of the bug could be the incorrect handling of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments in the `command.script_parts`, as well as potential issues with the extraction of the upstream branch name from the `stderr`. The GitHub issue provides specific examples of the incorrect behavior when using `git push -u`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly identifying the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments in the `command.script_parts` and then removing them.
   - Ensuring that the extraction of the upstream branch name from the `stderr` is done correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected code, the function should properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, as well as the extraction of the upstream branch name from the `stderr`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
