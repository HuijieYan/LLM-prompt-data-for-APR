The issue in the buggy function is occurring due to the incorrect implementation of removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" arguments from the command.script_parts list. This is causing an IndexError when trying to remove it again. Additionally, the replacement of the "push" command with the command from the stderr might not be the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Fix the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" arguments to ensure it does not lead to an IndexError.
2. Use the information from the stderr string to construct the new command with the desired replaced argument.
3. Ensure that the new command matches the expected value based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    script_parts[0] = push_upstream  # Replace the 'push' command
    return ' '.join(script_parts)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly construct the new command based on the input parameters and match the expected values from the failing test cases.
