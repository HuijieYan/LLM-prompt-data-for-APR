The bug is caused by an incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list after the `upstream_option_index` is found. When removing the element at the `upstream_option_index`, the next element shifts into its place, and then `pop` is called again on the same index, which leads to an `IndexError` when the script attempts to remove an element that no longer exists.

To fix the bug, the `upstream_option_index` should be adjusted after removing an element from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the element at upstream_option_index
        # Adjust the upstream_option_index if necessary
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) and command.script_parts[upstream_option_index].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `upstream_option_index` is properly adjusted after removing an element from the list, avoiding the `IndexError` that was causing the failing test.

The corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
