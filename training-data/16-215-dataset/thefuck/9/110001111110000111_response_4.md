Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `get_new_command` function where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called two times. The error message indicates an `IndexError` which suggests that the `upstream_option_index` value is out of range, leading to the error.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The `get_new_command` function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. However, there is a bug in removing these options from the `command.script_parts`.
(b). The failing test `test_get_new_command` is passing an instance of `Command` to the `get_new_command` function to check its output.
(c). The error message from the failing test indicates that the `IndexError` is occurring in the `get_new_command` function due to the out-of-range pop index.
(d). The GitHub issue provides an example of the bug with the `git push -u` command and states the expected and actual behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- The `upstream_option_index` should be checked before using it to remove items from `command.script_parts` to avoid the `IndexError`.
- The correction should also ensure that the modified command includes `--set-upstream origin master` as expected.

Corrected Code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the index is still in range
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code checks if the options `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` before attempting to get their index. It also ensures that the index is still in range before removing the items from the list. This ensures that the `IndexError` is avoided.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
