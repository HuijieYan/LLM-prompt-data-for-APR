The potential error in the buggy function is in the try-except blocks where it tries to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts. If both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the command.script_parts, the index of '-u' will override the index of '--set-upstream', leading to the removal of the wrong argument. This could result in the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we can use the 'if' conditions for checking the presence of '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately instead of using try-except blocks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
