The buggy function is part of the `git_push.py` file in the `thefuck` repository. The function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command, and then append the suggested command by git to the remaining arguments. The bug seems to occur in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, as well as in parsing the `git push` suggestion from the `stderr` output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The conditional check `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is incorrect and should be changed to `if upstream_option_index != -1`. Additionally, the method of parsing the `git push` suggestion from the `stderr` output might also be causing issues.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the git push command, but it is incorrectly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. This leads to a suggestion in the wrong format being returned. The GitHub issue provides an example of the incorrect suggestion and describes the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the conditional check for `upstream_option_index` by changing `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index != -1`.
2. Review the method for parsing the `git push` suggestion from the `stderr` output and ensure it retrieves the correct value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
