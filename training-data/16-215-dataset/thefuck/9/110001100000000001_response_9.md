Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the code block where the upstream_option_index is being checked. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` should be `if upstream_option_index != -1`. Additionally, the pop operation should be handled carefully to avoid index out of range error.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison operator `is` instead of `!=` in the condition for checking upstream_option_index. This causes the code block to not execute as expected, and the pop operation may result in an index out of range error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the comparison operator from `is` to `!=`.
2. Use exception handling to avoid index out of range errors during the pop operation.

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
