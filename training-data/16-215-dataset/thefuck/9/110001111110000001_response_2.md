1. The function `get_new_command` is designed to handle `git push` commands. It removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments from the command and fetches the upstream branch from the stderr output. The failing test function `test_get_new_command` validates the behavior of `get_new_command` by passing different variations of the `git push` command.

2. The potential error in the code lies within the conditional block where the `upstream_option_index` is checked to be `-1`. The `pop()` function is called twice on `command.script_parts` without verifying if the index is still valid after the first `pop()` operation. This can lead to an `IndexError` if the index is out of range.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `pop()` function without checking the validity of the index.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index is valid before calling the `pop()` function. This can be achieved by checking the length of `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove elements.
   
5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:  # Check if index is within bounds
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the next element after popping the index (since it's the argument)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the `command.script_parts` before calling the `pop()` function. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original code.
