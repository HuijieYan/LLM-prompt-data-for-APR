The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if it exists, and then construct a new command by replacing the `push` argument with the output provided by the `command.stderr`. However, it is not properly handling the cases where the option and its argument need to be removed.

The main issue is that it's not properly checking whether the `-u` option is present or not, and it's not handling the situation where the index to be removed might shift when the first option is removed.

To fix this, we need to properly handle the index removal and also check for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the provided input/output variable information:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected and improved function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("--set-upstream")
    if "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index("-u")

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check again after removal
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function properly removes the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their arguments, handles the index removal properly, and constructs the new command as expected in the provided test cases.
