The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command's script parts. The current code does not handle the case where '-u' is found, and it does not correctly remove the option and its argument.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the '-u' option and its argument, which leads to inaccurate suggestions for the git push command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately and remove them along with their arguments if found. We also need to correctly extract the upstream branch from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    if "--set-upstream" in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index("--set-upstream")
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove '--set-upstream'
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    elif "-u" in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index("-u")
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove '-u'
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and provide the expected output based on the given input parameters. It should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub about incorrect suggestions for the git push command.
