The bug in the provided code is that it is trying to pop elements from the list without checking if the element exists at the specified index. This is causing an IndexError in the failing test case `test_get_new_command` when trying to pop `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index exists and then remove the element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that before trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list, it checks if the index exists and whether the list has enough elements.

With this corrected implementation, it should satisfy all the provided input/output variable information as well as pass the failing test.
