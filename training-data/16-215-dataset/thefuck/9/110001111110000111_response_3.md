Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the way in which the script_parts are being manipulated, specifically the pop() method. The pop() method is causing an IndexError when trying to remove elements at the position 'upstream_option_index' from the 'command.script_parts' list.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is attempting to remove elements from the 'command.script_parts' list using the pop() method based on the indices 'upstream_option_index', which may not always exist in the list. This is leading to an IndexError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if 'upstream_option_index' exists before attempting to remove elements from 'command.script_parts'.
2. Use a safer method to remove elements from the list, such as slicing or iterating through the list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the removal of elements from 'command.script_parts' more safely, and it is expected to pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
