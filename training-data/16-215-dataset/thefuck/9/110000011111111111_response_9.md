The issue in the buggy function lies in how it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' command-line options from the 'command.script_parts' list. The function is incorrectly trying to remove the same index twice with 'command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)'.

The failing test and error message indicate that the function is encountering an IndexError when trying to pop the element at 'upstream_option_index' from the list. This is happening because the function is not correctly updating the 'upstream_option_index' after the first successful index check.

The expected input/output variable information indicates that for the failing test cases, the 'upstream_option_index' should be updated correctly to reflect the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. Additionally, the 'push_upstream' string should be constructed by replacing the 'push' argument with the correct value.

To fix the bug, the function should update the 'upstream_option_index' variable with the correct index after each successful index check for '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Additionally, the 'push_upstream' string should be updated by replacing the 'push' argument with the correct value obtained from 'command.stderr'.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Update the upstream_option_index after successful removal
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and construct the 'push_upstream' string based on the value obtained from 'command.stderr'. This should ensure that the failing test is passed and the GitHub issue is resolved.
