The bug in the provided function is that when the upstream_option_index is found, it pops the element at that index twice, which leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where the option is found, specifically when using the -u flag, which leads to popping the same index twice and causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the upstream_option_index is not -1 before attempting to pop the element at that index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if the index is found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the element at the found index
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub, as it handles the case with the -u flag correctly.
