The buggy function is trying to parse the `command.script_parts` to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, and then remove it and its argument from the script parts. However, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the function is incorrectly obtaining the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and obtain the `push_upstream` value from the appropriate location in the `command.stderr`. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there's an argument after --set-upstream or -u
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-4].strip().partition('git ')[2]  # Obtain the push_upstream value from the correct location
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the --set-upstream and -u options, and obtain the push_upstream value from `command.stderr` in a more reliable manner.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
