The buggy function "get_new_command" is supposed to manipulate the command based on the stderr output. It first checks for the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u" in the command and removes them if found. Then, it extracts the last line of the stderr, removes the leading text and returns the modified command with "push" replaced by the extracted string.

The bug occurs when trying to remove the elements from the "command.script_parts" list. The code attempts to pop the same index twice, resulting in an IndexError when the index is out of range. This error is caught in the failing test and the error message shows the exact line where the error occurs.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to find the index of the options ("-u" or "--set-upstream") and then remove them in a single step, without repeating the same index. Additionally, errors in index manipulation need to be handled properly to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
