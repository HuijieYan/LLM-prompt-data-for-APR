The buggy function is named get_new_command. The function is designed to modify a git command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command and then replacing the 'push' argument with push_upstream from the git command's stderr.

The failing test is from the test file test_git_push.py. The failing test is due to an IndexError when trying to pop an item from the script_parts list. The failing test message specifies that the pop index is out of range.

The expected input/output values are compared with the actual input/output values, and it can be observed that the upstream_option_index and push_upstream values are different from what is expected.

Based on the failing test and the actual input/output values, it can be inferred that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of the indexes of command.script_parts when trying to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its corresponding argument.

To fix the bug, the function should check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately, retrieve the correct index, and then remove both the option and its argument. Additionally, the function should handle situations where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option may not be present in the command.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument correctly and provide the expected output for the failing test cases. Additionally, this corrected function should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub repository, specifically issue #538.
