The buggy function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their respective arguments from the command, and then construct a new command using the remaining parts of the original command, concatenated with the value of `push_upstream`.

The failing test is not passing due to an `IndexError` caused by the attempt to pop the same index from `command.script_parts` twice, rather than popping the index after the first pop operation. This results in an index out of range error.

The expected value for `push_upstream` in each case is the same, while the `upstream_option_index` is expected to be -1 in Case 1 and 2 for the input `['git', 'push']`, and 2 in Cases 3, 4, and 5.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the index manipulation for `upstream_option_index` and handle the case properly where the index is -1.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the next element if it exists
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the fixed function should be able to successfully pass the failing test cases and return the expected values for the given input parameters.

This should also resolve the GitHub issue related to the suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
