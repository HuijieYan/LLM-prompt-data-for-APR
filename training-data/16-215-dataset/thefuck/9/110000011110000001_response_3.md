The potential error location within the problematic function is the attempt to remove elements from the list `command.script_parts` without first ensuring that the elements actually exist in the list.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove an element from a list at an index that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `command.stderr` may not contain the expected string "git ", which could also lead to an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code includes checks to ensure that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. It also handles the case where the expected string "git " may not be present in the `command.stderr`. This should address the `IndexError` and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
