1. The buggy function is named get_new_command and it seems to be related to the git command in some way. The failing test is testing this function by passing different git push commands and comparing the output with the expected result. The error message indicates an IndexError in the get_new_command function, specifically at the line where pop is used to remove elements from the command.script_parts list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the line where command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) is being called.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function get_new_command is not handling the case where the index for '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found properly. This is causing an IndexError when trying to remove an element from the command.script_parts list.
   (b). The failing test is showing the comparison of the function's output with the expected result, and it is failing due to the bug in the function.
   (c). The GitHub Issue is describing a specific scenario where the suggested fix is not working as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found in the command.script_parts list before trying to remove it.
   - Handle the case if the index for '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found to avoid the IndexError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should handle the case where the index for '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found and does not cause an IndexError. It should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
