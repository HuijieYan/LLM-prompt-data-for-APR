Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the try-except blocks where it is trying to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list. If the first try block finds the index, the second try block will also execute, potentially overwriting the value of upstream_option_index.


Bug's Cause:
The buggy function is trying to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command.script_parts list, but the implementation is incorrect. The try-except blocks are not handling the scenario properly, and there is a potential issue with the logic for removing the elements from the list. Additionally, the logic to extract the push_upstream value from command.stderr is not being handled properly.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a single try-except block to find both '--set-upstream' and '-u' indices and handle the removal of elements correctly.
2. Improve the logic to extract the push_upstream value from command.stderr and handle any potential errors.

Corrected Code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, the try-except blocks are restructured to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' indices properly. The removal of elements from the command.script_parts list is corrected, and the logic to extract push_upstream from command.stderr is unchanged.
