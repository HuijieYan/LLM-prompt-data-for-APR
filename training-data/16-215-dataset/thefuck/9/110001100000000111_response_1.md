The potential error in the buggy function lies in the handling of the upstream_option_index and the removal of the --set-upstream or -u and its argument. 

The buggy function is part of a larger application called "thefuck" which is designed to correct the previous console command with the right command. The function is specifically related to the git_push command. 

The GitHub issue #558 suggests that the git push -u origin command is broken and needs to be fixed. The detailed description provides an example of the issue and suggests that the current suggestion is incorrect and should be reverted to its previous state.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u and its argument, and provide the correct suggestion using the push_upstream variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Need to pop again to remove the argument
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Need to pop again to remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u and its argument and provide the correct suggestion for git push -u origin. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
