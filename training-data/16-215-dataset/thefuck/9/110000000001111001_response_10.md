Looking at the buggy function, it seems like the main issue is with how the upstream option is being removed from the command.script_parts list. The function is incorrectly removing both the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and is also missing the necessary index checks. Additionally, the function doesn't handle the case where the '--set-upstream' option has an argument.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately, and also account for the case where '--set-upstream' has an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should handle the various cases provided and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
