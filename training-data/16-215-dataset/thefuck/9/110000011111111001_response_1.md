The buggy function is trying to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command, and then creating a new command with the push command and its argument retrieved from the stderr. However, there are a couple of issues with the code.

The bug is likely caused by the lines:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The second `pop` is causing an `IndexError` because `upstream_option_index` has already been removed by the first `pop`. 

To fix the bug, the script needs to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and also account for the case where the options have an argument. Additionally, the `pop` operation should only be performed if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to check if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before performing the `pop` operation. Also, an additional check can be added for the arguments that come after the options.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        arg_index = upstream_option_index + 1
        if arg_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(arg_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
