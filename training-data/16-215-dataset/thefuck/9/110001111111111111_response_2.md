The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. The error is likely occurring because it tries to pop the same index twice if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is the way the function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. When both options are present, it tries to pop the same index twice, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we can avoid using `pop()` and instead create a new list with the required values. We also need to handle the case when neither `--set-upstream` nor `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    updated_script_parts = []
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            # Neither option found, return the original command
            return command.script.strip()
    else:
        # Found either option, create a new list with the option and its argument removed
        updated_script_parts = command.script_parts[:upstream_option_index] + command.script_parts[upstream_option_index+2:]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
