The problem with the buggy function is that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, it attempts to remove it again, leading to an `IndexError` if the option was not found in the first place. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `--quiet` is passed as an argument to `git push`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it.
2. Handle the case where `--quiet` is passed as an argument to `git push`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# import the required modules before fixing the buggy function
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if '--quiet' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--quiet')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output variable values should be satisfied.

The corrected function modified the logic to handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options by first checking if they exist in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. Additionally, it now handles the case where `--quiet` is passed as an argument to `git push`.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for the failing tests.
