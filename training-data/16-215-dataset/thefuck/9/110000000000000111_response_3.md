1. The buggy function is meant to modify the git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. It then extracts the git push suggestion from the stderr and replaces the argument in the original command with it. The GitHub issue is related to the incorrect suggestion for the git push -u command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. 

3. The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the function does not correctly handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, which leads to the incorrect git push suggestion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using a more robust method to identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument.
   - Ensuring that the correct suggestion is extracted from the stderr and replacing the argument in the original command.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    updated_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument has been improved to use list comprehension. This ensures that only the correct parts are removed from the command. The extraction of the git push suggestion from the stderr and its replacement in the original command has been retained. This corrected function should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
