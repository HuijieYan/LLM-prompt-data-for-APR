1. The buggy function 'info' is a method within the Fish class. The purpose of this function is to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. The GitHub issue mentions that the thefuck plugin uses the '-v' option, which triggers a recursive loop because of the info() function in shells/fish.py.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function without closing the process, leading to a potential resource leak.

3. Bug Cause Analysis:
   (a). The buggy function uses the Popen function to execute a subprocess to get the Fish shell version.
   (b). The Fish class is not handling the subprocess properly, which may lead to resource leaks and the mentioned recursive loop.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that using the '-v' option triggers a recursive loop, indicating that the problematic function is the source of the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Close the process after using Popen to prevent resource leaks.
   (b). Implement error handling to prevent potential recursive loops or other unintended behaviors when using the '-v' option.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        with Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL) as proc:
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
