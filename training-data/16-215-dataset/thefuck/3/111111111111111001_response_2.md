The issue with the `info` function is that it is not using the correct command to get the fish shell version. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` but it should be using `fish --version` to get the correct version information.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
