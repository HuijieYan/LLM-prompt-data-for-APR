The issue with the `info` function is that it is not using the correct command to retrieve the fish shell version. The correct command is `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info():
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This should fix the issue and the test should pass without any errors.
