The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line that fetches the version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the version returned by the function contains extra text ("fish, version") that needs to be removed.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command used to fetch the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to fetch the Fish shell version and remove the extra text.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # only get the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This updated code uses `['fish', '--version']` command to fetch the Fish shell version and then extracts only the version number from the output, which should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
