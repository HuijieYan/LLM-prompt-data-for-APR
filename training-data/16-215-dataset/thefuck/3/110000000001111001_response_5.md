The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not actually executing the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the shell. Instead, it is simply returning the value 'Fish Shell' followed by the version obtained from an unknown source. This is evident from the expected and actual output variable values, where the expected version is 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual version is just '3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, we need to use the subprocess module to actually execute the command and capture the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function will execute the command to get the version of the shell and return it in the correct format 'fish, version x.x.x'. This will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
