1. The buggy function "info" is part of the "Fish" class which is a subclass of the "Generic" class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen object without waiting for the process to complete and obtain the output.

3. (a) The buggy function "info" is using the Popen object to execute the command to get the Fish shell version.
   (b) The "Fish" class is not directly related to the bug, but it contains the problematic function "info".
   (c) The Popen object is related to the bug as it is used to execute the command and retrieve the shell version.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Add a call to the "communicate()" method of the Popen object to wait for the process to complete and obtain the output.
   b. Use subprocess.check_output() instead of Popen to simplify the code and ensure the output is properly retrieved.
   c. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import check_output, CalledProcessError

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except CalledProcessError:
            return 'Error: Unable to retrieve Fish shell version'
```
In the corrected code, the subprocess module's `check_output` function is used to execute the command and retrieve the output. Any exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution are also handled.
