Potential error location: The issue is with the command being used to obtain the Fish shell version. The command used in the `info` function is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test code is expecting the output of 'fish --version'.

Bug's cause: The buggy function is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version. This is evident from the failing test where the expected version is '3.5.9' but the actual output is 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command in the `info` function to execute 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
2. Use the correct command to obtain the Fish shell version in the `info` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```
