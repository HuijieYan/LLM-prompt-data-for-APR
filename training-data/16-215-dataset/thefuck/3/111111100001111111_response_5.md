Potential error location within the problematic function: The issue is occurring when the function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the Popen command.

Bug's cause:
(a). The info() function in the Fish class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the Popen command, but it is not capturing the correct output format.
(b). The returned version is not matching the expected format, leading to a failing test case indicated by the GitHub issue.
(c). The GitHub issue highlights that the thefuck -v command is triggering a recursive loop, indicating that the issue is related to the version retrieval process.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Update the way the version information is processed and returned.
3. Ensure that the function does not result in a recursive loop when called with the -v flag.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
