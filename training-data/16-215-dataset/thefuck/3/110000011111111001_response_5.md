The problematic function is the `info` function. The bug is caused by the command used to get the shell version in the `info` function. The command should have been 'fish --version' instead of 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION''.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the command in the `Popen` call to 'fish --version'.
2. Decode the output of the `Popen` call with the correct format 'utf-8' and remove the leading 'fish, version' text to get the version number.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[13:]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test provided.
