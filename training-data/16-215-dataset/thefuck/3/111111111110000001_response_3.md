The potential error in the `info` function is that it is trying to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen` with `stdout=PIPE`, but in the test function, it is expecting the command `fish --version` to be executed. This inconsistency is leading to the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed in the `info` function to match what is expected in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With the above change, the `info` function will now execute the command `fish --version` and return the correct version of the Fish shell, which will satisfy the failing test.
