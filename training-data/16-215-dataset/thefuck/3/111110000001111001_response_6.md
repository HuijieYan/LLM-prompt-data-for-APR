The issue with the buggy function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes. It looks like the function is trying to use the `Popen` class and some other classes without importing them first.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and classes within the Fish class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

This code includes the necessary import statements for the `Popen` class and uses the correct syntax to call the `Popen` class and its methods. With these changes, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
