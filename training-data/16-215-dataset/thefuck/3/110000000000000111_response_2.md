1. The buggy function 'info' is part of the FishShell class and it is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that when the thefuck -v command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop due to the shell's fish.py:Fish.info() function. This suggests that the function 'info' is causing the thefuck -v command to hang during shell initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is being used.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute the command ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']. 

3. By looking at the provided buggy function and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug's cause is the recursive loop that is triggered when the thefuck -v command is executed. This loop is caused by the faulty behavior of the 'info' function when attempting to retrieve the shell's version using the Popen command. This behavior is what causes the thefuck -v command to hang during shell initialization.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement a check in the 'info' function to prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the thefuck -v command is executed.
   - Replace the Popen command with an alternative method to retrieve the shell's version that does not cause the thefuck -v command to hang.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code eliminates the use of Popen and directly retrieves the shell's version using the os.getenv method. This should prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the thefuck -v command is executed, resolving the hanging issue during shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
