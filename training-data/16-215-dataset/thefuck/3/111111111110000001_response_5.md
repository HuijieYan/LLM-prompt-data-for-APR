The potential error location within the `info` method is the command used to obtain the Fish version. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This is validated by the failing test's error message which shows that the actual output obtained from the command is 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, the command used to obtain the Fish version should be changed to 'fish --version' and the Popen call should be modified to reflect this change.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    # Corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version.split(",")[1].strip()}'
```

With this change, the `info` method will now correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This corrected code should now pass the failing test.
