The issue is with the command being executed to get the version of the fish shell. The command being used in the `info` function is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to retrieve the version. Additionally, the assertion in the test function needs to be updated to match the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the updated code, the `info` function will execute the correct command to retrieve the fish shell version. This should make the function pass the failing test.
