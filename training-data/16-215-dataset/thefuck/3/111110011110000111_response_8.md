1. The buggy function `info` is a method of the class `Fish`. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test for this function is checking if the returned value matches the expected value. The GitHub issue suggests that there is a problem with the function causing a recursive loop when used with the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish.

2. The potential error location is most likely the command being used to get the version of the shell (`['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`).

3. 
   (a). The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class uses the `Popen` class to execute a command that retrieves the version of the Fish shell. It then returns the version with a specific format.
   (b). The failing test checks if the returned version matches the expected version.
   (c). The error message indicates that the returned version has additional text (`fish, version`) which is not expected, causing the assertion error.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the problem with the function causes a recursive loop when used with the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
   - Modify the parsing of the returned version to remove any additional text.
   - Address the recursive loop issue when used with the TheFuck plugin.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from typing import Generic
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to retrieve version
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Modified parsing of returned version
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function uses `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and then modifies the parsing of the returned version to remove the additional text. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. It also addresses the problem with the recursive loop when used with the TheFuck plugin.
