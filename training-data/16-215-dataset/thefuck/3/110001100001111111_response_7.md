The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current implementation uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' as the command, but the expected version is 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the command used to retrieve the version is incorrect.

The related function 'Popen' seems to be used to execute a command in the shell, and it is being used to capture the version of the Fish shell. However, there is a discrepancy in the expected and actual input/output variable values, which indicates that the command being executed is incorrect.

The GitHub issue indicates that the thefuck -v command triggers a recursive loop due to a problem in the Fish.info() function. This aligns with the analysis of the function and its related functions, as well as the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the command used to capture the version of the Fish shell needs to be updated to 'fish --version' to align with the expected version format. Additionally, the command needs to include the shell=True parameter to properly execute the command.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function should align with the expected input/output variable information provided and should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
