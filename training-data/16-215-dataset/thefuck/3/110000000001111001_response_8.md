The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `Popen` function without importing it from the `subprocess` module.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` function is not being imported from the `subprocess` module, causing the function to fail when trying to call it.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` function needs to be imported from the `subprocess` module. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
