1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The failing test is checking if the `info` function returns the expected version of the shell, and it's also checking the arguments passed to `Popen`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to `Popen`, as well as how the output is being processed.

3. The bug is caused by the `info` function not properly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish --version` command. The failing test expects the version number to be '3.5.9' but instead, it gets 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

4. Approach for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command passed to `Popen` to be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
   - Process the output to extract only the version number, without any other surrounding text.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
