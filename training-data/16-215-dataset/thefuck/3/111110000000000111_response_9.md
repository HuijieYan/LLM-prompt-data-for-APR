1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the class "Fish". It is trying to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a subprocess using Popen. The GitHub issue indicates that when the TheFuck plugin uses "thefuck -v", it triggers a recursive loop because of this function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the Popen subprocess call, which might be causing the recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is that the "info" method of the "Fish" class is incorrectly obtaining the shell version, triggering a recursive loop when used with the TheFuck plugin.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Changing the method of obtaining the shell name and version to avoid triggering a recursive loop.
   - Adding a condition to check if the function is being called from within the TheFuck plugin to avoid the recursive loop.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'thefuck' in self.__class__.__name__.lower():
            return "TheFuck plugin"
        else:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
