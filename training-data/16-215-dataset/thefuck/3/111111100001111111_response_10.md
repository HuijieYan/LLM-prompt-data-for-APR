Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` in the `info` function. The expected value for the version includes the text "fish, version", which is not present in the current implementation.

Bug's cause:
- The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.
- The function is using the `Popen` class to execute a command to retrieve the version of the fish shell, but it is not formatting the version string correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the format string in the `return` statement of the `info` function to include the text "fish, version" before the version number.
2. Ensure that the command being executed using `Popen` returns the expected output.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code includes the modification to the format string in the `return` statement to include "fish, version" before the version number. This change ensures that the function returns the expected value for the version of the fish shell.
