1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function is using subprocess.Popen to execute a command in the shell and capture its output.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of Popen without importing it from the subprocess module.

3. The cause of the bug is the missing import statement for Popen. The function is also missing the import statements for Generic, Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to import the necessary modules and classes, and use the correct syntax to execute the shell command and capture its output.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected code, we have imported Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL, and Generic. We have also added the `shell=True` argument in the Popen call, and used `communicate()[0]` to capture the output of the shell command.
