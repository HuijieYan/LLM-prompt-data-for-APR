The issue seems to be related to the incorrect command being used to get the Fish shell version, and also with the discrepancy in the expected and actual values for the version variable.

The failing test is checking for the output of 'fish --version' command and expects the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9'. However, the actual output is '3.5.9', and the function appends 'Fish Shell' to the version, resulting in the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to get the Fish shell version, and the string formatting should be modified to match the expected output string.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to change the command used to get the Fish shell version and modify the string formatting in the return statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output values. The GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the faulty function should also be resolved.
