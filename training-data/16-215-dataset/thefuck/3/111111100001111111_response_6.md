Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to arise from the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Bug Cause: 
The function tries to retrieve the Fish shell version using the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, but this command does not return the expected value.

Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Validate the command being used and check if it's returning the expected value.
3. Make sure that the plugin is not triggering a recursive loop due to the way the command is being executed.

Corrected Code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' with 'fish --version', the function should be able to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
