Analysis:
1. The function is trying to get the version of the current shell by running a command in the shell and capturing its output.
2. The potential error location is with the usage of Popen to run the 'fish -c' command and capturing its output.
3. The bug is caused by not properly handling the subprocess and capturing its output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the subprocess module to run the command and capture its output in a more robust way.
2. Properly handle the subprocess to avoid potential issues with reading the output.

Corrected code:
```python
import subprocess

# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
