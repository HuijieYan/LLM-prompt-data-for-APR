1. The buggy function 'info' is trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and then formatting the output as 'Fish Shell <version>'. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin using the 'thefuck -v' command, which triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the 'thefuck -v' command, which leads to a recursive loop due to the implementation of the 'info' function in the fish.py file.

3. The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the 'thefuck -v' command, which calls the 'Fish.info()' function repeatedly. The function 'info' itself uses the Popen function to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', which may also contribute to the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: 
  - Implementing a check in the 'info' function to prevent recursive calls when triggered by 'thefuck -v'
  - Modifying the 'thefuck' plugin to handle the 'fish.py' file differently when initializing the shell

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The fixed 'info' function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'THEFUCK' in os.environ:
        return 'Fish Shell'
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the environment variable 'THEFUCK' is present, indicating that it's a call from the 'thefuck' plugin. If it is present, the function simply returns 'Fish Shell' without making further calls to prevent the recursive loop. This modification addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
