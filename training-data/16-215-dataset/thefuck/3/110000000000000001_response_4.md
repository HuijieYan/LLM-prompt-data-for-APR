1. The function seems to be trying to retrieve the version of the current shell and return it as a string.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen without importing it from the subprocess module.

3. The bug's cause is that the Popen class is being used without importing it from the subprocess module, which causes a NameError since Popen is not defined.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the Popen class from the subprocess module.
   - Add error handling for the case when the 'fish' command is not available or the $FISH_VERSION environment variable is not set.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Fish shell not found"
    except Exception as e:
        return "An error occurred: " + str(e)
```
In the corrected code, we import the subprocess module and use the subprocess.Popen class with proper error handling to retrieve the version of the current shell. If the 'fish' command is not found or there's an error during the process, appropriate error messages are returned.
