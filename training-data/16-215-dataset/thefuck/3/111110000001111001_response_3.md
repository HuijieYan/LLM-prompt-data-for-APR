The problem with the buggy function is that it is not importing the necessary modules, and it is also not defining the Generic class that it is supposed to inherit from.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and define the Generic class. We also need to modify the command used in the Popen call to include 'fish -v' to get the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables provided in the test case.
