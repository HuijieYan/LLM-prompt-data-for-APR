The problem with the current implementation is that the command being passed to Popen is incorrect. The correct command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. Additionally, the expected version format needs to be modified to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected value and pass the failing test.
