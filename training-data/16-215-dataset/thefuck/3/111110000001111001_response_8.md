First, the code is missing the necessary imports for `Generic`, `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL`. Additionally, `Mock` objects are being used as variable inputs, which could be causing issues with returning expected values.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated as follows:

```python
from typing import Generic
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the necessary imports and adjusting the return statement to include 'version' in the correct format, the code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
