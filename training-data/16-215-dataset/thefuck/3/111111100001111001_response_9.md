Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command being passed to Popen. The current command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` only echos the value of the FISH_VERSION environment variable, but it does not add the string "fish, version" before the version number, as expected in the output.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is not properly formatting the output to include the string "Fish Shell" before the version number.
(b). The related function Popen is not being passed the correct command to obtain the desired output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command passed to Popen to include the desired output format.
2. Update the format string for the returned value to include "Fish Shell" before the version number.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):  
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Modified command to obtain the shell version
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)  # Updated format string for the returned value
```

This corrected code modifies the command passed to Popen to simply retrieve the shell version using `['fish', '-v']`, and updates the format string for the returned value to include "Fish Shell" before the version number, as expected in the failing test case.
