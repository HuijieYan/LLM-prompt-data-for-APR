Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command is incorrect and is not returning the expected version format.

Bug's cause:
(a). Buggy function: The `info` function is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. It is using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `fish --version`.
(b). Buggy class: The `Fish` class does not have the correct implementation to retrieve the Fish shell version.
(c). Failing test and error message: The failing test is expecting the version to be `'fish, version 3.5.9'` but the actual result is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
(d). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value: The actual command used to retrieve the version is not returning the expected format.
(e). GitHub Issue information: The issue is related to the incorrect implementation of the version retrieval in Fish shell.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function to `fish --version`.
2. Update the implementation in the `Fish` class to correctly retrieve and format the version.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected format.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code now uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and formats it as expected by the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
