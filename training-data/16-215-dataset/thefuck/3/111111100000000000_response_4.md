The fixed version of the function is as follows:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
