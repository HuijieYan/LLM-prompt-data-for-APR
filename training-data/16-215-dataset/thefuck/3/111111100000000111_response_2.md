1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class in the fish.py file within the thefuck project. The function "info" is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggers a recursive loop, which is likely caused by the "info" function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command "thefuck -v" triggering a recursive loop due to the way the "info" function is implemented. 

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the "info" function uses the Popen command to execute the "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" command, which retrieves the version of the Fish shell. This action is likely leading to a recursive loop when "thefuck -v" is invoked, causing the shell to hang. This issue is confirmed by the GitHub issue, which states that the thefuck plugin uses "thefuck -v" to regenerate functions, leading to the recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include updating the "info" function to handle the "thefuck -v" command differently, or finding an alternative way for the thefuck plugin to detect when to regenerate functions without causing a recursive loop. Additionally, the usage of Popen and subprocess in the "info" function could be reviewed to ensure it does not lead to unintended behavior.

5. The corrected code for the "info" function in the fish.py file is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'TF_ALIAS' not in os.environ:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return ""
```

This corrected code checks if the "TF_ALIAS" environment variable is present, and if it is not, it fetches the version of the Fish shell using the Popen command. If the "TF_ALIAS" environment variable is present, it returns an empty string. This change prevents the recursive loop from occurring when the thefuck plugin is used with the Fish shell.
