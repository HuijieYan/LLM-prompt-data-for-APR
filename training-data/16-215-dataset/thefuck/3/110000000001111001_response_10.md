The bug in the function is due to the incorrect command being passed to Popen. The 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command is not required. Instead, we should directly run the 'fish' command with the '--version' option to retrieve the shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to Popen. We also need to handle the version string to match the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split('\n')[0].split()[2]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
