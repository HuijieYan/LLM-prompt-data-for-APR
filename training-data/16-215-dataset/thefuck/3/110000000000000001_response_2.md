1. The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it as a string. However, it appears that the function may not be properly retrieving the version, and there are potential issues with the use of Popen and the way the version is being retrieved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way Popen is being used to execute the command and retrieve the version.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command and returning it as the version.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using subprocess.check_output to capture the output of the command directly
   - Checking for any errors or exceptions that may be occurring during the process
   - Ensuring that the command is properly executed and that the output is being captured correctly

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # handle any potential errors here
        return 'Error retrieving shell version'
```
