1. The buggy function "info" is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the Popen function to execute a command to get the Fish shell version. The test function "test_info" checks if the output of the info function matches the expected version and if the Popen call_args matches the expected command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command executed using Popen and the way it retrieves the version information.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the command being executed using Popen is not retrieving the version information in the expected format. The failing test and the error message show that the actual output includes extra information ("fish, version") compared to the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command executed using Popen to retrieve only the version number without any extra information.
   - Update the decoding and formatting of the version information to match the expected format.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL   # import necessary modules

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # modify the command to retrieve only the version number
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[2]  # extract only the version number from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # format the version information

```

After correcting the function, the test function "test_info" should pass without any errors.
