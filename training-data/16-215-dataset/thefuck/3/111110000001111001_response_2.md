The issue with the `info` function is that it is not actually running the command and reading its output. Instead, it's reading from a MagicMock object, which is not the real output of the shell command. This is likely due to the function being unit tested and the `Popen` object being replaced with a MagicMock.

To fix this, we should use a more robust way of capturing the output of the shell command, such as using the `subprocess.check_output` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], shell=True, text=True).strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function now uses `subprocess.check_output` to execute the shell command and capture its output, ensuring that it will work as expected.
