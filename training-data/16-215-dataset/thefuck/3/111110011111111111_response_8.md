The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the way it retrieves the version information of the Fish shell. The function is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the failing test is expecting the command to be 'fish --version'.

The failing test is checking for the exact string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy in the expected and actual output is causing the test to fail.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to how the version information is being retrieved, which triggers a recursive loop. This indicates that the issue might be related to how the Fish shell version is being fetched.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to run the 'fish --version' command instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this change, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and return it in the expected format. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
