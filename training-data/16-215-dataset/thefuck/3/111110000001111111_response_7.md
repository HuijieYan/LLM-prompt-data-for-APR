The problematic function, `info`, is part of the `Fish` class and is responsible for retrieving the version of the Fish shell. The function uses the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and retrieve the version number.

The expected input/output variable information indicates that the function should return the version number of the Fish shell with the prefix "Fish Shell". However, the actual return value does not include the prefix "Fish Shell" and instead only returns the version number.

The GitHub issue suggests that the function `info` triggers a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, which indicates that the function may be causing unexpected behavior or hanging due to the way it retrieves the shell version.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to ensure that it retrieves and returns the version of the Fish shell in the expected format. Additionally, any potential recursive loop or hanging behavior should be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                        stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Unable to retrieve Fish shell version: {str(e)}'
```

With this correction, the `info` function now properly returns the version of the Fish shell with the prefix "Fish Shell," and also includes error handling in case the version cannot be retrieved. This should address the issue reported on the GitHub and ensure that the function returns the expected value and type of variables.
