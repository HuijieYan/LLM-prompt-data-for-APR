The problem lies in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. The `-c` flag is missing which leads to the command not executing properly. 

The failing test is expecting the output of `shell.info()` to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but it is actually returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The bug is caused by the missing `-c` flag in the Popen command, which causes the command not to execute properly, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `-c` flag to the command in the `Popen` call in the `info` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code includes the `-c` flag in the `Popen` call, ensuring that the command is executed properly and returns the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This fix will resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
