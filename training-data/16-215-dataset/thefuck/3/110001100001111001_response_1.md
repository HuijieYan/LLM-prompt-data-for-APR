The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the output of the Popen command and extracting the version number from it. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the output of the Popen command is handled and extract the version number correctly.

One approach for fixing the bug is to use the communicate method of the Popen object to retrieve the output and error streams and then extract the version number from the output.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly extract the version number from the output of the Popen command and return the expected version string.
