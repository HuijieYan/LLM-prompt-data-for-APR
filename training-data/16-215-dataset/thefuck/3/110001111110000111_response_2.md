1. The buggy function "info" is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses Popen to execute a command and retrieve the version, and then formats it to return the shell name and version. The failing test function "test_info" checks if the info function returns the correct shell name and version, and also checks the command executed using Popen. The error message indicates that the actual output of the function does not match the expected output. Additionally, the GitHub issue suggests that the function causes a recursive loop in some scenarios.

2. The potential error location within the "info" function is the command executed using Popen to retrieve the shell version.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to how the command is executed and the formatting of the output:
   (a). The "info" function uses Popen to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version.
   (b). The failing test function expects the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but receives 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
   (c). The error message explicitly states the mismatch between the expected and actual output.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the function causes a recursive loop in some cases, which could be related to how the shell version is retrieved and formatted.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adjusting the command executed using Popen to retrieve the shell version.
   - Modifying the formatting of the shell version to ensure it matches the expected output.
   - Addressing the potential recursive loop by reviewing the usage of the function in different scenarios.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function should now properly retrieve and format the shell version. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to the recursive loop.
