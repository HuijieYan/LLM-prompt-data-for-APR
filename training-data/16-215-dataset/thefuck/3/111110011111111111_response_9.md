Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The Popen command is trying to execute 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', but the expected version string is 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy is leading to the failing test.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to get the Fish shell version. The Popen command is not returning the expected version string, leading to the failing test.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the Popen command to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.
2. Modify the 'info' function to handle the output of the Popen command correctly.

Corrected Code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[10:]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the code uses 'fish --version' to get the version information and then strips the 'fish, version ' string from the output. This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
