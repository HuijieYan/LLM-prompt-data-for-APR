The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to fetch the version of the fish shell. It is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. This causes the version string to be different than expected, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to fetch the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function will return the correct version string and pass the failing test.
