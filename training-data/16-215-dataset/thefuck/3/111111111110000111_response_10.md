1. The buggy function is `info` in the `Fish` class which is part of the `fish.py` file. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test `test_info` is located in the `test_fish.py` file and it checks if the `info` function returns the correct version of the shell. The error message indicates that the returned string from the `info` function is not formatted correctly. The GitHub issue states that the problem lies within the `info` function and it is causing a recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the `Popen` command which tries to get the version of the shell by running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This command is not returning the expected version format.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` command is not returning the correct version format, causing the string formatting in the `info` function to be incorrect. This results in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the `Popen` command to retrieve the correct version format.
   - Changing the string formatting in the `info` function to match the expected version format.
   - Refactoring the `info` function to use a different method to get the shell version.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the  buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2].strip())
```

With the corrected code, the `info` function retrieves the shell version using `fish --version` and formats it correctly. This should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
