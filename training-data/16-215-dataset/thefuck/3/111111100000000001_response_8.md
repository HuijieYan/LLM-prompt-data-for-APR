Potential error: The function 'info' is calling Popen to execute the 'fish -c' command and retrieve the version, but it is not handling the process properly, which could lead to issues with resource management and data retrieval.

Bug cause:
(a) The 'info' function is not handling the Popen process properly.
(b) The 'Fish' class is not handling the Popen process properly.
(c) The related function Popen is not being properly managed for data retrieval.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the subprocess module to properly handle the Popen process and data retrieval.
2. Ensure proper error handling and resource management for the subprocess.
3. Implement encoding and decoding properly for the data retrieval.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

import subprocess

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```
By using the subprocess module, handling the Popen process properly, and managing the data retrieval using 'communicate', the bug has been fixed in the corrected code.
