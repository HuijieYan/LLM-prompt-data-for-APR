1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not doing so correctly. It uses the Popen class from the subprocess module to run the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command and capture the output, but there are errors in how it handles the subprocess and the output.

2. The potential error location within the function is in how it handles the subprocess output. The proc.stdout.read() method is used to read the output from the subprocess, but it may not capture the entire output, resulting in an incomplete version number being returned.

3. The cause of the bug is that the subprocess output is not being handled correctly, and the function may not be capturing the entire output of the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include using the communicate() method of the Popen class to ensure that all output is captured, handling any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution, and properly formatting the version number before returning it.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return 'Error getting shell information: {}'.format(e)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'An error occurred: {}'.format(e)
```

In the corrected code, we use the subprocess.Popen class to run the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command and capture the output. We then use the communicate() method to ensure that all output is captured. Any exceptions that occur during the subprocess execution are also properly handled.
