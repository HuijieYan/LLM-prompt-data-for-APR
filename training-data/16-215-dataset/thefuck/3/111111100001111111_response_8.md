The problem in the `info` function is that it is using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command to get the Fish Shell version, but it is not adding the "fish, version" prefix to the version number as expected. This is causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line where the version is retrieved from the command output and add the "fish, version" prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)  # Adding the "fish, version" prefix to the version number
```

With this change, the function should now return the correct version number, which will fix the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
