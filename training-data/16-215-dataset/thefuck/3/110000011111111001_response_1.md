The issue with the original function is that it is using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to retrieve the version of the fish shell, but the test is expecting the command "fish --version". Additionally, the function is not using the Popen.communicate() method to return the output of the command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command and return the output of the command using Popen.communicate().

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function will use the correct command to retrieve the version of the fish shell and return the expected output. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
