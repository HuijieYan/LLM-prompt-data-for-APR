1. The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` class to execute a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, it is not specifying `shell=True`, which may be causing issues in executing the command.

2. The potential error location is the usage of the `Popen` function without specifying `shell=True`, which may lead to the command not being executed properly.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the fact that the `Popen` function is not being executed properly, leading to the wrong version of the Fish shell being fetched. This can lead to a recursive loop and cause the initialization to hang, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Modify the `Popen` function to include `shell=True` to ensure the command is executed properly.
   b. Use the `subprocess.run` function instead of `Popen` for simplicity and better handling of input/output.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                             stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, 
                             shell=True,
                             text=True).stdout.strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
