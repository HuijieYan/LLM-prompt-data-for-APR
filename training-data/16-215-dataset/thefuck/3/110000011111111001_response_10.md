The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the fish shell version. The correct command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

To fix the bug, update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version', and then strip the unnecessary parts from the version string returned by the command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

This updated code will execute the correct command to get the version of the fish shell and then return the result in the expected format. This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
