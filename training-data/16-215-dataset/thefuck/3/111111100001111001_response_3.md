Potential Error:
The Popen function is not imported from the subprocess module, which is why the function is failing.

Bug's Cause:
The function is trying to use the Popen function without importing it from the subprocess module. This causes the function to fail as it cannot recognize Popen.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by importing the Popen function from the subprocess module at the beginning of the file.

Corrected Code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
By importing the Popen function from the subprocess module, the bug in the code will be fixed, and the function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
