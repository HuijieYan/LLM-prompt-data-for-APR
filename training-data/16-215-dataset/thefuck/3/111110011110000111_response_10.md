1. The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell. The failing test `test_info` is testing this method. The error message indicates that the expected output of the `info` function is not matching the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that thebug is related to a recursive loop triggered by the `info` method in the `Fish` class in the `shells/fish.py` file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to obtain the Fish shell version.

3. Bug cause:
   (a). The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to obtain the Fish shell version using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. 
   (b). The failing test is setting up the mock for the `Popen` class in such a way that it returns `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `stdout.read` is called.
   (c). The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the bug is related to a recursive loop triggered by the `info` method, possibly due to the way the shell version is obtained.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command used to obtain the Fish shell version to ensure it returns just the version number without any extra text.
   - Ensure that the `info` method in the `Fish` class does not trigger a recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
This corrected code uses `fish --version` to obtain the version and then extracts the version number from the output. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
