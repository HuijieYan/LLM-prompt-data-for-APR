The issue with the buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is that it is using the incorrect command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The failing test expects the shell version to be retrieved using the command `'fish --version'`, but the function is not using this command.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the retrieved version string is not matching the expected value.

The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug is causing a hang in the initialization of Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the shell version. It should use `'fish --version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now use the correct command to retrieve the shell version, which will make it pass the failing test. The corrected code also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the hang during the initialization of Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
