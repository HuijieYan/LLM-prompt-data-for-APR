# The corrected version of the function
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
The issues fixed in the corrected version of the function are:
1. Import statements for `Popen`, `PIPE`, `DEVNULL`, and `Generic` have been added.
2. The `shell=True` parameter has been added to the `Popen` function for shell command execution.
3. The indentation and code formatting have been corrected.
