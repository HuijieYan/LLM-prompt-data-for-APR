Potential Error Location: The potential error in the buggy function is that the command being passed to Popen to get the FISH_VERSION is not capturing the correct output.

Bug Cause:
(a). The buggy function is trying to get the version of the fish shell by running the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and capturing the output. However, it is not capturing the correct output.
(b). The related Popen function is not handling the command correctly.
(c). The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value is that the version string retrieved is missing the correct version information.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command being passed to Popen to capture the correct output.
2. Ensure that the stdout is captured and decoded properly to get the version information.

Corrected Code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code modifies the command passed to Popen to get the version of the fish shell using the '--version' option. It also ensures that the stdout is read and decoded properly to capture the version information. This should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
