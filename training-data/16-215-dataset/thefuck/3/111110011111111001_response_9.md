The issue with the `info` function is that it is not running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` as intended. Instead, it is running the command `fish --version`, which is why the test is failing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being passed to `Popen` to `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, we need to update the expected `version` value to match the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
