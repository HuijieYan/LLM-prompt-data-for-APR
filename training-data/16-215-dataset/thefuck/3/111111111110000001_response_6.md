The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. It seems that the command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect, which leads to the incorrect output in the test.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the Fish shell version is not correct, which leads to the incorrect version being returned by the `info` function.

To fix the bug, the correct command to get the Fish shell version should be used. The correct command is `['fish', '--version']`. This command will return the version of the Fish shell, which can then be parsed to get the version number.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Split the output and get the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command to get the Fish shell version, the function will now return the correct version and pass the failing test.
