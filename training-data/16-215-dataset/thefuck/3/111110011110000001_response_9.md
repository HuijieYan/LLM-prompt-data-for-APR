1. The `Fish` class contains the `info` function, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. The failing test is asserting that `shell.info()` should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it's currently returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The failing test seems to be mocking the `Popen` function to return the incorrect output, leading to the failure of the assertion.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the handling of the command execution and capturing the version output.

3. (a). The buggy function: The `info` function is executing a command using `Popen` and capturing the version information from the shell to form the return string.

   (b). The buggy class: The `Fish` class contains the `info` function, and it might be incorrectly handling the shell version information.

   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test is mocking the `Popen` function to return an incorrect version information, causing the assertion to fail.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the command executed by Popen and ensure it captures the correct version information.
   - Update the parsing of version information to extract the correct version.
   - Verify that the `Popen` function is mocked correctly in the test.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the command executed by `Popen` is updated to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure it captures the correct version information. The parsing of the version information is also updated to extract the correct version. This code should pass the failing test.
