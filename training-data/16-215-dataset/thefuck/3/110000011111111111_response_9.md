1. The buggy function is `info`, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the fish shell and retrieve the version. However, the test function is failing with an assertion error because the actual output of the `info` function includes the string "fish, version" before the version number, which is not expected. The GitHub issue suggests that this bug is causing a recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish with TheFuck plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the version is retrieved from the output of the subprocess. It seems that the command being executed is not returning the expected format.

3. Here's the cause of the bug using the provided information:
   (a). The `info` function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the subprocess.
   (b). The failing test code expects the output of the `info` function to be in a specific format, which is not being met.
   (c). The `Popen` call and the subsequent processing of its output are not returning the expected values.
   (d). The GitHub issue indicates that this bug is causing a recursive loop, suggesting that the incorrect output from `info` is disrupting the normal behavior of the shell.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command being executed in the subprocess to return the version number in the expected format.
   - Adjust the data processing in the `info` function to correctly extract the version number from the subprocess output.
   - Update the test to reflect the expected output format based on the changes made to the `info` function.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now return the version of the fish shell in the expected format. Additionally, the test should pass with the updated code.
