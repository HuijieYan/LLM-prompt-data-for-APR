Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. It appears that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the expected output.

Bug cause: The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is not returning the expected value, resulting in an incorrect version string being returned.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the environment variable $FISH_VERSION is set properly and contains the correct version information.
2. Instead of relying on the environment variable, use a more reliable method to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = os.popen('fish --version').readline().strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code above uses the `os.popen` method to execute the `fish --version` command, which should reliably return the version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the issue and provide the correct version information.
