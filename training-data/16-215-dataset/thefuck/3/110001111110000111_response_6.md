Analysis:
The buggy function info() is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). However, the Popen command is calling 'fish' with the argument '--version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which causes the incorrect version information to be returned.

The failing test is asserting that the shell.info() should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it's actually returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' due to the incorrect Popen command.

The GitHub issue indicates that the incorrect behavior is causing a recursive loop when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses the thefuck -v command.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect command being used in the Popen call within the info() function, which results in the incorrect version information being returned.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the Popen command to use 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version' to get the correct version information.
2. Modify the info() function to parse the version information correctly to ensure it returns the expected output.
3. Make sure the fixed code passes the failing test and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove the extra text
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the Popen command is updated to use 'echo $FISH_VERSION', and the version information is parsed correctly. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
