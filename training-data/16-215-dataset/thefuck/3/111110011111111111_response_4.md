The bug is in the `info` function in the `Fish` class. The function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the command being executed is incorrect, leading to the incorrect version being retrieved.

The failing test is checking if the version string returned by the `info` function matches the expected value. The test fails because the actual output includes the word "fish," which is not expected.

The discrepancy in the expected and actual input/output variable values is due to the incorrect command being executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

The GitHub issue indicates that the problem comes from using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The actual command being used is "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" when it should be "fish --version."

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed in the `info` function to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format.

Below is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split()[-1]
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
