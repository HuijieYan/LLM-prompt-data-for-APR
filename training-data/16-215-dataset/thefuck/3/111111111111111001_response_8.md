The problem is that the command being run to get the version of the shell is incorrect. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected value.
