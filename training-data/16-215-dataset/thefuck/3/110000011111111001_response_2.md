The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It's using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This is causing the test to fail because the returned value from the function does not match the expected value.

To fix this bug, update the command in the `Popen` call to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the test should pass.
