1. The buggy function is a part of the "Fish" class in the "fish.py" file within the "thefuck" project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command and capturing its output. The GitHub issue mentions that the use of this function in the Oh-My-Fish plugin results in a hang due to a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the command execution part, where the result is captured and returned.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function "info" in the "Fish" class is using the Popen function to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell, which is then causing a recursive loop when used in the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is mentioned in the GitHub issue, where the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggers the recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking and controlling the conditions under which the command is executed, optimizing the command execution to prevent recursive loops, or using a different method to obtain the shell version.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected code, we are using the "subprocess.run" function to execute the command and capture its output. We are also using the "text=True" parameter to ensure that the output is returned as a string directly, without the need for additional decoding. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and prevent the recursive loop.
