Potential error location: The problematic line is where the `Popen` function is used to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, and the stdout is read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

Bug's cause:
(a) The `Popen` function may not be returning the expected output.
(b) The `info` function is not handling the output of the `Popen` function correctly.
(c) The class `Fish` may not be handling the output of the `info` function correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to get the output instead of direct `stdout.read()`.
2. Add error handling for the `Popen` call to handle potential errors.
3. Ensure that the `Fish` class is able to handle the output of the `info` function appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
