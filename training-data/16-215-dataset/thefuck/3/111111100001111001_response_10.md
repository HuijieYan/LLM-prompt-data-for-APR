The issue with the buggy function is that it's not importing the necessary modules for `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL`. Additionally, the command passed to `Popen` is incorrect as it's trying to run `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version of the Fish Shell.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and change the command passed to `Popen` to get the correct version of the Fish Shell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish Shell when tested with the provided input/output variable information.
