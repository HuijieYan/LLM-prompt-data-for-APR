1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. The test function for this method asserts that the output of calling the "info" method should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the version part of the output is not being extracted correctly in the "info" method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. It appears that the extraction of the version from the output of the Popen command is not working as expected.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is using the "Popen" command to execute a shell command and capture its output.
   (b). The class "Fish" itself doesn't seem to have any issue, but the "info" method within the class is not correctly extracting the version from the output of the shell command.
   (c). The failing test is expecting the output of the "info" method to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it is receiving 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead. This indicates that the version extraction is incorrect in the "info" method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the Popen command to correctly retrieve the version information from the shell.
   (b). Refactor the "info" method to extract the version information accurately.
   (c). Ensure that the extracted version is formatted correctly to match the expected output in the test function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the "info" method uses the correct arguments for the Popen command to retrieve the version information and then extracts and formats the version to match the expected output in the test function.
