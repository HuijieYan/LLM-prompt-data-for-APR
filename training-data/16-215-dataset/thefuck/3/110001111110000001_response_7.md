The potential error in the `info` function is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`.

The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the command used to retrieve the version of Fish shell in the `info` function and the command expected by the test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should use the command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the `info` function will use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and it will pass the failing test.
