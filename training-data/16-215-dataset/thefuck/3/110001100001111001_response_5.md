The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the Popen.stdout.read() method. This method returns a bytes object, so calling decode('utf-8') directly on it might result in an incorrect string. 

The cause of the bug is that the decode('utf-8') method is called on the proc.stdout.read() directly, which may lead to an incorrect decoding of the bytes object.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly decode the bytes object returned by proc.stdout.read() and then strip the whitespace. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code explicitly decodes the bytes object returned by proc.stdout.read() and then strips any whitespace, which should now result in the expected output for the given test case.
