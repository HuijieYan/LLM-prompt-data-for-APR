Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue lies in the way the function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The Popen process is not being handled correctly, which results in an incorrect version being returned.

Bug's cause:
The code is not handling the Popen process and its output correctly, which leads to the incorrect version being returned. This causes issues with the "thefuck" plugin and creates a recursive loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the Popen process and its output to ensure the correct version of the Fish shell is retrieved.
2. Implement error handling to handle any issues with the Popen process.
3. Update the function to return the version in the expected format.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return "Unknown version"
```

This corrected code properly handles the Popen process, retrieves the version using the communicate() method, and includes error handling. The function now returns the version in the expected format and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
