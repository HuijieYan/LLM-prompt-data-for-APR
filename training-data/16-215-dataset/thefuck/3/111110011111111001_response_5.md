The issue is with the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. 

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
