Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the Fish class, which is likely meant to be a subclass of the Generic class (which is not provided in the code).
2. The potential error location is the usage of Popen without importing it or any related modules. 
3. Cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function is trying to use Popen, stdout, and other related modules without importing them.
   (b). The Fish class appears to be intended for interacting with the Fish shell, but the function is not correctly executing the command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary modules (Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL) from the subprocess module to use them in the `info` function.
2. Handle any potential exceptions or errors that may arise from using subprocess.Popen.
3. Ensure the function captures and returns the correct Fish shell version.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    # the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "An error occurred while retrieving the Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

The corrected code imports the necessary modules from the subprocess module, handles any potential exceptions that may occur during the subprocess call, and retrieves the correct Fish shell version before returning it.
