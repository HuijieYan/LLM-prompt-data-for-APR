Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`. The expected output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `Fish Shell 3.5.9`.

Bug's Cause:
The issue seems to be with the formatting of the version string. The function is returning 'Fish Shell' instead of 'fish, version'. This is causing the recursive loop and hanging the initialization process.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the return statement to format the version string correctly.
2. Include the correct version string in the return statement.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code will format the version string correctly and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the hanging issue during the initialization process in the Fish shell.
