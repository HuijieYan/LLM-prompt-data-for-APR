1. The buggy function "info" is within the "Fish" class, which is used to get the version of the Fish shell. The failing test function "test_info" checks if the function returns the correct version information of the Fish shell. The error message shows that the function is returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9". The GitHub issue refers to a recursive loop issue when using TheFuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the version is being extracted from the output of the shell command.

3. (a) The buggy function is not correctly formatting the version string by not properly parsing the output of the shell command.
   (b) The class "Fish" is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell using the "info" method.
   (c) The failing test checks if the version returned by the "info" method matches the expected version. The error message indicates that the actual version does not match the expected version.
   (d) The GitHub issue states that the usage of TheFuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to the "Fish.info()" method.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly parse the output of the shell command to extract the version information. Additionally, the recursive loop issue related to using TheFuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish needs to be addressed.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the above correction, the function should pass the failing test and no longer trigger the recursive loop issue with the usage of TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish.
