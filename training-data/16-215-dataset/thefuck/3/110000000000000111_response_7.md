1. The buggy function `info` is a method of an object as it uses `self` as a parameter, but it does not seem to be a method that belongs to any specific class. The function uses the Popen module to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

2. The potential error in the function is the usage of Popen without importing it from the subprocess module.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the TheFuck plugin is used with the verbose flag `-v`, it triggers a recursive loop due to the `info` method in the `shells/fish.py` file. This is because the `info` method is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but the implementation using Popen to execute a command results in unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without using Popen, or to re-implement the `info` method to avoid the recursive loop triggered by the TheFuck plugin.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `subprocess` module is imported, and the `info` method uses `subprocess.check_output` to directly execute the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This should successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub by avoiding the recursive loop triggered by the TheFuck plugin.
