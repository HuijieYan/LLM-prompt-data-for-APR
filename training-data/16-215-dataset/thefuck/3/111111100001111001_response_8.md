Potential error location:
The potential error is in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' only returns the version number, but the expected output includes the string 'fish, version', which is missing in the current implementation.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version does not include the string 'fish, version', which is expected in the output. This causes the mismatch between the expected and actual output values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be modified to include the string 'fish, version' in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'{}'.format(version)
```

This code modifies the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to include the string 'fish, version' in the output, which now satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
