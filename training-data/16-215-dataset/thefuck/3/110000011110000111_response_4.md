1. The buggy function `info` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test is checking whether the `info` function returns the expected string "Fish Shell <version>". The error message indicates that the returned string includes more than just the version number, which causes the assertion to fail. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem might be related to a recursive loop triggered by `info` function, possibly due to the use of the `thefuck -v` command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `Popen` call, where the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command is being captured.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function:
   The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command, captures the output, and then returns a string containing the version. However, it seems that the output of the command is not correctly processed, resulting in a string that includes more information than just the version number.

   (b). The failing test and error message:
   The failing test sets up the `Popen` mock to simulate the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the actual returned string includes more information than expected.

   (c). The GitHub Issue information:
   The GitHub issue suggests that the `info` function might be causing a recursive loop, possibly due to the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering the `info` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `Popen` call to correctly capture only the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.
   - Ensure that the `info` function only returns the version number without any additional information.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function processes the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to extract only the version number and returns the expected string. This should resolve the failing test and also address the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
