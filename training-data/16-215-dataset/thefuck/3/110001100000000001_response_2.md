1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within a class, likely related to a shell. It is trying to fetch the version of the current shell (Fish Shell) and return it.

2. The potential error location is likely with the Popen call, as it may not be capturing the output of the command properly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is not capturing the output of the command properly. The stdout is not being captured, and the version variable is not being properly assigned.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Capture the output of the command properly using communicate() method of the Popen object.
   - Add error handling to deal with any issues that may arise during the command execution.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
