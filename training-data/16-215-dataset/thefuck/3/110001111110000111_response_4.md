1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related functions, test code, and corresponding error message, the GitHub issue:

- The `info` function in the file `fish.py` returns the name and version of the current shell, 'Fish Shell.'
- The failing test function `test_info` in the file `test_fish.py` uses `Popen` to simulate the output of the `fish --version` command and checks if the expected version is returned by the `info` function.
- The error message indicates that the expected output is not matching the actual output returned by the `info` function.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the problem lies in the recursive loop triggered by using `thefuck -v` in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function:

The potential error location within the `info` function is in the line where the version is being extracted from the output of the `fish --version` command.

3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:

(a). The buggy function:
The `info` function simply retrieves the version using `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then tries to format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'.

(b). The related functions:
The failing test simulates the output of `fish --version` and checks if the expected version is returned.

(c). The failing test and error message:
The failing test is expecting 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but receiving 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' because the version extraction is incorrect.

(d). The GitHub issue information:
The GitHub issue suggests that there is a problem with using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, which may be related to the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

- Update the `info` function to correctly parse the version from the output of the `fish --version` command.
- Handle the recursive loop triggered by using `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_match = re.search(r'version (\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', version_output)
    if version_match:
        version = version_match.group(1)
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
    else:
        return 'Fish Shell <version>'
```
This corrected code uses regular expression to correctly parse the version from the output of the `fish --version` command. It also addresses the recursive loop issue triggered by using `thefuck -v` with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
