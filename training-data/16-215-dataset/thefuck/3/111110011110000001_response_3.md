The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. This method is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish shell being used. The method uses the Popen class to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version. 

The failing test is checking if the "info" method returns the expected result, which is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The error message indicates that the method is actually returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', which is not the expected output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following line:
```
return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
The method is incorrectly formatting the version string, leading to the additional 'fish, version' text in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the method to correctly format the version string. One possible approach is to modify the command being executed using Popen to retrieve only the version number without any additional text.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In this corrected code, we modified the command passed to Popen to retrieve the version number only. Then, we used the `communicate()` method to retrieve the output and extracted the version number using `split()`. This corrected code should pass the failing test and return the expected output.
