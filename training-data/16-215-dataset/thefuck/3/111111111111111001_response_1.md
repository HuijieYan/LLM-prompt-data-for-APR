The problem in the code is that it's using the wrong command to get the fish version. It's using "echo $FISH_VERSION", but it should be using "fish --version" instead, as specified in the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

This code now uses the correct command "fish --version" and correctly extracts the version number from the output. With this correction, the failing test should pass and the function should return the expected output.
