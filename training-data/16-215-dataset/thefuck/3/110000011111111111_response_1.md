The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen. It should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

The cause of the bug is that the info function is not correctly obtaining the Fish shell version. This is resulting in the test failing because the expected value does not match the actual output.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen needs to be updated to 'fish --version' in order to correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell.

Additionally, the corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This in turn will resolve the issue posted in GitHub about the Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin triggering a recursive loop.
