1. The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, it seems to be missing the necessary imports such as Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the Popen function is being used to run the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

3. The bug's cause is that the necessary imports for Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL are missing. The Popen function also needs to be called with shell=True in order to run the specified shell command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding the necessary imports and modifying the Popen function call to include shell=True.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
