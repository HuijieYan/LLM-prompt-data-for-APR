1. The buggy function is a method in the 'fish.py' file under the 'thefuck/shells' directory. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command to get the fish version. The issue seems to be with how the command output is being read and decoded.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the output from the 'fish' command is being read and decoded.

3. (a) The buggy function tries to get the Fish version by running the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and then reading the output. However, the decoding process might not be handling the output correctly.
   (b) The function uses the Popen class to run the 'fish' command and capture its output, but the way it reads and decodes the output is likely causing the bug.

4. To fix the bug, we can change the way the output is read and decoded. We can also handle any potential errors that might occur during the command execution.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error retrieving Fish shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In the corrected code, we use the `subprocess` module to run the 'fish' command and capture its output. We also handle any potential errors that might occur during the command execution.
