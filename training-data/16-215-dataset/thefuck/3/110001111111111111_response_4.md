The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is incorrect and should be replaced with '--version' to get the correct version of Fish shell. This is evident from the expected and actual input/output variable information, as well as the failing test and error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the 'info' function to retrieve the Fish shell version using '--version'.
2. Use the correct command to populate the 'version' variable with the expected version string.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
