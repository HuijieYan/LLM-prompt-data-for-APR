The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is used, but it should be 'fish --version' to get the version information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and fix the issue with retrieving the fish shell version.
