The potential error in the problematic function is with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the version number to be extracted using the '--version' flag.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to 'fish --version' and then the output should be parsed to extract the version number. Additionally, the 'stderr=DEVNULL' part should be removed as it is not required for this command.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and it should pass the failing test.
