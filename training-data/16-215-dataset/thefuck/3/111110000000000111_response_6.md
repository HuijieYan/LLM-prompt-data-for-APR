1. The buggy function is part of a class called Fish, which seems to be a custom implementation of a shell. The function 'info' is meant to return the name and version of the current shell, but it uses the Popen function to execute a command and fetch the shell version, which is resulting in a hang or recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of Popen and PIPE, which may be causing the hang or recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function is not being handled properly, leading to a recursive loop. The class Fish seems to be a custom shell implementation and the GitHub issue suggests that the plugin "TheFuck" triggers a hang due to the 'info' function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include handling the Popen function properly, ensuring that it does not result in a hang or recursive loop. Another approach could be to find an alternative way to fetch the shell version without causing a hang. Additionally, it may be necessary to modify the behavior of the class to prevent the hang triggered by the 'TheFuck' plugin.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected code uses the Python subprocess module's 'run' function instead of 'Popen' to execute the command and fetch the shell version. It also specifies 'text=True' to handle the output as text. This should prevent the hang or recursive loop caused by the original implementation.
