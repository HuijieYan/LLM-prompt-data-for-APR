The issue with the `info` function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes to use `Generic`, `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL`. Additionally, the function is missing a `from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL` and `from typing import Generic` import statement at the beginning of the file.

To fix this issue, the following changes need to be made:
1. Import the necessary modules and classes at the beginning of the file.
2. Update the `info` function to use `subprocess.Popen` instead of just `Popen`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the `info` function should now work as expected and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
