The potential error location within the problematic function is in the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' may not return the expected value, resulting in the discrepancy between the actual and expected output.


The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to the failing test. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but the command used to fetch the version is not accurate, resulting in an incorrect version being returned.


To fix the bug, the command used to get the Fish shell version should be updated to fetch the correct version information. Additionally, the assertion in the failing test should be modified to match the expected output based on the corrected command.


Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct Fish Shell version, and the failing test should pass. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
