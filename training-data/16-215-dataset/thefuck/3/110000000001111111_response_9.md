Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The Popen function is used to run a command and capture its output, but it seems to be returning incorrect output.

Bug's Cause:
The Popen command is not capturing the correct output for the Fish shell version.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use subprocess.run() instead of Popen to get the output of the command.
2. Check if the environment variable $FISH_VERSION is set correctly for the shell.

Corrected Code:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True, text=True)
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.stdout.strip())
```
