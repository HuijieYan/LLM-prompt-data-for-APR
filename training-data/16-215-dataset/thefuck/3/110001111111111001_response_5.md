The bug in the `info` function is due to the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is currently using `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the expected command is `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command being executed by `Popen` to fetch the correct version.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With the above correction, the function will now execute the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version, and it should pass the failing test.
