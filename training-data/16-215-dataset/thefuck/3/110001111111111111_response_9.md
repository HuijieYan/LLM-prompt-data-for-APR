The problem in the `info` function is that it is using the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version. The function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, while the correct command is `fish --version`.

The failing test is asserting that the output of `shell.info()` should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this change, the function should now return the correct version string and pass the failing test. The updated function will also return the expected version, as well as satisfy the input/output variable information provided.

This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the usage of the function `info` triggering a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
