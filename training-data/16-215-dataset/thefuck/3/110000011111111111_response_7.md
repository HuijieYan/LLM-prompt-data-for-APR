1. The bug is likely located in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The failing test is checking if the function returns the expected version of the Fish shell. The expected version is "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the function is currently returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This discrepancy is most likely the cause of the failing test.

2. The potential error is in how the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" is being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect command being passed to the Popen function. The expected version of the Fish shell is "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the function is currently returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This discrepancy is causing the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Changing the command passed to Popen to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
   - Modifying how the version string is constructed to ensure it matches the expected format.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
