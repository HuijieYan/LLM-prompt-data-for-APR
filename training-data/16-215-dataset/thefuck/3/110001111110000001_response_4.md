The potential error location within the problematic function is in the Popen call, where the command being executed is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version'. This is also evident from the failing test where the assertion checks for 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual result includes the unnecessary 'fish, version' text.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed in the Popen call does not retrieve the actual version of the Fish shell in the expected format.

To fix the bug, the command in the Popen call should be changed from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to '--version' so that the correct version information is retrieved. Additionally, the format of the returned string should be adjusted to match the expected 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test.
