Potential error location: The `Popen` command is not correctly running the command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the `Popen` command but is not passing the correct arguments to run the command.
(b). The failing test in the `test_fish.py` file expects the `info` function to return the correct version of the Fish shell, but it fails because the version is not being retrieved correctly.
(c). The error message shows that the expected version string is not matching the actual version string returned by the `info` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `Popen` command in the `info` function to correctly run the command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Modify the `test_info` function to provide the correct version string for comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import shlex

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(shlex.split('fish --version'), stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split(', ')[1].strip()
```

With this correction, the `info` function now correctly retrieves the Fish shell version using the `Popen` command. The corrected version string is then extracted and returned, achieving the necessary output for the failing test.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test.
