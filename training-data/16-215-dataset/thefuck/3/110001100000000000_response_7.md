# The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, universal_newlines=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In this corrected version, I have imported the necessary modules from the `subprocess` library and modified the `Popen` function to use `universal_newlines=True` to allow for decoding the output as a string. I have also used the `communicate()` method to read the output and stripped any leading or trailing whitespace for the version. I have also removed the unnecessary `u` prefix before the string.
