# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The issue seems to be resolved by replacing the Popen method with subprocess.check_output and adding the import statement for the subprocess module.
