1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically the Fish shell. It uses the Popen class to run the shell command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and capture the output, which should be the version of the Fish shell.

2. The potential error location is within the Popen and stdout.read() methods, where the code attempts to capture the version of the Fish shell.

3. (a) The buggy function "info" is using the Popen class to run a shell command, but it's not handling the output properly.
   (b) The class Fish is inheriting from the Generic class and attempting to retrieve and return information about the Fish shell.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly capturing the output of the shell command and handling any errors that may occur during the process. Additionally, ensuring that the correct command is being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Error retrieving shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In the corrected code, we import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL from the subprocess module. We then use a try-except block to execute the shell command, capture the output using proc.communicate()[0], and handle any exceptions that may occur during the process. We also format the output with the version information and return it.
