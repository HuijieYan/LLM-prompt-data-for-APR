The issue with the provided code is that it is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command directly. This can cause issues, especially when running in an environment where the shell is not fully initialized. Additionally, the expected version format is different from the one being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the shell initialization properly and is not formatting the version information correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the shell is initialized properly before trying to get the version information. We can also update the formatting of the version to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-i', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if version:
        version = 'fish, version ' + version
    else:
        version = 'unknown'
    return version
```

This code checks if the version is empty and sets it to 'unknown' if it is. It also formats the version to match the expected format. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
