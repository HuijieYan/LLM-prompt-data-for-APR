1. The buggy function 'info' is part of the 'fish.py' file in the 'thefuck' project. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command and reading the output. The GitHub issue indicates that when the plugin Oh-My-Fish is used, it triggers a recursive loop due to the use of 'thefuck -v', which in turn leads to a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of 'thefuck -v' triggering a recursive loop, which causes the hang during Fish Shell initialization.

3. The cause of the bug is as follows:
   (a). The buggy function 'info' uses 'thefuck -v' to retrieve the version of the current shell.
   (b). The use of 'thefuck -v' triggers a recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish, leading to a hang during Fish Shell initialization.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that the fix is on its way and provides a reference to the specific issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Avoid using 'thefuck -v' in the 'info' function to retrieve the shell version.
   (b). Implement a different approach to get the shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop or cause a hang during initialization.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = get_fish_version()  # New function to get the Fish shell version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

def get_fish_version():
    """Returns the version of the Fish shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

By separating the logic for retrieving the Fish shell version into a new function, 'get_fish_version', we can avoid triggering the recursive loop and hang during initialization. The 'info' function now simply calls 'get_fish_version' to retrieve the version and return it. This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
