The bug in the given function is that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not returning the expected value. The actual value returned is just the version number, while the expected value includes 'fish, version' before the version number.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command to include 'fish, version' before the version number.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables in the failing test execution.
