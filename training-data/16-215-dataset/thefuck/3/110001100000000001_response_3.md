The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not correctly using the Popen function from the subprocess module to execute the shell command. This results in the function not being able to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly use the Popen function to fetch the version of the Fish shell and return it in the formatted string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we import the `subprocess` module and use `subprocess.Popen` to execute the shell command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. We set `shell=True` to ensure the command runs in a shell environment, `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` to capture the output, and `stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL` to suppress any error output. Finally, we decode the output and strip any extra whitespace to get the version, and return it in the formatted string.
