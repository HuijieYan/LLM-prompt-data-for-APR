Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the usage of Popen and proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip(). This code is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it is prone to errors such as not handling the process correctly.

Bug's cause: 
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of Popen and handling of the process to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function does not handle potential errors that may occur during the process execution.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement proper error handling to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process execution.
2. Use the subprocess.check_output() method to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, which handles errors and process execution more reliably.

Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print("Error occurred while retrieving Fish shell version:", e)
            return "Fish Shell version not available"
```
