The bug in the provided function is due to the use of a MagicMock object instead of the actual Popen object. The function is also using the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command to retrieve the version, but it does not include the 'fish' prefix in the returned value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to create a Popen object with the correct command, and then retrieve and format the version from the output.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and return the correct version of the Fish Shell.
