The problematic function is called `info` and it is part of the `Fish` class. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it currently has a bug that causes it to return an incorrect output.

The failing test checks for the expected output of the `info` function, which should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it fails with an AssertionError because the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The error message indicates that the function is not providing the expected output.

The potential error location within the `info` function is the line:
```python
proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
```
This line is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version of the fish shell, but it is not retrieving the version correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug in the `info` function is to modify the line mentioned above to directly get the version from the shell using the `--version` flag. Additionally, the decoding of the output should be handled properly and the formatting of the return statement should be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected, and the failing test should pass.
