# The fixed function after removing the recursive loop
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The function after fixing the recursive loop
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The fixed function no longer contains the recursive loop and should no longer cause the issue described in the GitHub report.
