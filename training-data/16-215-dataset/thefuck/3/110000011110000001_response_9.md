1. The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The failing test is testing the `info` function by mocking the `Popen` object to return the output of `fish --version` command. The error message shows that the expected output of the `info` function is not matching the actual output.

2. The potential error is in the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.

3. (a). The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell using an incorrect command.
   (b). The failing test checks the output of the `info` function and expects it to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command should be replaced with `fish --version`.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
