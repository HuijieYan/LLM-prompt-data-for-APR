Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command being passed to the Popen function. The command being passed is ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], which is likely not returning the expected output.

Bug's cause: The function is attempting to fetch the version of the Fish shell using a command that may not be returning the expected output. The expected value for the version variable is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual value is only `'3.5.9'`. This indicates that the command being executed is not returning the complete version string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command passed to Popen to include the 'fish' executable and the version command directly, rather than using 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
2. Use the subprocess module instead of Popen to execute the command and capture the output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
