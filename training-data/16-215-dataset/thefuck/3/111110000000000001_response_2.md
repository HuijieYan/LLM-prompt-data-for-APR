1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within a class called Fish. It is trying to get the version of the Fish shell being used.

2. The potential error location within the function is the usage of Popen without importing it.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function is used without being imported, which results in a NameError when the function is called.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the Popen function from the subprocess module. Additionally, we need to import the Generic, PIPE, and DEVNULL from the typing and subprocess modules, respectively.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
