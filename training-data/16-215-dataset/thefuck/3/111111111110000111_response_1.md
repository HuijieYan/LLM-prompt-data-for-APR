The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. The Popen call is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using 'fish --version'.

The bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function 'info' in the Fish class is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
(b) The related test function 'test_info' in the test_fish.py file is expecting the correct version to be retrieved using 'fish --version'.
(c) The failing test is showing that the retrieved version does not match the expected version, causing the assertion error.
(d) The GitHub issue indicates that the recursive loop is triggered by the use of the wrong command in the 'info' function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the 'info' function in the Fish class to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Update the 'test_info' function in the test_fish.py file to reflect the correct command used to retrieve the version.
3. Ensure that the retrieved version matches the expected version, resolving the assertion error in the failing test.
4. Address the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function 'info':
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to retrieve version
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the 'info' function will now use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, resolving the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub.
