Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The potential error in the original code was the import statement for the subprocess module, which was missing. The bug caused the code to fail because the Popen function was not recognized. By adding the correct import statement for the subprocess module, the code will work as expected.

The corrected code imports the subprocess module and uses the subprocess.Popen function to execute the command to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The stdout=subprocess.PIPE and stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL parameters are used to capture the output of the command and suppress any error messages.

Overall, the bug was caused by a missing import statement for the subprocess module, which resulted in the failure to recognize the Popen function.

The corrected code includes the necessary import statement and uses the subprocess module to execute the command and retrieve the fish shell version.
