1. The buggy function is 'info', which is part of the Fish shell class. The test function 'test_info' is testing this 'info' function by mocking the behavior of the Popen function. The error message shows that the expected output of the 'info' function does not match the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command, which uses the `info` function.

2. The potential error location within the 'info' function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. It seems that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' may not be returning the expected version number.

3. (a). The buggy function is using the Popen function to execute a command and retrieve the shell version. It then formats the output to display as 'Fish Shell version_number'.
   (b). The failing test is checking if the formatted output equals 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which is the expected version number. The error message indicates that the actual output is not matching the expected output.
   (c). The GitHub issue suggests that the recursive loop is caused by the `thefuck -v` command triggering the 'info' function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure it returns the expected version number.
   - Ensure that the 'info' function correctly parses the output of the command to format it as 'Fish Shell version_number'.
   - Avoid the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_number = version.split()[-1]  # Extract version number from the output
        return f'Fish Shell {version_number}'
```

With the corrected code, the 'info' function uses 'fish --version' to retrieve the shell version and then extracts and formats the version number to be returned. This correction should ensure that the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
