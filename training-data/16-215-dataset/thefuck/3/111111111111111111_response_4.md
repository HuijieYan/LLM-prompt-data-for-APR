The problem in the provided code is that it is trying to get the Fish shell version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the result of the command 'fish --version'. Additionally, the returned value is missing the word "version".

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to use the correct command for obtaining the Fish shell version and to format the output string to include the word "version".

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
