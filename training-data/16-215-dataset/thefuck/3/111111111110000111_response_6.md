The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being used in the Popen call, as it is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version' to get the version of the shell.

The bug's cause is that the info function in the Fish class is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. This is evident from the failing test which expects the version to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but is getting 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead. The GitHub issue also confirms that the version retrieval is causing a recursive loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the Popen call in the info function to use 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
2. Ensure that the version returned by the Popen call is properly formatted as 'Fish Shell <version>'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code will properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and should pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub by fixing the recursive loop caused by the incorrect version retrieval.
