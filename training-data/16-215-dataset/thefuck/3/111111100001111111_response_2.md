1. The buggy function `info` is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command and retrieve the shell version. The GitHub issue indicates that the function hangs when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `Popen` function and how the shell version is being retrieved.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is using the `Popen` function to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the shell version.
   (b). The function definition does not include the necessary imports for `Popen` and other related modules, so it's assumed they are imported elsewhere in the code.
   (c). There is potential discrepancy in how the shell version is being retrieved and whether it's returning the expected value.
   (d). The GitHub issue indicates that the function hangs when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses the `thefuck -v` command, suggesting a potential issue with the function's ability to handle this particular command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the `Popen` function is used correctly and if it's causing the function to hang.
   - Ensure that the function can handle the `thefuck -v` command without hanging.
   - Make sure that the function accurately retrieves and formats the shell version.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
With this corrected code, the function uses the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to retrieve the shell version and format it as expected. This should address the hanging issue and provide the correct shell version.
