1. The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command and then reading the output. However, it seems to be using a mock object for testing, which is causing the function to return incorrect values. The GitHub issue suggests that this is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function with mock objects, which is causing the incorrect output.

3. The bug's cause is the incorrect implementation of the Popen function using mock objects, which is causing the function to return incorrect values. This is leading to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the subprocess module to run the 'fish' command and capture its output, instead of using mock objects.
   - Handle any potential errors that may occur when running the 'fish' command.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return 'Fish Shell version not available'
```

This corrected code uses the subprocess module to run the 'fish' command and captures its output. It also handles any potential errors that may occur when running the command. This code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
