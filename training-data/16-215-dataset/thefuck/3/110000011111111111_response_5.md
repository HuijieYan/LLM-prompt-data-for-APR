The problem in the buggy function lies in the command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The command is 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'', which returns the version number only. However, the test is expecting the command 'fish --version' which returns the version number prefixed with 'fish, version'.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected version number contains the additional prefix 'fish, version', while the actual version number returned by the function does not have this prefix.

The GitHub issue seems to suggest that the problem is triggered by the use of the command 'thefuck -v' within the Oh-My-Fish plugin in combination with the shell info function, leading to a recursive loop.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish shell version should be updated to 'fish --version' in the info function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this updated code, the function should return the version number with the 'fish, version' prefix as expected by the failing test, and it should also resolve the recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
