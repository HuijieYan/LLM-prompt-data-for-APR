The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and reading the output. The failing test indicates that the function is returning the version string with the extra "fish, version " prefix, which is unexpected. The error message also highlights this discrepancy.

The GitHub issue suggests that the recursive loop is triggered by the use of the `thefuck -v` command in combination with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This command likely triggers the `info` function, causing the recursive loop.

The potential error location within the function is the command being executed. The function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, which is then concatenated with "Fish Shell" to form the return value. However, the command `fish --version` is expected to be used instead.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to run the correct command and process its output. Additionally, it should concatenate the "Fish Shell" prefix with the extracted version to form the expected return value.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the expected version format and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in GitHub by preventing the recursive loop.
