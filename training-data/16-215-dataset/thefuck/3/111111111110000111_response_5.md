1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish class, which is related to the implementation of the Fish shell in the thefuck plugin. The test_fish.py file contains a failing test for the info function of the Fish class. The error message indicates that the version is not being extracted correctly and is causing the assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the version is being extracted from the output of the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' is not correctly extracting the version from the shell and is returning the entire string 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Modifying the command used to extract the version from the shell.
   (b). Ensuring that the version is correctly formatted and extracted from the output.

5. Here is the corrected code for the info function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# The corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
```

This corrected code uses the command 'fish --version' to extract the version from the shell and then formats it correctly to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected. This should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
