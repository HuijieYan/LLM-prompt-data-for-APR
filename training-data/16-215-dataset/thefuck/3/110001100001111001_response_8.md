The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly capturing the version information of the Fish shell and is also not formatting the version string correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version, as well as the formatting of the version string.

To fix the bug, we can modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version from the system and properly format the version string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly capture the version information of the Fish shell and format the version string as expected. The function will also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
