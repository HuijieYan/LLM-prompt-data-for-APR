The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" instead of "fish --version". This is causing the version string to include "fish, version" as part of the output, leading to the assertion error in the test.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the version information of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])

```

With this change, the "fish --version" command will be used to retrieve the version information, and the returned string will be stripped of any unnecessary text, resulting in the correct version being returned.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
