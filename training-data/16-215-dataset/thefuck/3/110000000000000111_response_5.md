1. The buggy function `info` is a method of the `Fish` class and is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" is related to the use of the `thefuck` plugin with Oh-My-Fish, which triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` method.

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the use of the `Popen` function without importing it, and the `DEVNULL` variable is also not defined.

3. The bug causes the `info` method to hang due to the `Popen` call to the `fish` shell with the `-c` flag to echo the `FISH_VERSION`. This causes a recursive loop when used with the `thefuck` plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the necessary modules (`subprocess` and `os`) used in the function.
   - Using `subprocess.run` instead of `Popen` for better compatibility and avoiding the hanging issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` method of the `Fish` class:

```python
import subprocess
import os

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, text=True)
            return f'Fish Shell {version.stdout.strip()}'
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Error getting Fish Shell version: {str(e)}'
```

This corrected code imports the necessary modules, uses `subprocess.run` instead of `Popen` with the `text=True` parameter to decode the output, and handles any exceptions that may occur. This should resolve the hanging issue reported in the GitHub bug.
