The issue is related to the Fish Shell version hanging during initialisation when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with TheFuck. The problem seems to be with the `info` function in the `fish.py` file, which is part of the TheFuck plugin. The function attempts to retrieve the Fish Shell version using a subprocess, but it seems to be causing a recursive loop and hanging the initialisation process.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen, which is not being handled correctly, causing the hanging issue.

The bug's cause appears to be the way the `info` function in `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the Fish Shell version. This is triggering a recursive loop and causing the hanging issue during initialisation.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to retrieve the Fish Shell version in a different way, avoiding the recursive loop and hanging issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version"
```

This corrected code uses the `communicate` method on the subprocess to retrieve the output without causing a recursive loop. It also includes exception handling to handle any errors that may occur during the process. This should resolve the hanging issue during initialisation when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with TheFuck.
