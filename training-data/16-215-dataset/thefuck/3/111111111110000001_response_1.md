Potential error location: The error is likely in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`, as it is not correctly fetching the Fish shell version.

Bug cause: The `info` function is not correctly fetching the Fish shell version.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in `Popen` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.
2. Modify the test to ensure that it is testing the correct output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With these changes, the function should correctly fetch the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
