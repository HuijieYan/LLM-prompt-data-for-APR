1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell. The failing test `test_info` checks if the `info` function returns the expected value and if the `Popen` is called with the correct arguments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function:
   The function uses the `Popen` class to open a pipe to the command line, executes the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, and reads the output to get the version of the Fish shell.

   (b) The failing test and error message:
   The failing test sets up a mock to return the version string, and then checks if `shell.info()` returns the expected value. The error message indicates that the actual output from `shell.info()` does not match the expected value.

   (c) The GitHub Issue information:
   The GitHub issue states that the use of `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the `info` function's behavior, and a fix is on the way.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to get the Fish shell version.
   - Modify the `info` function to correctly extract and format the version information.
   - Verify if the `Popen` call and reading from the output are correctly implemented.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Extract the version number from the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()

    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function uses the command `fish --version` to get the correct Fish shell version, extracts the version number from the output, and returns the formatted string 'Fish Shell {version}'. This should resolve the failing test and the issue posted in GitHub.
