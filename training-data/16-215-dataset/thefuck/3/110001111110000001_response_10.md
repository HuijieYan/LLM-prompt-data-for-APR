The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. This line is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting `fish --version` to be called.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly obtaining the version of the Fish shell, as it is using a different command than what the test is expecting.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell.
2. Modify the test to expect the output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function should pass the failing test.
