1. The buggy function, info, is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command in a subprocess. The failing test is checking whether the returned version matches the expected version and also verifying the arguments passed to the Popen call.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the way it is fetching the version information from the subprocess and formatting the output.

3. The buggy function is returning the version of the Fish shell in a different format than the expected format in the test. The failure message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the version string is not being extracted correctly and is not formatted in the expected way.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to retrieve the version information in the correct format. Additionally, the version string should be extracted and formatted properly to match the expected output in the test.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test as the output will be formatted correctly as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
