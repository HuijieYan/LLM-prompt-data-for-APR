The issue with the code seems to be that it is using a MagicMock object instead of actually calling the Popen function to execute the shell command and get the version of the Fish shell. The Popen function should be executed to capture the output of the shell command.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to actually execute the shell command and capture the output.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code uses the Popen.communicate() method to capture the output of the shell command and decode it using utf-8 encoding. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected value and type of variables.
