1. The buggy function is part of a class called Fish, which seems to be related to a shell program. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command and capturing the output.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the Popen call, where it tries to run the 'fish' command and capture its version.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to how the Popen call is being used. It may not be capturing the output correctly, or there could be an issue with how the command is being run.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the Popen function call to ensure that it is capturing the output correctly.
   - Verify that the command being run ('fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION') is providing the expected output.
   - Handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the command.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish:

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except:
            return 'Failed to retrieve Fish shell version'
```
