The problem in the provided code lies in the way the version information is being retrieved from the Fish shell. The function is using the wrong command to get the version information, leading to the incorrect output and failing the test.

The error is likely in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. The correct command to get the version of the Fish shell is `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`.

The failing test is asserting that the function should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command that is used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function should return the expected value of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and pass the failing test. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the use of the shell in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
