The buggy function "info" is part of the Fish shell integration in TheFuck plugin, used to return the name and version of the current shell. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the usage of the "thefuck -v" command triggers a recursive loop due to the "Fish.info()" function, causing the Fish Shell initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin to hang.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the Popen function without properly handling the process and its output.

The cause of the bug is that the "info" function in fish.py is not properly capturing the version of the Fish shell, which leads to incorrect behavior when the "thefuck -v" command is used.

To fix the bug, the Popen function should be replaced with a try-except block to properly handle the process and its output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except:
        return "Error getting Fish shell version"
```

With these changes, the "info" function should now properly capture the version of the Fish shell and handle any errors that may occur during the process, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
