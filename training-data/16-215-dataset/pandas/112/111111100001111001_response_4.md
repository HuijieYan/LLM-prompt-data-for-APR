The potential error in the code is likely in the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping`. The buggy function attempts to check if `self.is_overlapping` is True or False, but it should actually call the method `is_overlapping` to get the correct boolean value.

The bug occurs because the function tries to access the attribute `is_overlapping` directly from the class instance `self`, whereas it should be calling the method `is_overlapping()` defined in the same class.

To fix the bug, the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` should be replaced with `if self.is_overlapping():`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged
        ...
```

By making this change, the function will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method to determine if overlapping indices exist, resolving the bug.
