It seems like the provided code may be a part of a larger module or class, but I'll focus on fixing the `get_indexer()` function. Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The source code of the buggy function
@Appender(_interval_shared_docs['class'] % dict(klass='IntervalIndex', summary='Immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side.', name=_index_doc_kwargs['name'], versionadded='0.20.0', extra_attributes='is_overlapping\nvalues\n', extra_methods='', examples=textwrap.dedent("    Examples\n    --------\n    A new ``IntervalIndex`` is typically constructed using\n    :func:`interval_range`:\n\n    >>> pd.interval_range(start=0, end=5)\n    IntervalIndex([(0, 1], (1, 2], (2, 3], (3, 4], (4, 5]],\n                  closed='right',\n                  dtype='interval[int64]')\n\n    It may also be constructed using one of the constructor\n    methods: :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_arrays`,\n    :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_breaks`, and :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_tuples`.\n\n    See further examples in the doc strings of ``interval_range`` and the\n    mentioned constructor methods.\n    ")))
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    ...
    ...

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """

        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            ...
            ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            ...
            ...
        else:
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            ...
            ...

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, I added parenthesis to `self.is_overlapping` to make it a function call, since it seems like `is_overlapping` is meant to be a method rather than an attribute. Additionally, I kept the remaining logic unchanged since I cannot see the full source code. However, I would recommend thoroughly testing the complete application for any additional bugs or issues.
