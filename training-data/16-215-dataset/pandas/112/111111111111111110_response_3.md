The issue seems to be occurring due to a problem with the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class. The `TypeError: No matching signature found` indicates that the function is unable to find a matching signature for the parameters passed to it.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Your existing logic for handling IntervalIndex
        ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Your existing logic for handling other types
        ...
    else:
        # Your existing logic for handling heterogeneous scalar index
        ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this modified version, we include `()` after `self.is_overlapping` to explicitly call the method. This may resolve the issue when trying to use it as a boolean. Additionally, the logic inside the function remains unchanged.

Once this fix is implemented, it should resolve the `TypeError: No matching signature found` issue, and the `round` method should work as expected when the columns are from a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
