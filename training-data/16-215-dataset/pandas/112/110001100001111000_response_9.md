To fix the buggy function, we need to modify the logic and return the correct value. Based on the provided information, it seems the current implementation of the function is attempting to handle overlapping indices, but it is not implemented correctly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if method and method != 'None':
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "If any method argument other than the default of None is specified as these are not yet implemented."
        )

    # Check for overlapping indices
    if self.is_overlapping:
        raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices are not yet implemented")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    else:
        # handle heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])
        return indexer
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the method is specified and raise a NotImplementedError if it is not 'None'. Then, we check for overlapping indices and handle different types of target indices accordingly, returning the correct indexer array based on the index type.

Please note that the specific implementations of some functions called within the main function are not provided in the given context, so the logic inside those functions is assumed to be correct.

This corrected version should fix the issues in the original buggy function.
