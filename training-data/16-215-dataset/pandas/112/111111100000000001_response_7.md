Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function is likely due to the implementation of the logic to handle different types of indexes and overlapping indices. It appears that the function is attempting to handle different scenarios based on the type of index provided, but the logic is not correctly implemented.

Bug's cause:
The overlapping indices handling logic seems to be incorrect, as it directly checks for `self.is_overlapping` rather than calling the `is_overlapping` method, which is available in the same class. Additionally, the condition checks for the equality of closed attributes, but the comparison seems to be incorrect. There are also issues related to handling different types of indices.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` method to get the result of whether the indices are overlapping or not.
2. Revise the logic for handling different index types, closed attributes, and subtype compatibility.
3. Properly handle scenarios where the target is a scalar index or a heterogeneous scalar index.

            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # Heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called correctly, and comparisons are fixed to handle different index types and subtype compatibility. Proper handling of scalar and heterogeneous scalar indices is also implemented.
