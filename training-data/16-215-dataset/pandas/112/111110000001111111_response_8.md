The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which indicates that there might be a problem with the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in handling CategoricalIndex data.

Upon analyzing the code and the information provided, it seems that the bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method not properly handling the case where the input `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to properly handle the case when the input `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This can be done by adding a conditional check in the method to handle this specific case.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method that should resolve the issue:

```python
# Corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the method implementation remains the same
    # ... (other parts of the method)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now properly handle the case when the input `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, allowing the `round` method to work as expected.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the `round` method works properly even with CategoricalIndex columns created from an IntervalIndex.
