Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related class and functions, as well as the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue is likely related to the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` function is responsible for indexing the target data based on the intervals present in the `IntervalIndex`. The GitHub issue is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` function not being able to handle the `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on a dataframe containing such columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Updating the `get_indexer` function to handle `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
- Ensuring that the `round` method can handle `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function to address the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target,
        method=None,
        limit=None,
        tolerance=None,
) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                    "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                    "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
            indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        else:
            # Handle other types of index
            indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have included a condition to handle `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` and call the `get_indexer` method on the `target_as_index` with the `self` object, which refers to the `IntervalIndex`. This way, both `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` created from it are handled appropriately.

By applying this correction, the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved, and the `round` method should work as expected when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
