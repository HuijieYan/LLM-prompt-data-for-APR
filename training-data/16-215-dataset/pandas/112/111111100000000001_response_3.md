Potential error location: The statement `if self.is_overlapping:` is missing parentheses to call the method `is_overlapping`.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function assumes that `is_overlapping` is a property of the current class, but it actually needs to call the method `is_overlapping` defined in the same class and not the related function `is_overlapping` defined outside the class.
(b). The buggy class has a method called `is_overlapping`, which is relevant to the condition check in the buggy function.
(c). The related function `is_overlapping` is also used in the buggy function, but it's not related to the condition check that's causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the condition check to call the method `is_overlapping` within the current class using `self.is_overlapping()` with parentheses.
2. Ensure that the method `is_overlapping` within the class is implemented correctly and returns the expected result.

Corrected code:

```python
# the corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed condition check by adding parentheses
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
With the above change, the bug in the function will be fixed by correctly calling the `is_overlapping` method within the current class.
