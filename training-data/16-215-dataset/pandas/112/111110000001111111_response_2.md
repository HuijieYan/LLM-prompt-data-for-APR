Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, specifically within the block of code that handles `IntervalIndex` as target. It is failing to handle the scenario where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `get_indexer` is not handling the scenario where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly.
(b). The buggy class `IntervalIndex` should handle the case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex as columns, but it seems to be failing in this scenario.
(c). The input/output variable information provided indicates that the `get_indexer` method is not returning the expected output when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
(d). The GitHub Issue also points out that the `round` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, indicating a related problem with the round method.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the scenario where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly.
2. Check the implementation of the `round` method to ensure it can handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue.
3. Verify the input/output handling in the `IntervalIndex` class for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):  # Check if target_as_index is CategoricalIndex
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories  # If so, use categories instead
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):  # Check if categories are IntervalIndex
                return self.get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)  # Recursively call get_indexer


        # Rest of the code remains unchanged from the original implementation

```

The corrected code handles the scenario where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex by checking if the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex and then further checking if its categories are of type IntervalIndex. If so, it recursively calls the `get_indexer` method to handle the IntervalIndex case.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub repository regarding the failure of the `round` method when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
