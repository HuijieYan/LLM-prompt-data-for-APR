The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This function is supposed to return an indexer array for the target data, indicating the position of the elements in the target data within the `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the following line:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
```

The bug's cause is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is missing a method call `()` at the end, which is leading to an incorrect evaluation of the condition. As a result, the control flow logic in the function is not working as intended, and this can lead to incorrect behavior when obtaining the index for the target data.

To fix the bug, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` needs to be changed to `if self.is_overlapping():`. This will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method and evaluate the condition based on its return value.

Corrected code:
```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the condition
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
By making this change, the buggy function should now correctly check for overlapping indices and function as intended when obtaining the indexer for the target data.
