1. The buggy function is the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. This function is responsible for returning an indexer array for the input target. It interacts with other functions such as `is_overlapping`, `left`, `right`, and `get_loc` to determine the indexer array to be returned.

2. The potential error within the problematic function could be related to the conditional checks and the indexing logic, such as the comparison between left and right indexers and the handling of different types of indexes.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in determining the indexer array for the input target. This could involve incorrect handling of overlapping indices, improper comparison of left and right indexers, and improper handling of different types of indexes.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for determining the indexer array needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. This may involve revisiting the conditional checks for overlapping indices, refining the comparison logic between left and right indexers, and improving the handling of different types of indexes.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            # Handle the comparison of left and right indexers
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, the function `is_overlapping` is called as a method to return a boolean indicating whether the intervals are overlapping. Additionally, the comparison of left and right indexers is refined, and the handling of different types of indexes is improved. Finally, the function `get_loc` is used to determine the indexer for heterogeneous scalar indexes.
