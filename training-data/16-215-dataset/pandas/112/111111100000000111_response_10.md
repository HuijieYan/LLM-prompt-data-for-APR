Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. It seems that the bug is related to the `get_indexer` function failing to handle the case when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a `TypeError` when using the `round` method on the DataFrame.

The `get_indexer` function tries to handle different types of indexes, including `IntervalIndex`, and performs various operations based on the type of index. However, it is failing to handle the case when the index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The GitHub issue also explains that the problem arises when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, causing a `TypeError`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the case when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. Ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle different types of indexes, including special cases like `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
3. Test the `get_indexer` function with various index types to ensure it can handle all cases.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # Rest of the logic to handle different types of indexes
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to handle the case when the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` with categories as an `IntervalIndex`. If so, we use the `IntervalIndex` as the `target_as_index` for further processing in the `get_indexer` function. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
