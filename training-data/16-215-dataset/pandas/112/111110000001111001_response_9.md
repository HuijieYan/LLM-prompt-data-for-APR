The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping:`. The bug is likely caused by the use of `self.is_overlapping` as a property rather than a method call, which means it's not actually evaluating whether the intervals in `self` are overlapping.

To fix the bug, we should call the `is_overlapping` method by changing `self.is_overlapping` to `self.is_overlapping()` in the conditional statement.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # <-- Change is_overlapping to is_overlapping()
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

In this corrected code, we have called the `is_overlapping` method by using `self.is_overlapping()`, which should correctly evaluate whether the intervals in `self` are overlapping.
