The issue seems to be with the comparison of the `self.is_overlapping` variable. The buggy function is not actually calling the `is_overlapping` method to check if overlapping intervals exist. Instead, it is treating `self.is_overlapping` as a boolean variable.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should call the `is_overlapping` method to check if overlapping intervals exist, and then execute the necessary logic based on the result of that method call.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the logic remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By calling the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses, we ensure that the method is actually executed, and the value returned is used to determine whether to raise the `InvalidIndexError` or continue with the rest of the logic.
