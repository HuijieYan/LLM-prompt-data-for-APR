The problem lies in the get_indexer method of the buggy function in the pandas/core/indexes/interval.py file. The error message indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found, which suggests that there might be an issue with the signature of the get_indexer method.

Looking at the failing test, it appears that when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the round method fails to execute and raises a TypeError. This is consistent with the error message and the information provided in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the get_indexer method to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, allowing the round method to work as expected.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a conditional check in the get_indexer method to handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex with IntervalIndex. We can modify the code to check for this specific scenario and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the get_indexer method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        return target.categories.get_indexer(self)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the get_indexer method will now handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and return the appropriate indexer.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
