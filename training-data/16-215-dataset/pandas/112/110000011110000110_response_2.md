```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# It seems like the provided code is a part of a bigger module and references several other imported modules and functions that are not visible here. Therefore, it is hard to fix the code without full context.

# However, if we just remove the decorator @Substitution and @Appender to get the basic function, we can do it like this:

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the code...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

Given the limited context provided, it is difficult to identify the exact bug without the entire codebase. It seems like the error might be due to the types and signatures used in the function. The TypeError: No matching signature found suggests that there might be an issue with the signature of the function get_indexer, possibly with the type of the target argument being passed to it. This could be caused by the types or how the function is being called elsewhere in the code. If the issue persists, a more detailed examination of all the related parts of the code would be needed.
