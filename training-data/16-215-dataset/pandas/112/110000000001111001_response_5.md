The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of `target_as_index` when it is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. The function is trying to compare and manipulate the left and right parts of the interval, but the logic seems incorrect.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function is not correctly handling the IntervalIndex when it is overlapping or non-overlapping.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling IntervalIndex instances needs to be revised, especially when comparing left and right parts.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return ensure_platform_int(self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values))

    indexer = []
    for key in target_as_index:
        try:
            loc = self.get_loc(key)
        except KeyError:
            loc = -1
        indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, the logic for handling IntervalIndex instances has been simplified and clarified to avoid the previous issues. The function now checks for overlapping indices and handles them separately, then proceeds to handle non-IntervalIndex instances and finally, heterogeneous scalar indices. This should address the issues identified and provide the expected output for the given input parameters and types.
