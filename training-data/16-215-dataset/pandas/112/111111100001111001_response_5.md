The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be in the if-else conditions where it checks for the type of `target_as_index` and processes it accordingly. The bug appears to be in the processing of `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`.

It seems that the code is incorrectly handling the non-overlapping case for `target_as_index` and mistakenly assigning an empty array to `indexer`. Additionally, the conditional check for `if self.is_overlapping` is using the property `is_overlapping` rather than calling the method `is_overlapping()`.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the non-overlapping case for `target_as_index`, call the method `is_overlapping()` and compare its result to `True` instead of just using the property `is_overlapping`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or isinstance(self.dtype.subtype, type) or isinstance(target_as_index.dtype.subtype, type):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            else:
                left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
                right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
                indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected function, the handling of `target_as_index` has been improved to properly process non-overlapping cases and the `is_overlapping` method is now properly called to check for overlapping indices.
