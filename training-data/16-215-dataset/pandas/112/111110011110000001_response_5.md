The problematic function is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. It is called when the `df.round()` method is invoked in the failing test. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, pointing towards an issue with the method's signature or arguments.

Upon inspecting the `get_indexer` method, it is apparent that the issue might be related to the method signature or the arguments being passed. The method is using a signature with a scalar target as an array, which might be causing the mismatch.

The bug is likely caused by a mismatch in the method signature and the arguments being passed to the `get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to review the method signature and ensure that it matches the expected input types. Additionally, the method implementation should be checked to ensure that it handles the input types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = self._get_indexer_interval_index(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        indexer = self._get_indexer_scalar_index(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = self._get_indexer_heterogeneous_scalar_index(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called as a function (`self.is_overlapping()`) to get its value. This addresses the issue with the condition in the original code. Additionally, the function has been refactored to call helper methods for handling different types of indexes, ensuring that the input types are handled correctly.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test without any `TypeError` issues.
