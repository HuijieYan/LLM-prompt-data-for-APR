1. The buggy function is within the class IntervalIndex. It is the get_indexer method and it is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for finding the indexing for the data which is causing the round method to fail when columns are of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The problematic function is trying to find the indexer for the target data which is causing the issue.

2. The potential error location is in the way the get_indexer method is handling the indexing for the target data, especially when dealing with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The get_indexer method in the IntervalIndex class is not handling the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately, which results in the round method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
   (b). The class IntervalIndex might have methods or properties that are not compatible with the round method when the columns are of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides an example where the round method fails, and it is expected to work as normal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the get_indexer method to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately.
   - Check if any other methods or properties in the IntervalIndex class are causing compatibility issues with the round method and adjust them accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    # add a condition to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_breaks(target.categories)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
By including a conditional check to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately within the get_indexer method, the issue should be resolved.
