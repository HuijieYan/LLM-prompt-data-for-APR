1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` and it is related to several other functions in the same file that it calls, such as `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `ensure_index`, `find_common_type`, `left.get_indexer`, `right.get_indexer`, `get_loc`, and `_maybe_convert_i8`. These related functions are responsible for various operations like checking the method, determining overlapping indices, converting indexes, finding common types, getting the left and right indexers, and getting the location of a key in the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different index types and the logic for determining matching indices.

3. Ellucidating the cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function is trying to handle different types of indexes, including IntervalIndex and scalar indexes. It contains complex logic to determine matching indices, which may not be working as intended.
   (b). The related functions are responsible for various operations related to index handling, like type conversion, matching, and retrieving the location of keys in the index. The buggy function calls these related functions to perform its operations, and any issues in these related functions can impact the behavior of the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Simplify the logic for handling different types of indexes and matching indices.
   (b). Review the related functions to ensure they are working correctly and providing the expected results to the buggy function.
   (c). Check for edge cases and error handling scenarios to ensure robustness.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Check the method
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Logic for handling IntervalIndex
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            # Handle different closed or incompatible subtype
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            else:
                # Handle non-overlapping indices
                left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
                right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
                indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Handle homogeneous scalar index
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Handle heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, I have made the following changes:
- Called `is_overlapping` as a method by using `self.is_overlapping()`.
- Handled the logic for different types of indices like `IntervalIndex` and scalar indexes.
- Added specific conditions and handling for each type of index.
- Implemented appropriate handling for different scenarios while ensuring robustness and correctness.
