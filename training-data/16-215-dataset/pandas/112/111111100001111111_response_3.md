The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function seems to be failing due to a type error when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The function attempts to handle different cases based on the type of `target_as_index`. It checks if `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex` and then proceeds accordingly. However, it seems that this logic might not be handling CategoricalIndex correctly.

The GitHub issue provides a specific use case where the `round` method fails when the columns of a DataFrame are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal in this scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a specific case in the `get_indexer` function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This case should ensure that the `round` method works as expected in this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function that addresses the issue:

```python
# Assuming the following imports are present
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype
from pandas.core.indexes.interval import IntervalIndex

class IntervalIndex:
    # ... (other existing code)

    def get_indexer(
            self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None,
            tolerance: Optional[Any] = None
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.dtype, CategoricalDtype):
            target_as_index = IntervalIndex(target_as_index.categories)
        
        # ... (remaining code for handling other cases)
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a specific case to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. We first check if `target_as_index` is an instance of `CategoricalIndex` and has a dtype of `CategoricalDtype`. If so, we create a new `IntervalIndex` using the categories of the CategoricalIndex. This should ensure that the `round` method works as expected for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where the `round` method was failing for a DataFrame with columns that were a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
