This function is part of the class `IntervalIndex` and is supposed to return an indexer for the given target. The potential error location within the problematic function is when comparing the `self.is_overlapping` attribute without actually evaluating the function itself. This means that the code is not checking whether intervals are overlapping or not, but is simply checking whether the function `is_overlapping` exists without calling it.

The bug is caused by not properly evaluating the `is_overlapping` attribute. The function should be called to determine if the intervals are overlapping or not. Because of this, the code is not functioning as intended and may be raising errors erroneously.

To fix the bug, the code should properly evaluate the `is_overlapping` attribute by calling the function. Additionally, any issues that arise from overlapping intervals should be handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping function to check for overlapping intervals
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` attribute is called as a function `self.is_overlapping()`, which will properly evaluate whether the intervals are overlapping or not. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function operates as intended.
