The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `get_indexer` method where `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` is called but the signature for this call is not matching.

The bug's cause lies in the fact that the `get_indexer` method is expecting a different signature for the `target` parameter.

The failing test and error message indicate that the `round` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value lies in the fact that the `get_indexer` method is not able to handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The GitHub issue confirms the problem, stating that the round method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which is not the expected output.

Approach for fixing the bug:
- Update the `get_indexer` method to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
- Ensure that the method signature matches the input parameters when calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Updated code to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories.values

        # rest of the code can remain unchanged
        # ...
        
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This updated code should now handle the scenario of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and pass the failing test, satisfying the GitHub issue's reported problem.
