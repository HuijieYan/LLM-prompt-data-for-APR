The issue in the provided code seems to be with the logic and implementation of the `get_indexer` function. Based on the input parameters and the runtime values of the variables before the return statement, it appears that the logic inside the function is not handling the cases correctly.

It seems that the function is intended to handle different cases based on the type of the `target` input parameter, but the handling of these cases might be incorrect.

A potential fix for the buggy function could involve reviewing and revising the logic inside the function to ensure that it correctly handles the different cases based on the type of the `target` input parameter. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the comparisons and conditions to ensure that the correct operations are being performed.

Without access to the complete context and related code, it's challenging to provide an exact fix, but based on the given information, the following revised version of the function could address the issues:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

It's important to thoroughly test this revised version with a variety of input cases to ensure that it works as expected and handles different scenarios correctly. Additionally, it's essential to consult and review the related code and the overall implementation to fully address the underlying issue.
