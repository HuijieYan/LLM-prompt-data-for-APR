### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` function when `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. The bug causes a `TypeError: No matching signature found` which prevents the `round` method from working properly when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The buggy function attempts to handle the case when `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`, but the implementation contains errors that lead to the `TypeError`.

The input and output variable information indicates that the function is failing to execute the logic correctly when `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. The relevant variables at the time of the function's return are consistent with this.

The GitHub issue also provides useful information, stating that the problem occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal in this scenario.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `IntervalIndex` instances in the `get_indexer` function. This improper handling leads to the `TypeError` and prevents the `round` method from working as expected with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `get_indexer` function handles cases involving `IntervalIndex` properly.
2. Verify the logic for `IntervalIndex` instances and correct any errors or inconsistencies in the implementation.
3. Address any potential data type mismatches or inconsistencies that may be causing the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Check for overlapping using the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype.subtype != target_as_index.dtype.subtype:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            # Updated the approach for non-overlapping instances
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            # Changed the comparison to use np.equal which should handle element-wise comparison
            indexer = np.where(np.equal(left_indexer, right_indexer), left_indexer, -1)
    # ...
    # (other existing cases and code remain unchanged)
    # ...
```
The corrected code includes an updated approach for handling `IntervalIndex` instances. It addresses the issues with the comparisons and logic that were leading to the `TypeError`. This corrected code aims to resolve the bug and allow the `round` method to work as expected with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`.
