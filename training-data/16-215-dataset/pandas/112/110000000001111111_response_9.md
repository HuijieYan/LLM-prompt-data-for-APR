The buggy function is the `get_indexer` function, which is part of the pandas library. The function is used to obtain indexers from the target values. The function appears to be attempting to handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex types, and there seems to be an issue with how it handles these types.

The GitHub issue provides an example of a situation in which the `round` method fails when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This suggests that there is an issue with the interaction between these types in the `get_indexer` function.

From the runtime value and type information, it is clear that the function is attempting to handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex types in different branches of the code. The issue likely stems from how these two types are being handled differently or inconsistently throughout the function.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to how the function handles different types of indexes, particularly when dealing with IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. The function's handling of these different types seems to be leading to the failure of the `round` method when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the function handles IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex types consistently throughout the code. This may involve checking for the type of the index and applying the appropriate logic based on the type. Additionally, the function should ensure that the `round` method works as expected when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we handle both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex types together, applying the appropriate logic to obtain the indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the `round` method works as expected for columns of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
