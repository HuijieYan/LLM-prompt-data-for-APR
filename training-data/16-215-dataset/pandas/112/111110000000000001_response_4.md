Based on the given code, it looks like the buggy function is a method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is trying to get the indexer for a target array based on some criteria and conditions. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the conditional check for `if self.is_overlapping:`.

The bug's cause could be that the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` is missing parentheses, causing it to always evaluate as true. This could lead to an incorrect execution path in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping` by adding parentheses around it to properly evaluate the condition. We also need to handle the logic for the `else` block where `self.is_overlapping` is false.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# import relevant libraries

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # Other methods from the class

    # this is the corrected function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # added parentheses to properly evaluate the condition
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we added parentheses to the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping():` to properly evaluate the condition. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct execution path is taken based on the value of `self.is_overlapping`.
