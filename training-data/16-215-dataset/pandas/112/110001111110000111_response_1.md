The buggy function `get_indexer` from the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is causing the TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The issue seems to be with the `get_indexer` function in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, which is being called when the `round` method is used on a DataFrame with such columns. The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" indicates that there is a type mismatch or incorrect usage of a function signature in the `get_indexer` method.

According to the failing test, the `round` method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The expected output is that it should round as normal.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: Union[pd.Series, AnyArrayLike], method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Handle the case for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.Series) and isinstance(target.dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype) and isinstance(target.array, pd.arrays.IntervalArray):
        target_as_index = target.array
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By updating the `get_indexer` method to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, the bug should be resolved. This updated code should pass the failing test and satisfy the issue reported on GitHub.
