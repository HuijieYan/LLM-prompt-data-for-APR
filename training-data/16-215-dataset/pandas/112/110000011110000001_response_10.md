1. The buggy function appears to be `get_indexer` which is attempting to round the values in the DataFrame. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is attempting to round the interval category columns in the DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_indexer` method where a `scalar_t` type is being used in the signature.

3. The bug is caused by the mismatch in the `get_indexer` method signature, as indicated by the error message:
   - The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found". This suggests that there is an issue with the method signature for `get_indexer`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the method signature for `get_indexer` and ensure it matches the expected input parameters and return type.
   - Update the method signature to match the expected input and return types.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    scalar: Any, target: Any,
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Union[None, Any]]:
    """
    Get the index for a scalar value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scalar : Any
        The scalar value to get the index for.
    target : Any
        The target value to compare against.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.ndarray, Union[None, Any]]
        The index of the scalar value in the target, along with the target value if present.
    """
    if scalar is None:
        return np.ndarray(0), None
    try:
        idx = np.where(target == scalar)[0]
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        idx = -1
    return idx, target
```

This corrected code should address the issue and allow the `get_indexer` function to pass the failing test.
