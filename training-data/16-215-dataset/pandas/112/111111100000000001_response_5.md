1. The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` defined in the class `IntervalIndex` within the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. This function calls other methods within the same class such as `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `left`, `right`, `get_loc`, and others to perform its operations. It appears to be responsible for generating an indexer for a given target based on the comparison with the `IntervalIndex` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for dealing with different types of targets and determining the appropriate indexer. The comparison between the `IntervalIndex` object and the target seems to be the core issue.

3. The bug's cause could be related to incorrect logic for comparing and generating the indexer for different types of targets. In addition, the usage of `self.is_overlapping` seems to be incorrect as it should likely be a method invocation instead of a property. There could also be issues with the comparison logic for different types of targets.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Correcting the usage of `self.is_overlapping` if it should be a method invocation instead of a property.
   - Reviewing the logic for comparing and generating the indexer for different types of targets to ensure correctness.
   - Making necessary adjustments to the comparison logic between the `IntervalIndex` object and the target to handle different cases appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# Other existing class and function definitions remain unchanged

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # Other existing class and function definitions remain unchanged

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the usage of `self.is_overlapping` has been corrected to `self.is_overlapping()`, assuming it is a method invocation. Further adjustments have not been made for the main comparison and indexing logic, but those should be reviewed and corrected based on the expected behavior.
