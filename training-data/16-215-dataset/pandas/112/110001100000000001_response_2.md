Analysis:
The buggy function is a method called get_indexer that is supposed to return an index array that can be used to index into the original index data structure. The function appears to be trying to handle different cases based on the type of index received.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it checks if the index is an IntervalIndex. The code then tries to handle different scenarios based on whether the index is an IntervalIndex or not.

The bug's cause seems to be related to how the function is handling the different scenarios for IntervalIndex and non-IntervalIndex cases. It appears that there might be issues with the logic for handling IntervalIndex, as well as some potential issues with the type conversions and array operations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for handling IntervalIndex and non-IntervalIndex cases to ensure it is correct.
2. Check the type conversions and array operations to ensure they are handling the data correctly.
3. Consider refactoring the code to separate the handling of IntervalIndex and non-IntervalIndex cases for better clarity and maintainability.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly checks if the index is overlapping using `self.is_overlapping()`. It also handles the different scenarios for IntervalIndex and non-IntervalIndex cases separately, and the type conversions and array operations have been reviewed and updated for correctness.
