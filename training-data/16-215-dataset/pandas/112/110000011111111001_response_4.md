The error message indicates a TypeError in the `get_indexer` method, specifically in the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the method signature or the method itself.

Looking at the failing test, it involves creating a DataFrame with an interval category index and then rounding the values. This likely triggers the `get_indexer` method, leading to the observed error.

The expected input/output variables for the failing test are not provided, so it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the bug. However, given that the error is related to the method signature, it's likely that the issue lies in the method itself.

To fix the bug, it seems necessary to revise the `get_indexer` method, potentially by checking the method signature and ensuring that it correctly handles the provided input, especially when dealing with interval indexes.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    # existing method code...
    
    if isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
        # handle interval index
        indexer = np.arange(len(target))
    else:
        # handle other cases
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target)
        
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, we first check if the target is of type `IntervalIndex`, and if so, we directly create an indexer using `np.arange(len(target))`. Otherwise, we fall back to the original behavior by calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target)`.

This approach ensures that the method can handle interval indexes correctly and should address the TypeError observed in the failing test.

Please note that this is just a hypothetical fix and may require further testing to ensure it fully resolves the issue and doesn't introduce any new problems.
