Upon analyzing the provided information, it appears that the error is related to the method signature mismatch in the `get_indexer` function when columns are of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `pd.IntervalIndex`. This causes the `round` method to fail when applied to a DataFrame with such columns.

The failing test code creates a DataFrame with columns of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` which leads to the `round` method failing with the error message "TypeError: No matching signature found".

The GitHub issue also clearly describes the problem where the `round` method fails for a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to handle the `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `pd.IntervalIndex` correctly, such that the `round` method can be applied without any issues.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the `get_indexer` function to handle the case where the columns are of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `pd.IntervalIndex` by adding a conditional check and appropriate handling for this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if isinstance(self, pd.IntervalIndex) and isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle the case when columns are of type pd.CategoricalIndex created from a pd.IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target.codes)
        indexer = target_as_index.values - 1
    else:
        self._check_method(method)
        # Rest of the original implementation remains the same
        ...
```

With this updated `get_indexer` function, the `round` method should work correctly for a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

This change should also address the issue described in the GitHub bug report, and the failing test should pass with the corrected `get_indexer` implementation.
