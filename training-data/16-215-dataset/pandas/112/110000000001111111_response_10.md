### Analysis
The buggy function is `get_indexer` from pandas library. The function is used to retrieve the index of the target elements within the index of the object. The provided runtime values and types indicate that the function is failing to handle the case when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which aligns with the GitHub issue's description. The function is encountering a TypeError when `df2.round()` is called.

### Bug Location
The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of `target_as_index` when it is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The function seems to be unable to process this specific type of index, leading to the TypeError.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not being able to handle the specific type of index (CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex) when calculating the indexer. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the `round` method fails in a similar scenario.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function `get_indexer` to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex appropriately by including a conditional check and specialized handling for this specific case. This would ensure that the function can handle all types of indexes, including CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, an additional conditional check has been added to handle the case where `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, the function replaces `target_as_index` with `target_as_index.categories` to ensure that it correctly processes the index. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
