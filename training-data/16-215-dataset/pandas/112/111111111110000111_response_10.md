The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method of the IntervalIndex class. It is failing with a TypeError "No matching signature found" when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is leading to the failure of the `df.round()` method in the test.

The problem seems to be related to the way the `get_indexer` method is handling the target index. This issue is discussed in the GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex". 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve updating the `get_indexer` method to handle IntervalIndex when the columns are a CategoricalIndex. This could involve modifying the logic to properly handle the CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex combination.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# This is the corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target = target.categories

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method checks if the target index is a CategoricalIndex and if so, retrieves the categories to use as the target. This updated logic should address the issue when using IntervalIndex with CategoricalIndex and should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
