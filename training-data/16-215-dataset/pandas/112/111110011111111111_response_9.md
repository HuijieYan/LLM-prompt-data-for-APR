The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the `get_indexer` method, as indicated by the error message `TypeError: No matching signature found`. This suggests an issue with the method signature or its usage.

The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the class `IntervalIndex`, and it is called when rounding the DataFrame with interval columns. The error message shows that the method signature is not matching, which is likely causing the failure.

The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The `df.round()` call is failing due to the `get_indexer` method issue. The expected output is that the rounding should work as normal.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix this issue, the `get_indexer` method should be modified to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly and return the correct indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: scalar_t,
) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # modified logic to handle CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
            indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = super().get_indexer(target)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target)
    
    return indexer
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle the case when the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and return the correct indexer accordingly. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
