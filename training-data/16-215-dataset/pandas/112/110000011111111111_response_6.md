1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is failing due to a TypeError: No matching signature found, which is related to the `get_indexer` method's signature not matching the input parameters when columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `get_indexer` method when it tries to retrieve the indexer using the `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This is where the mismatch between the signature and the input parameters is occurring.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `get_indexer` tries to retrieve the indexer using a target index that is of type `IntervalIndex`. When this is converted to a categorical index, the method fails to match the signature and input parameters.
   (b). The failing test provides an example of creating a dataframe with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and then calling the `round` method, which triggers the error.
   (c). The expected behavior is that the `round` method should work as normal for such columns, but it fails with a TypeError due to the mismatch in method signature and input parameters.
   (d). The GitHub issue details the problem with a reproducible code sample and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the signature of the `get_indexer` method to handle the input parameters when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   (b). Add type checking and conversion logic to handle the different types of indexes and ensure the method can handle them appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index._codes
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        # remaining code as is
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, we handle the case where the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` by extracting the `_codes` attribute and then passing it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This ensures that the method's signature matches the input parameters and can handle columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This correction should resolve the issue and make the `round` method work as expected in the failing test case, as well as satisfy the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
