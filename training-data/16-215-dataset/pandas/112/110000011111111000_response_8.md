The issue with the buggy function is that it is not able to handle the correct method signature during method call. We need to fix the method signature to resolve the error.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Any, Optional
import numpy as np

def get_indexer(self, target: Any, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we removed the decorator annotations and focused on defining the function with the correct method signature and return type.

With this correction, the function should be able to handle the method call correctly and resolve the TypeError identified in the failing test.
