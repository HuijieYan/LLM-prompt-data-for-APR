The bug is likely located in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the section where it determines the type of the key passed for grouping by the columns. The function fails to correctly handle a single column name provided as a string within a list when grouping along the columns (axis=1). This results in a KeyError being raised when trying to group by the column name.

The input parameter 'key' is expected to be a string or a list of strings representing the column names to group by. However, the function does not handle a string within a list properly, causing the KeyError.

The GitHub issue, titled "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)", clearly describes the problem and the unexpected error raised when attempting to group by the column name using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Modify the section in the `_get_grouper` function where it handles the 'key' parameter to correctly handle a string within a list, which represents the column name for grouping.
2. Perform a check for a list containing only one element (a string) and handle it appropriately to avoid raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling the case where key is a string within a list
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = key[0]  # Extract the string from the list
       
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle the case where a string within a list is provided as the 'key' parameter for grouping along the columns (axis=1), resolving the KeyError and passing the failing test.
