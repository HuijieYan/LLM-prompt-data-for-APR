The potential error in the `_get_grouper` function is likely caused by the way it handles the `key` parameter, especially when it is a list. The function seems to incorrectly process the `key` and does not handle the case where `key` is a list properly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the case where `key` is a list, and ensure that all the key values are processed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as: index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key  # store the list of keys
    else:
        keys = [key]  # make sure keys is a list for consistency

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the case where `key` is a list. This should address the issue that was causing the failing test.
