The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is due to the incorrect handling of grouping by column names when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. The function fails to recognize the column name and mistakenly treats it as an index or level.

The issue is related to the `key` parameter, where the function incorrectly handles a list of columns names.

The failing test code demonstrates that the `groupby` with `axis=1` and a single column name as the key is not working as expected. The `KeyError` is raised for the provided column name, indicating that the function fails to recognize it.

The GitHub issue further confirms the problem, stating that the grouping operation by column name is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to correctly handle the case when grouping by column names with `axis=1`. It should properly recognize the provided column names and create the grouper accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Convert single column name to a list

    if key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
            keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
            levels = level if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)) else [level] * len(keys)

            if all(n in obj.columns or n in obj.index.names for n in keys):  # Check if all keys are in columns or index names
                groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, keys[i], obj=obj, level=levels[i], sort=sort, observed=observed) for i in range(len(keys))]
                return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names with `axis=1` and pass the failing test. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well.

The corrected function handles the provided column names, creates groupings accordingly, and returns the expected grouper, resolving the bug.
