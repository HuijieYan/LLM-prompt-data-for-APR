The buggy function is responsible for creating a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the unexpected KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the groupby() function with the 'by' parameter and axis=1. The expected behavior is to group by the specified columns, but the KeyError suggests that the columns are not being recognized as valid group keys.

The potential error location within the buggy function is identified in the part of the code where it handles grouping by columns. It seems that the function incorrectly handles the case when the 'by' parameter is used to group by columns, resulting in a KeyError.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle grouping by columns, causing it to raise a KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the 'by' parameter and axis=1. This issue is in line with the problem reported in the GitHub issue, where the user is experiencing an unexpected KeyError when they attempt to group by columns.

To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
1. Modifying the logic in the affected section of the code to correctly handle grouping by columns.
2. Ensuring that the function properly handles the 'by' parameter and axis=1 to group by columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    
    # Modified logic to handle grouping by columns
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Remaining code as is...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code includes a modification to handle grouping by columns when the axis is set to 1 and the 'key' parameter is a string. It correctly uses the object's attribute referenced by 'key' in that case. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and successfully handle grouping by columns as expected.
