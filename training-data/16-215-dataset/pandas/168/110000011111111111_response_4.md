The bug is likely located in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic that handles grouping by columns. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to group by the columns.

The failing test specifies that the `groupby` operation should be performed on the columns using the `axis=1`. However, the current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function does not appropriately handle this case, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to process the group keys.

Based on the input values and expected outcomes, the issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling the `key` parameter and the `axis` parameter when grouping by columns.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the expected behavior is to be able to group by columns using the groupby function with `axis=1`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be updated to correctly handle grouping by columns. This can involve checking the data type and format of the group keys, ensuring that the appropriate operations are performed based on the specified axis.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function implementation)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]

    # ... (remaining implementation)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, specific handling for `axis=1` and a single string key has been added. If the input axis is 1 and the key is a string, it checks if the key exists in the columns and retrieves the corresponding data if available. Otherwise, it behaves as before.

This corrected code should ensure that the `_get_grouper` function appropriately handles grouping by columns when `axis=1` is specified, resolving the KeyError and satisfying the expected behavior outlined in the failing test and GitHub issue.
