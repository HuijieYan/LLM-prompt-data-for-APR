The bug is likely caused by the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling grouping by column names when the value provided for the `by` parameter is a string or list of strings. This is leading to the KeyError when trying to group along the columns using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`.

The issue is a result of the groupings not being correctly initialized in the `_get_grouper` function, which is evident from the failing tests and error messages.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle grouping by column names and ensure that the Grouping objects are correctly created based on the provided `by` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Create the Grouping objects based on the provided `by` parameter
    if key is None:
        keys = [group_axis.name]
    else:
        keys = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key

    groupings = [pandas.core.groupby.grouper.Grouping(
        group_axis, gpr, name=name, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)
                 for gpr, name in zip(keys, keys)]

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = pandas.core.groupby.grouper.BaseGrouper(
        group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected code ensures that the Grouping objects are correctly created based on the provided `by` parameter. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test for grouping along the columns.

It's important to note that this approach may need additional testing to ensure that it fully addresses the issue. However, based on the information provided, this correction should resolve the problem as described in the GitHub issue.
