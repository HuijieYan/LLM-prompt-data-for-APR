The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when the `group_name` parameter is a list. This is happening because the function expects a single key, but when `group_name` is passed as a list, it is treated as a tuple. Additionally, the code that checks for unhashable elements of `key` is faulty, further contributing to the issue.

The function should be modified to properly handle the case where `group_name` is a list. Additionally, the code that checks for unhashable elements of `key` should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        # Treat key as a list of keys
        keys = list(key)
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
    
    if match_axis_length and level is None:
        # Use keys as an index replacement
        all_in_columns_index = all(
            g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
        )

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `group_name` is a list, and the KeyErrors should no longer occur.
