1. Analysis:
   The buggy function is supposed to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It seems to be failing in identifying the correct grouping according to the provided "axis" parameter.

2. Potential Error Location:
   The potential error location in the buggy function seems to be in the section that handles the "axis" parameter while trying to create the groupings.

3. Bug's Cause:
   The buggy function is unable to correctly identify the grouping when the "axis" parameter is set to 1, which is causing a KeyError during the groupby operation. This is corroborated by the failing test, which specifies that the grouping should be performed along the columns using the "axis" parameter set to 1.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   One approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the logic within the function to correctly identify the grouping when the "axis" parameter is set to 1. This might involve investigating how the function identifies and processes the columns for grouping.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    # Existing logic...

    if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = list(key)

    if isinstance(keys[0], str):
        keys = [keys]  # Convert single string key to list

    # New logic to handle grouping along columns
    if axis == 1:
        keys = [obj.columns[key] if key in obj.columns else key for key in keys]

    # Existing logic...

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
In the above corrected code, a new logic has been added to handle the case when "axis" is set to 1. It checks if the key exists in the columns and then uses the corresponding column for grouping. If it doesn't exist, it retains the original key for further processing.

By incorporating this logic, the corrected function should be able to correctly identify the grouping when the "axis" parameter is set to 1, thus addressing the bug and satisfying the failing test scenario.
