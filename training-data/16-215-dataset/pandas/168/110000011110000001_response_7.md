The error in the function `_get_grouper` is likely originating from the handling of the `key` parameter, especially when it is a list. This leads to incorrect indexing, causing a `KeyError`.

The issue stems from the `if` block checking for the `key` parameter being a list and then assigning it to `keys`, followed by checking `match_axis_length` based on the length of `keys`. This logic seems to be faulty and could lead to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `key` parameter needs to be revisited, specifically the part where it is being checked for being a list, and then later used to determine `match_axis_length`. Also, the checks for `levels` and its relationship with `key` and `level` should be reviewed to ensure correct handling.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # Correcting handling of key parameter
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Correcting handling of level and key relationship
    if isinstance(level, str):
        if obj.index.name != level:
            raise ValueError(
                "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
            )
    elif level and not isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
        level = [level]

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis

    # Correcting handling of keys and match_axis_length
    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) else key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # remaining code...
```

The corrected function includes changes to the handling of the `key`, `level`, and their relationship. It also revises the logic for determining `match_axis_length`.

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test. However, it's important to thoroughly test the function with various inputs to ensure its correctness.
