The error in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be occurring due to the way it handles the `group_name` argument in the test code. The function expects `group_name` to be a single key or a list of keys, and the way it handles this input is causing a KeyError.

The key part of the code that seems to be causing the issue is the handling of `group_name` input when it is a list. The function attempts to process it as a single key, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this, the function should correctly handle the case where `group_name` is a list of keys, ensuring that it processes each key in the list appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)

    """
    
    # The rest of the function remains the same as it was, only modified the handling of key when it is a list
    ...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grp, exc, _ = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate)
            groupings.append(grp)
            exclusions += list(exc)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    else:
        # Process key as before
        ...

    # Return the corrected grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the case where `group_name` is a list of keys correctly, avoiding the KeyError that was occurring previously. This should make the failing test pass.
