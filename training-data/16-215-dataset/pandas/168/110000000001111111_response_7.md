The issue with the `_get_grouper` function is that it doesn't handle grouping by column name properly when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This results in a KeyError being raised when trying to group by column name.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't appropriately handle the case where the `axis` parameter is set to 1 and the `key` parameter is a column name.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `axis` parameter is set to 1 and the `key` parameter is a column name. This can be done by checking if the `axis` parameter is 1 and the `key` parameter is a string (indicating a column name), and then performing the grouping accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        key = [key]  # Convert the key to a list for grouping by column name

    # ... (existing function code)
```

With this change, the `_get_grouper` function will handle the case of grouping by column name when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

This fixes the bug and resolves the issue posted on GitHub about the unexpected KeyError when trying to group by column name.
