The buggy function `_get_grouper` is a complex method that is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` calls this function to group data and perform the `sum` aggregation.

The error occurs due to the handling of the `group_name` parameter in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` method call. The `group_name` parameter can be either a string or a list of strings, which represent the columns to group by.

The potential error location is identified in the section where `group_name` is processed. The function doesn't handle the case when `group_name` is a list properly.

The bug's cause is that the function `_get_grouper` does not handle the case when `group_name` is a list containing column names for grouping.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be updated to properly handle the case when `group_name` is a list. It should also be modified to handle all the conditions mentioned in the failing test and error message.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    if not all(isinstance(k, str) for k in keys):
        raise ValueError("Group keys must be column names")

    if isinstance(keys, list):
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

        index_grouper = [group_axis.get_loc(k) for k in keys]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, index_grouper, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    else:
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, key, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    return grouper, [], obj
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case when `group_name` is a list of strings. The function checks if the `group_name` is a list, and if so, it proceeds to create a grouper for each column name in the list and then returns the grouper along with other parameters. Now, this version of the function should be able to handle both single column names and a list of column names for grouping.
