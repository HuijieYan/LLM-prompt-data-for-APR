The issue seems to be related to the `groupby` function not correctly handling the columns' names when using `axis=1` for grouping. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks if the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object. It seems to incorrectly handle the case for grouping by column names.

The bug's cause is that the `_get_grouper` function does not handle the groupby operation on columns when using `axis=1` and does not correctly process the level and key for the column grouping.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Correctly handling the case for grouping by column names in the `_get_grouper` function.
2. Ensuring that the function correctly validates and processes the level and key for column grouping when using `axis=1`.
3. Making sure that the function correctly maps the indexing and grouping operations for columns when using `axis=1`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        if axis == 1:
            # Group by columns if key is not specified and axis=1
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

This corrected code checks if the key is None and the axis is 1, it sets the key to be the group axis (i.e., the columns) for grouping by columns. This modification should ensure that the function correctly handles the groupby operation on columns when using `axis=1`.
