```
With the corrected function, the issue with grouping along the columns using `groupby` will be resolved, and the function will return the expected results for the failing tests.

Additionally, the function has been updated to handle the possibility of passing a list of group keys for grouping along the columns, and it properly checks for the presence of the keys in the columns. This should address the KeyError issue encountered in the failing tests. Lastly, the function now correctly handles the axis and level configurations, ensuring that the grouping is performed as intended.

The revised function should resolve the issue and provide the expected behavior when grouping along the specified axis.
