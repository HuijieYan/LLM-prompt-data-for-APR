The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used internally to create a `Grouping` for the `groupby` operation in the pandas library. It accepts multiple parameters, but the issue seems to be with the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list.

The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is attempting to group a DataFrame by the column name "x" and performing a sum operation on it. However, when the `group_name` is passed as a list, such as `["x"]`, it triggers the error.

The error occurs within the `_get_grouper` function on this line:
```python
raise KeyError(gpr)
```
This indicates that the function is attempting to access a key in the DataFrame that does not exist because it's treating the group name as a list rather than a single key.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified so that it properly handles the case when the `key` parameter is a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # processing the 'key' parameter when it is a list
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key] if isinstance(key, tuple) else key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
        # create a Grouping for each key in the list
        for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
            # create the Grouping
            ping = (
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=gpr,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this modification, the function will properly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list, and the corrected code should pass the failing test.
