The potential error in the function is the incorrect assignment of the 'keys' variable. In the current implementation, it assigns 'keys' as a list containing the single key value passed in. This causes issues with the subsequent checks for `match_axis_length` and other conditions that are expecting 'keys' to be a list.

To fix the bug, the 'keys' variable should be assigned as a list regardless of whether a single key or a list of keys is passed in.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...
    
    # Instead of directly assigning 'key' to 'keys', we will convert 'key' to a list
    if key is not None:
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key
    else:
        keys = []
    
    # ...
    
    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
    
    # ...
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By converting the 'key' to a list regardless of its type, the function will correctly handle both single key and multiple key scenarios. This will ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expected input/output variable information.
