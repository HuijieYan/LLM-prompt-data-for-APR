1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is a complex function responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It relies on several related functions such as `_is_label_like`, `is_in_axis`, and `is_in_obj` to perform its operations. The function contains multiple conditional blocks and variable manipulations, making it susceptible to potential errors.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the conditional blocks and variable manipulations, especially in the section where it checks if the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the conditional blocks and variable manipulations that may not be handling specific cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior in the function. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the handling of MultiIndex instances and list-like objects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the conditional blocks and variable manipulations to ensure they handle all edge cases properly.
   - Verify the handling of MultiIndex instances and list-like objects to prevent any unexpected behavior.
   - Implement appropriate error handling and validation checks to ensure the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and np.isscalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the handling of MultiIndex instances and list-like objects has been adjusted and appropriate type checks (e.g., `np.isscalar`) have been used to prevent unexpected behavior. Additionally, the conditional blocks have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure proper handling of edge cases.
