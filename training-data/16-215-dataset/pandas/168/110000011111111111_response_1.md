The potential error location is within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the part where it checks whether the `level` is compatible with the passed axis of the object.

The bug seems to be caused by the function not correctly identifying the key when grouping along the columns, resulting in a KeyError.

By examining the failing test, the key on which the groupby operation is performed is not being correctly processed when it is a list of strings, causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where the key is a list of strings, representing the column names.

The corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    groupings = []

    for gpr in key:
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where the key is a list of strings, allowing the groupby operation to be performed on the specified columns.

This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
