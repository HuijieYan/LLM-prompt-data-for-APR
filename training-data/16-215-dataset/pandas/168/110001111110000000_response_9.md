The failing test indicates that there is a KeyError when using a list as the group_name parameter. It seems that the function is not handling the list properly. Let's modify the _get_grouper function to handle the list correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By adding a condition to handle the case where the 'key' parameter is a list, we can ensure that the function processes the input correctly. This should resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
