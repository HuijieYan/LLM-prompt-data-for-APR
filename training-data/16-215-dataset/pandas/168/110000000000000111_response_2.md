1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue because it involves the GroupBy operation not correctly handling the group by columns by their name. The issue in the GitHub post is expecting to group along columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` argument, but it raises a KeyError instead, indicating that it is not recognizing the column names.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the section where it checks for the presence of the key in the object. This is where it may be failing to recognize the column names as valid keys.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). In the buggy function, the problem arises from the way it checks for the existence of the key (column name) in the object. This leads to the KeyError being raised when attempting to use the `groupby` method with `axis=1`.
   (b). The GitHub issue further confirms that the intention was to group by columns using the column names, which is not being fulfilled due to the bug in the function.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the function to correctly recognize column names as valid keys for grouping along columns.
   - Check for the presence of the keys in the columns when performing the group by operation with `axis=1`.
   - Ensure that the function correctly handles the case of grouping by column names as intended.

5. Corrected Code for the Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (rest of the function)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
            level = level[0] if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1 else level
            if key is None and not isinstance(level, str):
                level = obj.columns.get_loc(level)
            key = obj[key]

    # ... (rest of the function)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check when `level` is not None, to handle the case when `axis=1` and the `key` is present in the object's columns. This ensures that when grouping along columns, the function correctly recognizes the column names as valid keys.
