The issue likely lies in the section of the code that handles the "keys" variable, as it appears to be incorrectly determining whether or not "keys" is a list. The conditions and checks related to "keys" and "match_axis_length" need to be revisited to properly handle lists of keys.

To fix the bug, we could add additional checks to properly handle cases where "keys" is a list. We should also ensure that the "match_axis_length" variable is correctly determined based on the length of the keys and the group axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Is key a list?
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(map(is_hashable, key))

    if is_tuple:
        if all_hashable and not set(key).issubset(obj) or not all_hashable:
            keys = list(key)
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # continue with the rest of the function...

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

```

This corrected code should properly handle cases where "keys" is a list, ensure that "match_axis_length" is correctly determined, and result in the expected input/output variable information.
