The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to group a DataFrame by the column 'x' axis. The failing occurs when the column 'x' is passed as a list `['x']` in the parameter `group_name` of the failing test, which is used as `key` in the `_get_grouper` function.

From the error message, it's clear that the error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when `is_in_axis(gpr)` is called, and the `KeyError` exception is raised because the `gpr` value is `'x'`.

The potential issue causing the error is when `is_in_axis` is checking if `gpr` is in the DataFrame's items or not. The implementation of `is_in_axis` should be modified so that it properly handles the case when the input is a list.

To fix the bug, the `is_in_axis` function in the `_get_grouper` function should be updated to handle the case when the input is a list. Additionally, the logic for handling the input key when it's a list should be reviewed to ensure it's correctly processed.

Below is the corrected function with the updated `is_in_axis` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # ... (omitting the rest of the function for brevity)

    # if the actual grouper should be obj[key]
    def is_in_axis(key):
        for k in key:
            if not _is_label_like(k):
                if k not in obj._data.items:
                    return False
        return True

    # ... (omitting the rest of the function for brevity)
```

With the corrected `_get_grouper` function, it should now properly handle the case when the input `key` is a list.

This corrected function should satisfy the failing test cases and avoid the `KeyError` that was occurring.
