The issue in the function is likely related to the processing of the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is trying to handle different types of keys, including single keys, multiple keys, and grouped keys, but there are inconsistencies in how these different types of keys are being handled. This inconsistency is causing a KeyError when trying to process the keys for grouping.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle different types of keys correctly and consistently. It should also address the discrepancies in processing different key types that are leading to the KeyError.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to standardize the processing of different types of keys within the function. This could involve checking the type of the `key` parameter and then processing it accordingly. Additionally, logic for handling MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases could be revised to ensure consistency and correctness.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) else key

    if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if isinstance(gpr, Grouper):
            binner, grouper, obj = gpr._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
            if gpr.key is None:
                return grouper, [], obj
            else:
                return grouper, {gpr.key}, obj
        elif isinstance(gpr, BaseGrouper):
            return gpr, [], obj
        else:
            in_axis, name = True, gpr
            if name not in obj:
                raise KeyError(name)
            else:
                if validate:
                    obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
                gpr = obj[gpr]
                exclusions.append(name)
    
        groupings.append(Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        ))

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(
            Index([], dtype="int"),
            np.array([], dtype=np.intp)
        ))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With these changes, the function now processes the keys consistently and handles different types of keys appropriately. This should address the KeyError issue and make the function behave as expected.
