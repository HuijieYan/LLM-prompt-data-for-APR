1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library's grouper.py file and is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function takes in various parameters and based on those parameters, it tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper. The related functions in the same file, like _get_grouper, _is_label_like, is_in_axis, is_in_obj, are called by the buggy function. The GitHub issue is related to using the groupby() function along the columns and experiencing a KeyError, which is unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks for the validity of the passed level and key parameters, and also in the section where it determines the actual grouper based on the passed parameters.

3. The bug's cause is rooted in the inconsistency of how the function handles grouping by columns. The function fails to correctly interpret the "by" argument for grouping along the columns, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns using groupby(by="x", axis=1). This is in line with the GitHub issue, where the user expects the function to group by columns but experiences unexpected behavior. The related functions are used for checking if the key is label-like, and also for checking if the key is in the axis or object, which are important for correctly determining the grouper based on the passed parameters.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Reviewing the logic for determining the grouper based on the passed parameters, and specifically addressing the handling of grouping by columns.
   b. Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the columns for grouping when axis=1 is specified.
   c. Addressing any inconsistencies in how the function handles grouping by index versus grouping by columns.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        key = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
        groupings = [Grouping(obj.columns, gpr, obj=obj, level=level) for gpr in key]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj.columns, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
In the corrected code, when the axis is 1 and the key is not None, it correctly creates Groupings based on the columns for grouping, and then creates the BaseGrouper using these Groupings. This correction addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report about unexpected behavior while grouping along the columns.
