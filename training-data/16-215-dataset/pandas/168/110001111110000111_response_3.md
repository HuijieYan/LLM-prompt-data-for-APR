Analyzing the provided information, it appears that the bug is causing the groupby() method to raise a KeyError when attempting to group by columns using the axis=1 parameter. This is a deviation from the expected behavior of the method, as it should be able to group by columns based on their names.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the _get_grouper() function, specifically in the section where it checks if the key is present in the object. It may not be handling the case of grouping by columns properly, leading to the KeyError.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is processing the group_name parameter when axis=1 is specified. It seems to be unable to correctly identify and process the column names for grouping.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the function properly handles the case of grouping by columns when axis=1 is specified.
2. Check for any issues related to identifying and processing column names for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    if level is not None:
        if axis == 1:
            key = level
            level = None

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

With this correction, the _get_grouper() function should be able to correctly handle grouping by columns when the axis=1 parameter is specified.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
