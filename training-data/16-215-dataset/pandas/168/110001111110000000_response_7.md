The issue in the _get_grouper function is that it is not handling the case when the 'key' parameter is a list. The function expects a single key, but when a list of keys is passed, it fails to process it correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # The rest of the code remains the same

    # ... (existing code)

```

With this change, the function will handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly, and the failing test should pass.
