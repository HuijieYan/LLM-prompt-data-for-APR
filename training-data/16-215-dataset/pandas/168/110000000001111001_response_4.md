The issue in the code seems to be related to the manipulation of the `key` and `level` parameters within the function. It appears that there is some inconsistency and redundant logic regarding the handling of these parameters, as well as the creation of the `group_axis`.

To fix this bug, we need to streamline the logic related to `key` and `level`, and ensure that the `group_axis` is correctly created.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, pd.MultiIndex):
            level = level[0] if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1 else level
            if key is None and pd.api.types.is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                    
                if nlevels > 1:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the logic remains unchanged

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected code, we've streamlined the logic for handling the `key` and `level` parameters, and ensured that the `group_axis` is correctly created.

This should fix the issue and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
