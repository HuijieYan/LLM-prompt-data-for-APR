The bug is in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically when handling the `key` parameter. It fails to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names (e.g., `['x']`) for grouping along the columns. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the different types of inputs for the `key` parameter, such as single and multiple column names.

To fix this bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. It should extract the column(s) from the DataFrame based on the provided column name(s) and create a new Grouping object for each column. 

Additionally, the `is_tuple` logic for handling a list of keys should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, obj[key], name=key, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)]
        exclusions = []
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By modifying the function in this way, it correctly handles the case when the `key` parameter is a list of column names, such as `['x']`, allowing the `groupby` operation to work properly when grouping along the columns. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.

This corrected function should satisfy the failing test and the GitHub issue.
