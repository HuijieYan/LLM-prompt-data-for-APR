The buggy function is `_get_grouper` which is used to create and return a BaseGrouper and may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers. The failing test case `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to test the groupby operation on a DataFrame with a specific group name. The error message indicates a `KeyError` is being raised when the groupby operation is executed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the section where it is checking for the correctness of the group keys and trying to handle different cases for MultiIndex and regular index.

The bug's cause is the mishandling of the group keys (in this case, the group name 'x') and their compatibility with MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the group keys are handled correctly for both MultiIndex and regular index cases.
2. Verify the transformations of group keys to avoid raising a `KeyError`.
3. Implement appropriate error handling for the cases where the group keys are not compatible with the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # assuming the group keys are passed as a list, convert to list if not
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    # handle group keys for MultiIndex and regular index
    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and pd.api.types.is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
        elif level not in [None, 0, -1]:  # check for valid levels for regular index
            raise ValueError("level must be None, 0, or -1 for regular Index")

        level = None
        key = group_axis

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

This corrected code handles the group keys and levels appropriately for both MultiIndex and regular index cases, ensuring that a `KeyError` is not raised during the groupby operation.
