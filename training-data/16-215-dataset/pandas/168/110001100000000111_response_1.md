1. The buggy function is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It seems that the bug may be related to how the function handles grouping by columns and the relationship between the `groupby()` method and the columns in the DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks if the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object, and in the section where it handles grouping by columns.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to how the function handles grouping by columns, and it may not be correctly identifying the columns when the `groupby` is performed. This aligns with the GitHub issue where the user is expecting to group by columns, but a KeyError is being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for handling grouping by columns, verifying the code that checks if the level is compatible with the passed axis, and ensuring that the function correctly identifies the columns when grouping is performed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, pd.MultiIndex):
            if pd.api.types.is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and pd.api.types.is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
                
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

The corrected code includes some modifications to the handling of the `level` and `key` parameters, as well as converting the `is_scalar`, `is_list_like` and `pd.MultiIndex` functions to use the `pd.api.types` module for consistency. These changes aim to address the issues related to handling grouping by columns and ensuring the correct identification of columns when grouping is performed.
