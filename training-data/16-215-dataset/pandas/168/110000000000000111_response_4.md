1. The buggy _get_grouper function has several issues related to grouping data by columns, which is the same issue reported in the GitHub issue. The problem appears to stem from the fact that the function does not handle grouping by columns correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles grouping by columns, particularly the part that checks if the passed key is a Grouper or a list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle grouping by columns, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to group by columns. This is in line with the GitHub issue where the user experiences a KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correctly identifying and differentiating the passed key when grouping by columns.
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles grouping by columns, including checking for the column names and performing operations accordingly.
   - Adding appropriate error handling for cases where the key corresponds to a column and not an index.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, str) or (is_list_like(key) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key)):
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, in_axis=True)), [], obj
    
    # rest of the function remains as is
    # ...
    # ...
```

The corrected code includes a check for whether the passed key is a string or a list of strings, indicating a column name. If so, it creates a BaseGrouper with a Grouping for column grouping. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
