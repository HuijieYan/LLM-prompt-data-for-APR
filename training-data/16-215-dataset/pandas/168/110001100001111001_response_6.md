The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` input parameter. The function is expected to create a `BaseGrouper` based on the input parameters, but it seems to be failing to do so.

The function takes various input parameters and then processes them to create a `BaseGrouper` object. However, it seems to be struggling with processing the `key` parameter, which is expected to be a single value or a list, and then using it to create the grouping.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the `key` parameter, whether it is a single value or a list. This would involve creating a `BaseGrouper` based on the key, axis, and group axis information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Process key
    if key is not None:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key

        # Create BaseGrouper
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in keys:
            grouping = Grouping(group_axis, k, obj=obj, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)
            groupings.append(grouping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

        return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected code, we handle both single and list values of the `key` parameter, creating the appropriate groupings and then combining them into a `BaseGrouper` object.

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information for the provided test cases.
