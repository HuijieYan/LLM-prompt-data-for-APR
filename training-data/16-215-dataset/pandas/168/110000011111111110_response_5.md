# The bug in the _get_grouper function is related to the incorrect handling of the groupby operation along the columns when using the "axis=1" parameter. This leads to a KeyError being raised when attempting to group by columns.

To fix this bug, the _get_grouper function should correctly handle the groupby operation along the columns when the "axis=1" parameter is specified. It should also correctly identify and handle the column labels for the groupby operation, ensuring that a KeyError is not raised.

Here's the updated _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key in obj.columns:
            gpr = key
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            gpr = [col for col in key if col in obj.columns]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in columns")

        level = None
        key = gpr

    # Proceed with the rest of the function as it is

```

With this fix, the _get_grouper function will correctly handle the groupby operation along the columns, ensuring that the KeyError is not raised. This should resolve the issue with GroupBy(axis=1) not offering implicit selection by column name(s).

After implementing and testing this fix, the failing test cases should pass, and the bug should be resolved.
