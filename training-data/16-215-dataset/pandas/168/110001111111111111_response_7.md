The issue with the `groupby` function arises from the `_get_grouper` method in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. The error occurs when trying to group by column name(s) using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. The issue seems to stem from the incorrect processing of the `key` parameter when it is a single string or a list of strings representing column names.

The `_get_grouper` function should correctly identify that the `key` parameter in this case refers to the column names and create the groupings accordingly. However, it is failing to do so, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group by column name(s).

To fix this bug:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter represents column names.
2. Ensure that the groupings are created based on the column names when `axis=1`.
3. Address the discrepancy between the expected and actual output values by updating the logic for identifying the group keys and creating the groupings accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...
    
    if isinstance(key, str) or (isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1):
        key = [key]  # Ensure key is a list of column names

    # Update logic to handle grouping by column name(s) correctly
    if axis == 1:
        if key is not None and all(k in obj.columns for k in key):
            # Create groupings based on column names
            groupings = [Grouping(obj, obj[k], axis=1) for k in key]
            return BaseGrouper(obj, groupings, axis=1, sort=sort, observed=observed), [], obj

    # existing code...
```

This corrected code should handle the case of grouping by column name(s) correctly and pass the failing test case while satisfying the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
