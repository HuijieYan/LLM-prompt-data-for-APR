The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a single string versus a list of strings. The function seems to be treating the `key` parameter as a list of keys, even when it is a single string.

To fix this, we can modify the logic to handle the `key` parameter appropriately based on whether it is a single string or a list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function will handle the `key` parameter correctly, whether it is a single string or a list of strings.

This correction should address the issue and ensure that the function handles the `key` parameter appropriately, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
