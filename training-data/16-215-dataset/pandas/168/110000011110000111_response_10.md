The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function tries to figure out the passing in references and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to use the `groupby` function with a specified axis to group along the columns, but it is raising a KeyError.

The error message indicates that the function is not handling the case of grouping by column names correctly, which is why it is raising a KeyError.

The GitHub issue "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" describes the problem where when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with a specified axis, it raises a KeyError even though the intent is clearly to group by columns.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of grouping by column names. It should be able to interpret the `group_name` as a list of keys rather than a single key when using a tuple as the `group_name`. Additionally, it should handle the case of grouping by column names without raising a KeyError.

Here's a corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Interpret key as a list of keys
    elif axis == 1 and isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)  # Interpret tuple key as a list of keys

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should be able to handle grouping by column names and pass the failing test.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue as well.
