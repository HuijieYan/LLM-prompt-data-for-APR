1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is a mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It consists of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers. The function also handles the validation of the passed single level and various other edge cases.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks for the compatibility of the passed single level with the passed axis of the object and attempts to create the Grouping for each key.

3. The potential cause of the bug in the `_get_grouper` function is the mishandling of the `MultiIndex` instances and the validation of levels and keys. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Properly handle the `MultiIndex` instances and ensure that the code for non-MultiIndex cases is not impacting the MultiIndex processing.
- Refactor the code to ensure that the validation of levels and keys is done correctly for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex instances.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    
    ... (the rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # (the rest of the function remains unchanged) ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
In the corrected code, extra care is taken to handle the `MultiIndex` instances and validate the levels and keys appropriately for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases. This should address the potential issues and fix the bug.
