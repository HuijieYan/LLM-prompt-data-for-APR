The issue seems to be occurring when the `key` parameter is provided as a list, causing issues with the subsequent processes. This is leading to a `KeyError` being raised. The `level` and `key` parameters need to be handled differently based on their types.

One possible approach to fix this issue is to modify the code to handle the `key` parameter differently when it is provided as a list. It should iterate over each element in the list, treating each element as an individual key, and then combine the results from each key into a single `BaseGrouper`. The `levels` variable should also be handled accordingly based on the type of the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            g, e, _ = _get_grouper(
                obj,
                key=k,
                axis=axis,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                mutated=mutated,
                validate=False,  # Avoid validation for sub-keys
            )
            groupings.extend(g.groupings)
            exclusions.extend(e)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Continue with the rest of the function as is if key is not a list
    ...
```

With this modification, the function will handle a list of keys by iterating over each element in the list, creating a `BaseGrouper` for each key, and then combining the results into a single `BaseGrouper`.

This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
