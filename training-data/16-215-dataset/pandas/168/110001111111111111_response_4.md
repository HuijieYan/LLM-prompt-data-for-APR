The bug in the given function `_get_grouper` is that it doesn't handle the case of grouping by column names correctly. It raises a `KeyError` when attempting to group by a single column name using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. The function fails to correctly identify the provided column name as a valid group key.

The issue lies in the logic for identifying and handling the keys provided for grouping the data. It fails to correctly interpret a single column name provided as the grouping key.

To address this issue, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of grouping by column names.

Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems like the function is unable to identify and interpret the column name `'x'` as a valid grouping key when using `groupby` with `axis=1`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case of a single column name as the grouping key. This may involve checking the input key for column names and appropriately converting it into a format that can be used for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, (str, int)):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = True
    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(k, (str, int)) for k in key):
        keys = list(key)
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key value for grouping")

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this corrected logic, the `_get_grouper` function should be able to correctly interpret a single column name as a valid grouping key and handle it appropriately.

This suggested correction should allow the function to pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue by correctly interpreting and handling column names as group keys.
