The bug in the function `_get_grouper` is likely related to the internal logic for handling the `key` input when the `axis` is not `0` (i.e., not a `MultiIndex`). The function seems to handle `key` differently based on the axis but does not handle the case where `key` is a list.

The error from the failing test indicates that a `KeyError` is raised when the function tries to process the `key` input as a list.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `key` input when it's a list needs to be corrected. It should iterate over each element in the list and process them individually, combining the results at the end.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code here)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = set()
        
        for k in key:
            gpr, exc, _ = _get_grouper(obj, k, axis, level, sort, observed, mutated, validate)
            groupings.extend(gpr.groupings)
            exclusions.update(exc)

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, list(exclusions), obj


    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # already have a BaseGrouper, just return it
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # ... (remaining code here)
```

This corrected code checks if the `key` input is a list. If it is, it iterates over each element of the list and processes them individually. The results are then combined into a single `BaseGrouper` and returned.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where `key` is a list, as well as other cases, and pass the failing test.
