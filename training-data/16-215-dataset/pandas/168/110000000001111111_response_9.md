The issue with the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of grouping along columns. The function fails to correctly handle the grouping of columns, leading to unexpected behavior.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function is not correctly identifying the columns to be used for grouping. This is likely the root cause of the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where grouping along columns results in a KeyError even though the column name is valid.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping along columns. This may involve adjusting the logic around identifying and processing the column names for grouping.

The corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if key is None:
        key = obj._get_axis_name(axis)

    grouper = obj[key]
    grouper = group_axes = [grouper] if not isinstance(grouper, (list, tuple)) else grouper

    if axis == 1:
        grouper = grouper.sort_index(axis=1) if sort else grouper

    return grouper, None, obj
```

This corrected function should accurately identify the columns to be used for grouping and resolve the issue with grouping along columns that was reported in the GitHub issue.
