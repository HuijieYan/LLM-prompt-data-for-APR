The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the variable `key` is being handled. It appears that the code is assuming `key` to be a single key, but in the failing test, it is provided as a list when `group_name` is `['x']`.

The bug is caused by the assumption that `key` is a single key, which leads to a KeyError when `group_name` is provided as a list.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where `key` is provided as a list and not just as a single key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):  # if key is not a list, convert it to a list
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By handling the case where `key` is provided as a list, the corrected code will not raise a KeyError when `group_name` is provided as a list.

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
