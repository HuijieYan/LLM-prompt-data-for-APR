The potential error location within the problematic function is within the if-else block that checks the validation of level with MultiIndex. The code seems to be redundant and needs to be simplified.

The bug's cause is that the code contains redundant and overly complex logic, leading to potential errors and difficulty in understanding the code. 

To fix the bug, we can simplify the if-else block by removing redundant checks and consolidating the logic to make it easier to understand and less error-prone.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ... (remaining comments remain the same)

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # the rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the if-else block is simplified to remove redundant checks and consolidate the logic. This makes the code easier to understand and less error-prone.
