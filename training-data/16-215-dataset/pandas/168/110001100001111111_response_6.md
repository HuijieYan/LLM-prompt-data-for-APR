The bug is likely located within the _get_grouper function where the logic for grouping by columns is failing to properly handle the 'by' parameter when the axis is set to 1. This is causing a KeyError when attempting to perform a groupby on the columns of the DataFrame.

The issue seems to be related to how the function is handling the column labels when the axis is set to 1. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the 'by' parameter as referring to the columns in this case.

The expected behavior, as per the GitHub issue, is to be able to group by the columns using the 'by' parameter when the axis is set to 1.

To fix this issue, the _get_grouper function should be updated to correctly handle the 'by' parameter when the axis is set to 1. This may involve identifying the key as a column label when grouping by columns, and ensuring that the groupings are performed correctly based on the input parameters.

A possible approach to fixing this bug would be to modify the logic within the _get_grouper function to explicitly handle the case where the axis is set to 1 and the 'by' parameter should refer to the columns. This may involve updating the way column labels are identified and used for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By explicitly handling the case where the axis is set to 1 and the key is a string, we can ensure that the 'by' parameter correctly refers to the columns for grouping when the axis is set to 1. This should resolve the issue and allow the groupby operation on the columns to work as expected.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable values and successfully resolve the issue as reported in the GitHub bug description.
