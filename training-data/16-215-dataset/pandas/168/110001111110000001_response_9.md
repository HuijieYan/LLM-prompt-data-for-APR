Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function, particularly in the section where it checks for the validity of the level and key axes. The error message indicates a `KeyError` for the group name 'x' or `['x']`, which suggests that there might be an issue when trying to group by a single column named 'x'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the column name 'x' exists in the dataframe before trying to group by it.
2. Ensure that the function handles single column names correctly, whether passed as a string or a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # New check to handle single column names
        if isinstance(level, str):
            if level not in obj.columns:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of a column".format(level))

        # ... (remaining implementation)

    # ... (remaining implementation)
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle grouping by a single column name and avoid the `KeyError` that was occurring in the failing test.
