The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` based on the passed parameters. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when the function is called with `group_name` as a list, which suggests that the function is not handling the list 'group_name' correctly.

The potential error location is likely in the section where the function processes the `group_name` parameter as it pertains to the `level` and `key` variables.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function not handling the list of `group_name` correctly, possibly due to assumptions being made about the type of the parameter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle the `group_name` parameter as a list when necessary.
2. Check if the `group_name` is a list, and if so, appropriately handle it to avoid the `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code...

    # if the group_name is a list, convert it to a single key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) > 1:
            raise ValueError("multiple keys are not valid for grouping")
        key = key[0]

    # remaining existing code...
```

With this correction, the function will handle the `group_name` as a list and convert it to a single key when necessary. This will help to avoid the `KeyError` when the function is called with a list of keys.
