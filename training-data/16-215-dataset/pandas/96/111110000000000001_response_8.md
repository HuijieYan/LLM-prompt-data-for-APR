Potential error location: It seems like the potential error in the code is in the logic that adjusts the datetime object `other` based on the business hours and days.

Bug cause: The buggy function `apply` seems to have issues with the logic that adjusts the datetime object based on the business days and hours. The conditionals and loops for adjusting the datetime object may not be working as intended.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the logic that adjusts the datetime object based on business days and hours needs to be carefully reviewed and refactored to ensure it properly handles all cases and edge conditions.

Corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on the number of business days to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=bd)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if r != 0:
            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_hours > timedelta(0):
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    business_hours_left = closing_time - other
                    if remaining_hours < business_hours_left:
                        other += remaining_hours
                        remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= business_hours_left
                        other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
            else:
                while remaining_hours > timedelta(0):
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_hours_left = opening_time - other
                    if remaining_hours > business_hours_left or remaining_hours == business_hours_left:
                        other += remaining_hours
                        remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_hours -= business_hours_left
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
