1. The buggy function is within the BusinessHourMixin class. This function takes another datetime object as input and adjusts it according to the business hours defined in the class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for adjusting the datetime object to the next or previous opening time based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

3. The bug's cause is that the logic for adjusting the datetime object is complex and seems to be prone to mistakes in handling different cases. Additionally, there are potential issues with the comparison and adjustment of business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include simplifying the logic for adjusting the datetime object, handling edge cases more explicitly, and checking for potential mismatch in time comparisons.

5. Corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # simplified adjustment logic for positive and negative business days
        if n >= 0:
            while bd > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bd -= 1
        else:
            while bd < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bd += 1

        # simplified adjustment logic for remaining business hours
        while r > 0:
            bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other, self._next_opening_time(other))
            if r >= bhour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                r -= bhour
            else:
                other += timedelta(seconds=r)
                r = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the number of business days and remaining business hours, making the code more readable and potentially less error-prone.
