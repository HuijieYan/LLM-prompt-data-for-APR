Potential error location: The potential error location is in the section where the business hours are being adjusted. There are multiple checks and adjustments happening based on the value of `n`, but the logic seems to be overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

Bug's Cause: The cause of the bug might be due to inconsistencies in the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the value of `n`. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours seems to be convoluted and error-prone.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours to make it more straightforward.
2. Use clearer variable names and comments to enhance readability and maintainability of the code.
3. Write test cases to cover various scenarios and ensure the corrected function works as expected.

Corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # The logic for business hours adjustment has been simplified
        if self.n >= 0:
            # Adjusting for positive n
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjusting for negative n
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() < self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
