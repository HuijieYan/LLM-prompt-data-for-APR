To fix the buggy function, we need to make some corrections:

1. Import the datetime module to make use of the datetime class.
2. Replace "other" with "other.to_pydatetime()" to convert the Timestamp object to a datetime object.
3. Replace "n" with "self.n" to access the attribute of the class instance.
4. Replace "datetime" with "pd.Timestamp" to differentiate between the datetime class and the Timestamp class.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import datetime  # Add this import statement

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):  # Updated to check for pd.Timestamp
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = other.to_pydatetime()  # Updated to convert Timestamp to datetime
        n = self.n  # Updated to use the class attribute

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # rest of the code remains unchanged...

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After making these changes, the corrected function should handle the input properly and pass the failing test case.
