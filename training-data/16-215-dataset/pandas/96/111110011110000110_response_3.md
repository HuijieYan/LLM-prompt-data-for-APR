I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `apply` function provided in the original code is actually part of a larger class, and without knowing the full details of the class and its methods, it's difficult to provide a complete and accurate solution. However, based on the information provided, I can offer a suggestion for updating the `apply` function to handle the failing test related to holidays.

Please find below a revised version of the `apply` function. This version includes an initial implementation to handle holidays, which is not present in the original code. It's important to note that this is a simplified and hypothetical fix, and the actual fix might require a more comprehensive understanding of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and its related functionality.

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods from the class)

    # This is the revised and incomplete version of the apply function which includes handling holidays
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Existing logic to process other parameter
            n = self.n
            # Adjusting other based on n and without considering holidays

            if "holidays" in self.__dict__:
                # Handle holidays
                holidays = self.holidays
                for holiday in holidays:
                    if other.date() == holiday:
                        # Adjust other as per holiday logic, e.g., move to the next business day
                        # Replace this comment with actual holiday handling logic
                        pass

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the provided code only includes a basic structure for handling holidays and does not encompass the full logic required to handle them appropriately. Utilization of class attributes, their interactions, and the specific behavior of the `apply` method within the context of the `BusinessHourMixin` class would be necessary to implement a more accurate solution.

For an exact and comprehensive resolution, it would be best to consider the complete context of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and its related methods as part of a structured software project.
