1. The buggy function takes in a datetime object and performs calculations based on business hours. However, there are several potential issues within the function such as incorrect handling of business days, incorrect comparison of timedelta objects, and potentially incorrect adjustment of the datetime object.

2. The potential error locations within the function include the while loops where the business hour calculations are being adjusted, as well as the handling of business days and time intervals.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect calculations and adjustments within the while loops, as well as potential errors in handling business days and time intervals.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the while loops iterate correctly and adjust the datetime object as intended.
   - Checking the logic for handling business days and time intervals to ensure it accurately reflects the intended behavior.
   - Correctly comparing timedelta objects and handling the adjustments based on business hours.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Add necessary class BusinessDay and ApplyTypeError

# Add necessary function _is_on_offset, _next_opening_time, _get_closing_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, _prev_opening_time
