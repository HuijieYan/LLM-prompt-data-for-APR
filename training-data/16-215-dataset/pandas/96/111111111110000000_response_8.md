The issue in the `apply` function arises from the `isinstance` check for `other`, which should be handled using `np.datetime64`. The `other` variable should be converted from a standard Python `datetime` to `np.datetime64`.

Here's the corrected and refactored code for the `apply` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour


def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
    pass


class BusinessHourMixin:
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def next_bday(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, np.datetime64):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the `other` argument is checked using `isinstance` with `np.datetime64` type. Additionally, the unnecessary conversion of `other` to a standard Python `datetime` object inside the function is removed since the function is now expecting `np.datetime64` directly.
