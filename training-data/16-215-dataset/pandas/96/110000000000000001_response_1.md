1. The buggy function is intended to modify a datetime object based on certain conditions related to business hours. However, the function contains several potential issues, such as incorrect comparisons, misuse of variables, and incomplete logic.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function includes the section where the function is adjusting the datetime object based on the number of business days and remaining business hours. The while loops and conditions within them are particularly suspect.

3. The bug's cause is a combination of incorrect comparisons and incomplete logic within the while loops, which leads to incorrect adjustments of the datetime object. This results in the function not properly handling the calculation and adjustment of the business hours and business days.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Revising the while loops and conditions to ensure correct adjustment of business hours and business days.
   - Properly handling the edge conditions related to business hours, such as checking for the presence of nanoseconds.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
