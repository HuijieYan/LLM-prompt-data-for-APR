Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statements for adjusting the datetime 'other' based on the value of 'n'. There are two conditional blocks for 'n' being greater than or equal to 0 and 'n' being less than 0.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional blocks not properly handling the adjustments of the 'other' datetime based on the value of 'n'. There are issues with properly adjusting the datetime in both conditional blocks, leading to incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments to the 'other' datetime are correctly implemented for both positive and negative values of 'n'.
2. Properly handle the calculations and adjustments to accurately reflect the desired behavior based on the value of 'n'.

Corrected Code:
