The buggy function `apply` is a member of the class `BusinessHourMixin` and is intended to adjust the datetime value based on business hour offsets. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` indicates that the code fails when creating a `DatetimeIndex` due to a ValueError related to the frequency not conforming to the expected value.

The issue is likely within the `apply` function, where the adjustment of the date based on business hour offsets is not functioning as intended, leading to an incorrect result and the subsequent failure when creating the `DatetimeIndex` in the test.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially re-implemented to ensure it correctly adjusts the datetime based on business hour offsets.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

        # Apply the business hour offset to the datetime
        if n >= 0:
            other = offset.rollforward(other)
        else:
            other = offset.rollback(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
- The `apply` function is modified to take `self` and `other` as parameters explicitly, reflecting the intended usage.
- The logic for applying the business hour offset is adjusted using `rollforward` and `rollback` functions based on the value of `n`.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
