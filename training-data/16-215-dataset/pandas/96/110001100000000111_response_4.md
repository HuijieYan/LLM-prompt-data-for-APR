Here is the full code of the corrected `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            if self.n >= 0:
                return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should properly adjust the datetime based on business hours and holidays, addressing the issues reported in the GitHub post.
