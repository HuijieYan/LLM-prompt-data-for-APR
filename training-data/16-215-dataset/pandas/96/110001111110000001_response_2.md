The buggy function is a method called `apply` which is used for adjusting a given datetime based on certain business hour offsets. The function utilizes several other functions from the same file, such as `_is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_prev_opening_time`. However, the most probable location for the bug is within the logic for adjusting the business hours based on the input datetime.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to check the behavior of generating a date range with custom business hours. The error message indicates that there is a problem with validating the frequency, specifically with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

The bug is likely caused by an issue with adjusting the business hours and not updating the inferred frequency properly. This leads to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, triggering the error in the test.

To fix the bug:
1. Properly update the inferred frequency after adjusting the business hours.
2. Ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        
        # ...
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # update the inferred frequency based on the adjusted datetime
        inferred_freq = pd.infer_freq(other)
        other.freqstr = inferred_freq.freqstr

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the inferred frequency and ensuring it matches the passed frequency, the corrected code should pass the failing test.
