1. The buggy function is intended to adjust a given datetime object by a certain number of business hours. It checks if the input "other" is a datetime object and then proceeds to adjust it based on the number of business hours. The function then returns the adjusted datetime object.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the logic for adjusting the datetime object by business days and remaining business hours. There are multiple while loops used to iterate through and adjust the remaining business hours, and there are conditional statements to decide how the adjustments should be made.

3. The main cause of the bug could be the complexity of the adjustment logic within the function and the potential for errors in the while loops and conditional statements.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Simplifying the adjustment logic to reduce the complexity and potential for errors.
   - Refactoring the while loops and conditional statements to improve readability and reduce the likelihood of errors.
   - Testing the function with different input datetime objects and number of business hours to identify and fix any specific issues.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Assuming the apply_wraps decorator is properly defined

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (same as before)

        # Adjusting by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):  # Check if the datetime is on a business day
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)  # Move to the previous opening time
            other = other + timedelta(days=bd)  # Adjust by the number of business days

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other  # Get the remaining business hour in this time interval
            else:
                bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)  # Get the remaining business hour in this time interval

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain  # Finish adjusting if possible
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))  # Go to next business time interval
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))  # Go to next business time interval

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
