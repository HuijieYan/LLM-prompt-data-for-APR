The issue with the given code is that the `apply` function expects the `@apply_wraps` decorator to be defined and applied to the function, but the decorator is not provided. Additionally, the reference to `self.n` seems to be a mistake and should be replaced with a different variable. Below is the corrected version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # (existing functions are not shown for brevity)

    # this is the corrected function with the decorator
    @staticmethod
    def apply_wraps(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.some_variable  # Replace self.n with the correct variable
    
            # remaining code (unchanged from the original version)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
