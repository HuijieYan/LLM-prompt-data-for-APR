Apologies for the confusion, but as the original code wasn't provided, I've created a template for the fixed function based on the information provided. Please replace the comments with the actual logic required for adjusting the datetime object based on custom business hours and holidays.

```python
class CustomBusinessHour(pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Add logic to adjust the datetime object based on custom business hours and holidays
            # Make sure to handle holidays within the custom business hours
            # Ensure that the adjustments accurately reflect in the final datetime object
            # Your logic goes here

            return other  # Replace with the adjusted datetime object
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Using the CustomBusinessHour class as a corrected version of the buggy function
custom_bh = CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'])
# Then use the custom_bh instance as the frequency in the date_range function to achieve the desired behavior
```

This code provides a template for the corrected function by defining a CustomBusinessHour class with an apply method that handles the adjustments to the datetime object. The apply method includes a placeholder for the logic required to properly handle holidays within the custom business hours.
