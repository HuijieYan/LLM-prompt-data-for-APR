Analysis:
The buggy function 'apply' is part of the 'BusinessHourMixin' class and seems to be intended for applying business hour offsets to a datetime. It is called in the failing test 'test_date_range_with_custom_holidays'. The test is failing with a ValueError related to frequency validation, indicating that the datetime range generated is not as expected when using periods and adding holidays.

The function seems to have issues with adjusting for holidays and generating the datetime range correctly.

The GitHub issue further explains that when using periods and adding holidays, the datetime range is being generated incorrectly, producing more periods than expected.

Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect adjustment for holidays and the logic for generating the datetime range.

Possible Approaches:
1. Check the logic for adjusting dates when holidays are present.
2. Ensure that the datetime range generation considers holidays and periods correctly.
3. Validate the frequency and ensure that it conforms to the expected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions remain unchanged
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # the existing logic for adjusting dates
            
            # code to adjust for holidays
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            # generate range using the adjusted 'other'
            result = pd.date_range(start=other, periods=1, freq=self)
            
            return result[0]
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code, the 'apply' function now includes logic to adjust for holidays and generates the datetime range using the adjusted 'other' datetime. This should ensure that the function works correctly when applying business hour offsets with holidays.

This corrected code aims to fix the bug by properly adjusting for holidays and generating the datetime range, hopefully resolving the issue in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
