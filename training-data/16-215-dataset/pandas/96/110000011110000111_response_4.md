1. Analyzing the provided information, it can be seen that the buggy function `apply` is a part of a library, likely Pandas, and is responsible for handling business hours and dates. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to use the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, but it fails with a `ValueError`.

2. The potential error in the `apply` function could be related to the calculation of business hours, adjustments for holidays, or handling of business days.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustment for holidays and business days, which leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the `pd.date_range`.
   (b). The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range using a custom business hour frequency with holidays, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.
   (c). The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where using periods with holidays in `pd.date_range` leads to unexpected results, and replacing periods with the corresponding end resolves the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   - Checking the logic for adjusting dates with holidays and business days.
   - Ensuring that the calculation of business hours and adjustment for periods is accurate.
   - Validating the frequency to handle holidays and business days properly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Logic for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjusting other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the issues related to holidays and incorrect number of periods in the `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
