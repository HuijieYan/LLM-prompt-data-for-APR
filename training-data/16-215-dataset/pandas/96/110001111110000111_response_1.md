The buggy function is `apply` from the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The error message indicates a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method of `pandas.core.arrays.datetimes.DatetimeArray`.

The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and adding holidays. The frequency of the resulting `DatetimeIndex` is not as expected, and it includes more periods than specified.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the date adjustment logic, particularly when adding or subtracting business days and adjusting for remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, the date adjustment logic should be thoroughly reviewed. Additionally, special attention should be given to how holidays are handled in the date adjustment process.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for adding and subtracting business days, as well as adjusting for remaining business hours. Additionally, a thorough review of how holidays are handled within the date adjustment process is necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hour_start = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays, weekmask=self.weekmask)

        if n >= 0:
            # adjust for next opening time
            while not business_hour_start.onOffset(other):
                other = business_hour_start.rollforward(other)
        else:
            # adjust for previous closing time
            other = business_hour_start.rollback(other)
            while not business_hour_start.onOffset(other):
                other = business_hour_start.rollforward(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the adjustment logic has been modified to use the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods provided by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. This should properly handle the adjustment for business hours and holidays, ensuring that the resulting `DatetimeIndex` from `pd.date_range` is as expected. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
