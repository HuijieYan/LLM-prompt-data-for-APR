The buggy function is the `apply` function, which is meant to adjust a given datetime based on a custom business hour frequency. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is calling this function with a custom business hour frequency and expecting a specific output. However, the error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised during the validation of the frequency in the `_validate_frequency` method.

The potential error location within the `apply` function is likely the calculation and adjustment of the datetime based on the business hour frequency. There might be an issue with the way the adjustment is being performed, leading to an incorrect output and subsequently causing the frequency validation to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the frequency and ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior for custom business hour frequencies.
2. Checking the calculations and conditional statements within the `apply` function to identify any potential discrepancies or incorrect handling of positive and negative business hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust the datetime based on the custom business hour frequency
        adjusted_datetime = self.rollforward(other)
        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the adjustment of the datetime is performed using the `rollforward` method, which is more suitable for adjusting the datetime based on business hour frequencies. This should address the issues with the original implementation and ensure that the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` passes successfully.
