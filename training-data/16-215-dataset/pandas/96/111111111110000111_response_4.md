1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, test code, and corresponding error message, as well as the GitHub issue, we can see that the bug is related to the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday, but it is not producing the expected result. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the frequency validation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` based on the business hours and holidays. It seems that the adjustment for holidays is not properly handled, leading to an incorrect date range being generated.

3. The bug's cause is related to how the `apply` function is adjusting the datetime for holidays and business hours. It seems that the adjustment logic for holidays and business hours is not synchronized, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, the frequency validation is failing due to the incorrect date range being generated.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic for adjusting the datetime based on holidays and business hours to ensure they are harmonized.
   - Verify the frequency validation logic to ensure it handles the adjusted date ranges properly.
   - Update the apply function to properly handle the addition of holidays and maintain the expected behavior for date range generation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with necessary adjustments:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjusting timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Business days calculation
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                holidays = self.holidays or []
                while BusinessHourMixin.is_on_offset(self, other) or other.date() in holidays:
                    other = self.next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the issues mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue by properly adjusting the datetime based on holidays and business hours, and ensuring that the frequency validation logic works as expected.
