To fix the buggy function, we need to make the following modifications:

1. Import the `datetime` module in order to use the `datetime` class and the `timedelta` class.
2. Change the input argument from `self` to `cls` in the `apply` function, as it is a class method.
3. Replace `datetime` with `pd.Timestamp` and add the `nanosecond` attribute to the `pd.Timestamp` object when checking the type of `other` in the `apply` function.
4. Replace `timedelta` with `pd.Timedelta` in the logic of adjusting the business days and hours in the `apply` function.
5. Fix the usage of the `next_bday` method by using `self.next_bday()` instead of `self.next_bday` in the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Other functions and class definitions remain unchanged...

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... Other method definitions remain unchanged ...

    @classmethod
    def apply(cls, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = cls.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in cls.end or not cls._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = cls._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in cls.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not cls._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = cls._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = cls._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                cls._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(cls.start, cls.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not cls.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = cls._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        cls._get_closing_time(cls._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = cls._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = cls._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = cls._get_closing_time(
                            cls._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

These changes should address the buggy behavior and provide a corrected version of the `apply` function.
