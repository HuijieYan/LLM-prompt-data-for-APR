1. The buggy function is attempting to apply business hour offsets to a datetime object. It calls several related functions from the same file in order to determine the correct offset. The potential error location is within the while loops where the function tries to adjust the remaining business hours.

2. The potential error location is within the while loops where the function tries to adjust the remaining business hours.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of the remaining business hours in the while loops. The function is attempting to iteratively adjust the remaining business hours, but it is not handling all edge cases correctly, which leads to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that all edge cases for adjusting the remaining business hours are handled correctly within the while loops.
   - Checking for off-by-one errors or incorrect comparisons that may be causing the incorrect adjustment.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # code to reset timezone and nanosecond

        # existing code to adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle

        # existing code to adjust business days first

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
