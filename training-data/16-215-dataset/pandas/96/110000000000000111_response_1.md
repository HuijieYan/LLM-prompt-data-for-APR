1. The buggy function seems to be related to the calculation of custom business hours and adjustment for holidays. The GitHub issue also revolves around the behavior of the pandas date_range function when using custom business hours with periods and holidays.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the calculation and adjustment of business hours, especially when dealing with holidays.

3. The buggy function seems to be incorrectly calculating business hours and adjusting for holidays, leading to unexpected results in the date_range function. The GitHub issue also mentions that adding holidays results in more periods than specified, indicating a miscalculation or misadjustment in the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the calculation and adjustment logic for business hours and holidays
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles holidays and adjusts the periods accordingly
   - Debugging the function to identify and correct any miscalculations or misadjustments

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, with adjustments to properly handle business hours and holidays:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.holiday import AbstractHolidayCalendar, Holiday, nearest_workday, \
    next_monday_or_tuesday

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    def __init__(self, start='09:00', end='17:00', holidays=None, weekmask='Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri'):
        super().__init__(start=start, end=end, weekmask=weekmask)
        self.holidays = holidays

    def apply(self, other):
        if self.holidays:
            while other in self.holidays or other.weekday() >= 5:
                other = other + timedelta(days=1)
        return super().apply(other)

# Usage
holidays = [datetime(2020, 11, 26), datetime(2020, 12, 25)]  # example holidays
cbh_with_holidays = CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(start='10:00', end='16:00', holidays=holidays)

# Test the corrected function
date_range = pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=14, freq=cbh_with_holidays)
print(date_range)
```

In this corrected code, a custom business hour class is created which extends the CustomBusinessHour class and also takes into account the holidays. The apply method is adjusted to check for holidays and skip weekends. This updated function should properly handle business hours and holidays, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
