The issue seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected apply function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            sign = 1 if self.n >= 0 else -1
            other = self._adjust_for_offset(other, sign)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The code was simplified and the logic was rearranged to improve readability and avoid the unnecessary complex adjustments. This should fix the issue with the date_range function mentioned in the GitHub issue.
