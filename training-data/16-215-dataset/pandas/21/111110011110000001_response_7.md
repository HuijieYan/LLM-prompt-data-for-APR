1. The buggy function is _get_with(key) from the Series class. The failing test is testing the behavior when trying to access a non-existing key in the Series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when handling the key that does not exist in the Series.

3. The bug's cause is in the _get_with function, where it fails to raise a KeyError when the key does not exist in the Series. The failing test is checking for this behavior and the error message indicates that the function did not raise the expected KeyError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the key exists in the Series before trying to access it.
   - If the key does not exist, raise a KeyError.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code checks if the key exists in the Series' index. If the key does not exist, it raises a KeyError with a message indicating that the key is not in the index. If the key exists, it returns the value associated with that key using the loc accessor. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
