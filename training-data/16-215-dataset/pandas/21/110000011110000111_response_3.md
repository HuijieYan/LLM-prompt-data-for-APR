The bug in the provided function seems to occur when using a list as an indexer for a Series, which raises a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with using other types of indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

Potential error location:
The issue may be related to the handling of list indexers in the function, which does not match the behavior of other indexers.

Bug's cause:
The function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements using a list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers (np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series).
2. Ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expectations set by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Added handling for list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            pass

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, and it should pass the failing test case. Additionally, it should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
