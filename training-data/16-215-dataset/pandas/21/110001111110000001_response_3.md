The buggy function is `_get_with` and it seems to be causing issues when trying to index the Series object `ser` with the key `key`. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised, but the function is not raising it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks the type of `key` and attempts to handle different cases. The error message indicates that a KeyError is not being raised when it is expected to be.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the different types of keys that could be passed to the `_get_with` function, leading to the function not raising a KeyError when it should.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for how different types of keys are handled and ensure that a KeyError is raised in the appropriate cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a try-except block is used to attempt to access the key using `self.loc[key]` and if a KeyError is raised, it is re-raised with a custom message indicating that the key was not found in the index.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test as it correctly raises a KeyError when the expected key is not found in the index.
