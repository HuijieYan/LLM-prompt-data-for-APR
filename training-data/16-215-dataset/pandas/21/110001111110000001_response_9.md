The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be handling various cases for indexing a Series object. The failing test is trying to index a Series with a key that is not present in the index, and it expects a KeyError to be raised, which the current implementation is not doing.

The potential error location is likely in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block where it tries to access `self.loc[key]` without handling potential KeyError when the key is not present in the index.

The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the case where the key is not present in the index, which leads to the KeyError not being raised as expected in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the KeyError when the key is not present in the index. We can achieve this by using a try-except block to catch the KeyError and raise it when the key is not found in the index.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with` is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle the KeyError when the key is not found in the index, and it should pass the failing test.
