1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` within the `Series` class.
   - The function is designed to handle different types of indexers including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like indexers.
   - The failing test is checking for the behavior of the function when a list-like indexer doesn't match any values in the Series.
   - The error message indicates that the list-like indexer is not being handled correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The error is likely occurring in the part of the function that handles list-like indexers.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The `_get_with` function is not handling list-like indexers properly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
   (b). The related functions `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` seem unrelated to the issue.
   (c). The failing test checks for the behavior of the function when a list-like indexer doesn't match any values in the Series, and the error message indicates a `KeyError`.
   (d). The GitHub issue highlights that the function is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency.

4. Possible Approaches:
   - Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.
   - Ensure that list-like indexers return the expected behavior, similar to array-like indexers.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, pd.DataFrame)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
The corrected function handles list-like indexers using `loc` directly, similar to other array-like indexers. This ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
