The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional checks and the way it handles different types of keys. The function first checks if the key is a slice or a DataFrame, and then checks if it's a tuple. If the key is not any of these types, it assumes it's a scalar and tries to access it using the `loc` method. This assumption may not be correct and could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can reorganize the conditional checks to handle different types of keys more accurately and efficiently. We can also add error handling for unsupported key types.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if all(isinstance(k, (int, np.integer)) for k in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

In the corrected code:
- We first check if the key is a slice or a DataFrame and handle them accordingly.
- We then check if the key is a tuple and handle it using the `_get_values_tuple` function.
- Next, we check if the key is list-like and contains only integers, in which case we use `iloc` to access the values.
- If the key is a single integer, we also use `iloc` to access the value.
- If the key does not match any of these types, we raise a `KeyError` for unsupported key type.

These changes ensure that the function correctly handles different types of keys and provides more accurate behavior.
