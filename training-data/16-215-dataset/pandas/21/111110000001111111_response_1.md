The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers. The function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers, but there seems to be an issue with the handling of list indexers.

From the expected value and type of variables, it can be seen that the `key_type` is expected to be `'string'` when the input `key` is a list. However, the actual value of `key_type` is `'integer'`. This suggests that the function is not properly identifying the type of the `key` when it is a list.

The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in pandas. The issue mentions that when using `ser.loc[key]`, it raises an error for all cases. This inconsistency may be related to the bug in the `_get_with` function.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly identify the type of the `key` when it is a list and handle it consistently with the other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle scalar key
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code handles the list-like key separately and ensures that it is processed consistently with the other types of indexers. It also includes a check for empty list keys and raises a `KeyError` in that case. This should resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub issue.
