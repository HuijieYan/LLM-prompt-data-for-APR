The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different data types passed as the `key` parameter. It should identify the data type of the key and then perform the appropriate action based on the type. However, it currently has a bug that causes it to incorrectly identify the data type of the key, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing tests.

The bug is likely located in the portion of the function that determines the `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed. There could be an issue with the logic used to identify the `key_type`, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the `key_type` should be correctly identified based on the type of `key` being passed. Additionally, the appropriate action should be taken based on the identified `key_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif pd.api.types.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should now properly identify the `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed, and perform the appropriate action based on the identified `key_type`. It should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
