The issue in the given function is that it doesn't handle the case where `key` is a list-like object properly and it doesn't return the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
                key = list(key)
            
            if not isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
                key = pd.Series(key, index=self.index)  # Convert to Series with the original index
                
            return self.reindex(key)
```

I have added checks to ensure that if `key` is a list-like object, it is converted to a Pandas Series with the original index. This ensures that the reindexing operation works correctly.

This corrected version should now handle all the provided test cases properly.
