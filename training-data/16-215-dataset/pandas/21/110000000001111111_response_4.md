The issue seems to be related to the different behavior of the `ser[key]` indexing when `key` is a list, `pd.Series` or `np.array`. The GitHub issue also points out that there is inconsistency in the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` across these cases. This suggests that the bug is likely in how the function handles different types of indexers and possibly how it handles the conversion of the indexers. Since the expected behavior is consistent for all cases, the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the key_type and its conversion.

The function seems to incorrectly determine the `key_type` based on the `key`, and then further uses this type to decide whether to treat the key as positional or label-based. This determination of `key_type` seems to be incorrect as evidenced by the fact that it always returns `'string'` regardless of the input type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly determine the type of the `key` and decide whether to treat it as positional or label-based based on that type. It should also handle the case when the `key` is a list-like object properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle the case when the key is a list
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # determine the key_type based on the type of key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should now handle the different types of indexers correctly and provide consistent behavior for all input cases. It should also resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
