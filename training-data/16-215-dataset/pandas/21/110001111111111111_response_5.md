The bug in the function is that it treats list indexers differently than array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, it raises a KeyError, while it does not raise for other array-like indexers.

The `if not is_list_like(key):` block of code is causing the inconsistency in behavior. It specifically checks for `is_list_like`, which is likely treating list indexers differently than other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the code should treat list indexers the same way as it treats other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by removing the `if not is_list_like(key):` and the subsequent code block, and then directly proceeding to the implementation that handles the array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other array-like indexers. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and is likely to resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
