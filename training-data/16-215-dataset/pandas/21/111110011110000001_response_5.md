The problematic function is `_get_with` from the `Series` class, which is called by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from the test file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" suggests that the function is not handling the input correctly.

The `_get_with` function is responsible for returning a specific value from the Series. The error message indicates that when attempting to access the value "C", the function is not able to find it in the index of the Series.

The potential error location within the function is the section that handles non-list-like keys. It attempts to determine the `key_type` and then based on that, it tries to get the values from the Series. However, it is not effectively handling certain types of keys, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, handling of non-list-like keys needs to be reassessed, and the logic for handling different key types needs to be improved. This will ensure that all types of keys are properly processed, and the value can be retrieved from the Series without causing a KeyError.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    return self.loc[key]
```

This revised version of the function explicitly checks for specific key types (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple) and then defaults to using `self.loc` for single keys or lists of keys. This should address the KeyError issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
