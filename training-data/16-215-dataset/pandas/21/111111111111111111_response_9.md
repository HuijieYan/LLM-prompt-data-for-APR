The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers with the Series object. The failing test is expecting the same behavior when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as an indexer for the Series object. However, the actual behavior is inconsistent, with the list case raising a KeyError while the other cases do not.

The problematic function is `_get_with(self, key)`. The bug is likely caused by the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, you can modify the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should fix the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # All other cases can be treated as list-like
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers and should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values.

The corrected code should also address the issue posted in the GitHub bug, providing consistent behavior when using different indexers with the Series object.
