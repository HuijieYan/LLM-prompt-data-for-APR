The issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled. The GitHub issue title suggests that the problem might be related to how Series are indexed with no matches. The issue description also notes that list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be related to how the function handles the different types of indexers. The function checks for the type of the key and then performs different operations based on the type. However, it seems that the handling of list indexers may be causing the inconsistency.

The actual value for key_type is always 'string', which seems to suggest that the function is always taking the same path regardless of the type of the key.

Based on this information, it seems that the bug is caused by the function not correctly differentiating between the different types of indexers, especially when handling list indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of the indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrections, the function should now consistently handle the different types of indexers and provide the expected behavior for the different input cases.

This code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and provide consistent behavior for indexing Series with different types of indexers.
