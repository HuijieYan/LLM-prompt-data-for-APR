The bug is located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling the case where a list-like index key is passed in, resulting in inconsistent behavior with other types of indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is attempting to retrieve values from a `Series` using a key that does not exist in the index. It expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but the function is not raising the error as expected when a list-like indexer is used.

The function does not handle the case where a list-like indexer is passed in, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is the source of the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like index keys similarly to other types of indexers. It should raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now properly handle list-like index keys and raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
