The bug in the '_get_with' function is causing inconsistency when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The failing test 'test_getitem_no_matches' is specifically testing the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, such as list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The error message indicates that for the list indexer, the function is raising a KeyError, while for the other types of indexers it is not.

The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency and questions the compelling reason for treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers when indexing a Series.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle all types of indexers consistently and not raise a KeyError for the list indexer. The correct behavior should be consistent with array-like indexers and should not raise an error for the list indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the '_get_with' function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test. Additionally, it will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository by ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
