The buggy function is `_get_with` which is a method of the `Series` class. The function is used to get values from the `Series` object based on the given key. The failing test cases are testing the behavior of the function when a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series is passed as the key.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when a list is passed as the key properly, leading to a KeyError. The function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which causes inconsistency in behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the list indexer case in the same way as other array-like indexers, thus ensuring consistent behavior. The correction should address the inconsistency and make sure that the behavior is aligned with the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code handles the list indexer case properly by using `self.loc[key]` which allows for consistent behavior with other array-like indexers. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
