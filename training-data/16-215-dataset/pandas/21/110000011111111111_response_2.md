The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when the key is a list. The failing test is attempting to index a Series with a list key, and the function is not handling this case correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The problem lies in the initial check for the type of the key. When the key is a list, the function attempts to proceed with the `loc` method, but this does not work as expected.

The expected behavior is to handle a list key in a similar manner to other array-like indexers, such as arrays and Index objects, and return NaN for missing values.

To fix the bug, the function should check for a list-like key and handle it in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers. It should also handle the case where the key is not found in the index without raising a KeyError.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, and pass the failing test. This should also address the issue raised in the GitHub post.
