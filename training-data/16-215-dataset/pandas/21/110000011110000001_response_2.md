The buggy function is a method to handle getting values from a Series object. It has multiple conditions to check the type of the key and return values accordingly. The failing test is trying to test the behavior when the key is not found in the Series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the `elif not is_list_like(key)` condition since it directly accesses the `loc` attribute without performing any checks or conversions of the key.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case when the key is not found in the Series properly. It directly tries to access the key without any checks, leading to a KeyError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to implement proper error handling when the key is not found in the Series or perform proper checks before accessing the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle the case when key is not found
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code implements proper error handling when the key is not found in the Series, and also applies checks before accessing the key. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test.
