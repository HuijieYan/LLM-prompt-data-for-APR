The buggy function is intended to handle different types of input `key` and return the appropriate slice of the series data. However, the issue seems to arise from the mismanagement of input data types in some cases.

The failing tests are all reporting that no KeyError is raised when it should be. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the input `key` and failing to return the expected slice of the series.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conditional statements used to handle different types of `key`. It seems that for some input types, the function is not correctly identifying the type of key and fails to return the appropriate slice.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of input `key` and returns the appropriate slice based on its type. This can be achieved by revising the conditional statements and the logic used to handle different input types.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle different input types for `key` and raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.
