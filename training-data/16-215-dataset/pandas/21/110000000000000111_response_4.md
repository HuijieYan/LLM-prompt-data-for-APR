1. The buggy function is an indexing function for a Series object in pandas. The GitHub issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles list indexers and array-like indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles different types of indexers, specifically the part where it checks if the key is a list.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The GitHub issue highlights how the function behaves differently when dealing with list indexers, leading to inconsistent results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Standardizing the behavior for all types of indexers, whether it's a list, array, or other array-like objects.
   - Ensuring that the function treats all indexers consistently and handles them in a uniform manner.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexing consistently
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected code standardizes the behavior for all types of indexers and should address the issue raised in the GitHub post by handling list indexing consistently.
