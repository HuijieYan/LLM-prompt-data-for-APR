The problem lies in the part of the code that handles list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The failing test is demonstrating that `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError, while `ser[pd.Index(key)]` and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not. 

The issue described in the GitHub post points to the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, with `ser.loc[key]` raising for all cases. The user has attempted to make all cases behave like the list case, with only one test breaking.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ABCDataFrame)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency in behavior described in the GitHub issue.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and also address the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
