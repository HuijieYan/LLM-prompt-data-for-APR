The buggy function is the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. This function is designed to retrieve values from the `Series` using different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists.

The failing test is trying to retrieve a value from the `Series` using a key in a `box` (list, ndarray, Index, or Series). The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when trying to retrieve a value using the provided key.

The potential error in the `_get_with` function could be related to how it handles different types of keys, especially when checking the type of the key and deciding how to retrieve the values from the `Series`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the different types of keys more robustly, ensuring that the appropriate method of retrieval is used for each type of key. Additionally, it should be able to handle and raise a `KeyError` if the key does not exist in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function takes into account the type of key being used and appropriately handles it. Additionally, if the key does not exist in the index, it raises a `KeyError` as expected. This should ensure that the failing test is passed.
