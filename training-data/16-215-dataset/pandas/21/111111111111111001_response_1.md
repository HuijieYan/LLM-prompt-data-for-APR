The issue in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the case where the key is an array-like object, such as a list, numpy array, index, or series. As a result, the function tries to access elements of the series with an object that is not compatible with the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle array-like keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = np.asarray(key) if not is_list_like(key) else key

        if not isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, pd.Series)):
            key = pd.Series(key)

        if key.dtype == 'object':
            key = pd.Index(key)

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected implementation will handle array-like keys and convert them to a Pandas Series or Index before performing the `reindex` operation. This should ensure that the function works correctly for different types of keys and passes the failing test cases.
