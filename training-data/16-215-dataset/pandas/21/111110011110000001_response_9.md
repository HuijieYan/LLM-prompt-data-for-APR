The buggy function is trying to return a value based on the provided key, which could be of several types such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, Series, or Index. However, the current implementation is not properly handling the key types, which is causing the KeyError in the failing test.

The bug within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of different key types. It seems that the function is trying to handle various key types, but the implementation is not handling them correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The problematic function and the failing test indicate that the key types are not being handled properly in the function, leading to an uncaught KeyError in the failing test.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the function handles different key types appropriately. This may involve re-evaluating the conditional statements and logic for different key types, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, ndarrays, Series, and Index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test by handling different key types appropriately and preventing the KeyError from occurring.
