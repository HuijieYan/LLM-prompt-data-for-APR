The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers for a pandas Series. The GitHub issue indicates that using `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError, while `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not. The expected behavior is for all these cases to behave like `ser[list(key)]`. 

The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle all types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner. This means ensuring that all cases, including list, np.ndarray, and Index, are handled properly to avoid errors and inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is as expected and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
