The bug in the function lies in the logic for handling different types of key inputs. When the key is in the form of a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or a scalar, the function should return the corresponding elements from the Series. However, the current implementation is not handling all these cases correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

The function is not differentiating between different types of key inputs properly. It assumes that when the key is not list-like, it should be treated as a label-based index. This is incorrect, and the logic for handling different types of key inputs needs to be reevaluated.

In addition, the function is not handling the case where the key is not found in the index correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Check if the key is a scalar or scalar-like and return the corresponding element from the Series directly.
2. Handle the case where the key is not found in the index to avoid the KeyError.
3. Differentiate between different types of key inputs and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if np.isscalar(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"The key {key} was not found in the index.")
```

With the corrected code, the function will properly handle different types of key inputs and avoid the KeyError. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
