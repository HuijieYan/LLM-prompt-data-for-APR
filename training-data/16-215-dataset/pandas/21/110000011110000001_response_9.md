The buggy function appears to be an indexing function for a pandas Series or DataFrame. The failing test is checking for the correct behavior when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index or column. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a KeyError when it was expected to.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it handles non-existent keys or index locations. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case when the key does not exist in the index.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the case when the key does not exist in the index. It is failing to raise a KeyError as expected in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly raise a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index. This can be done by adding a check for the key's existence in the index and raising a KeyError if it does not exist.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check if key is present in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function will now raise a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index, satisfying the failing test.
