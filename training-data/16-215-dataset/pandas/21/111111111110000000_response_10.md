The issue with the function is that it's not handling the input types correctly. It assumes that the key type is a list, numpy array, Index, Series or ExtensionArray, but it fails to handle other types such as a DataFrame.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this change, the function should handle different input types correctly and the failing tests should pass.
