The issue with the current implementation of the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle the case where the key doesn't exist in the index properly. It should raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index, but it is attempting multiple different checks and conversions before reaching that point. 

Here's the corrected and simplified version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This improved version first checks if the key is in the index using `key in self.index`, and if it is, it returns the result of `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not in the index, it raises a `KeyError` with an informative message.

This corrected version should satisfy all the failing test cases.
