The problem lies in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling list indexers correctly and is raising a KeyError when a list indexer is used. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled, such as array-like indexers.

The issue is identified in the failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`, where a KeyError is raised when using a list indexer.

The corresponding GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" explains that there is inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, and provides an example where using list indexer specifically raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers. This will involve updating the logic for list indexers to avoid the KeyError that is currently being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `KeyError` issue should be resolved and the function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This should also satisfy the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
