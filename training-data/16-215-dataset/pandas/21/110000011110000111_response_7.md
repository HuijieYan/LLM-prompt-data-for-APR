Analysis:
The buggy function is a method for indexing a Series object. The failing test is intended to test the behavior of the function when indexing with different types of objects (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series). The error message indicates that the function did not raise a KeyError as expected.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers. It points out that the behavior for list indexers is different from array-like indexers, and also mentions that ser.loc[key] raises for all cases.

Potential error location:
The potential error location within the function could be the block of code that handles the list-like key.

Bug's cause:
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent behavior of the function when using different types of indexers. The function may not be handling list-like keys correctly, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Standardize the behavior for different types of indexers to ensure consistency.
2. Ensure that the function handles list-like keys in the same way as array-like indexers.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle different types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test, while also resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
