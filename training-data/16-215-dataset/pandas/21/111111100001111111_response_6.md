The issue arises from inconsistency in the behavior of the Series object when indexed with a list. The existing code doesn't handle the list indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError. The problem seems to be with the type-checking and handling of different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Series object is handled consistently when indexed with different types of objects (list, array, index). Additionally, the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` should also be taken into account.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to update the `_get_with` function to handle the different types of indexers properly. We also need to ensure that proper error handling and fallback mechanisms are in place to provide consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        if all(x in self.index for x in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code ensures that the function handles different types of indexers consistently and provides proper error handling. It also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread by providing the expected behavior for indexing with a list.
