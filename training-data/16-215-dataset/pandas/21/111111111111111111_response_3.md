The issue in the provided code is due to how list indexers are being treated differently from other types of indexers, such as array-like or Index indexers.

The failing test is attempting to index a Series using a list indexer, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. However, the test does not raise the expected KeyError, indicating that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

The source of the issue is within the `_get_with` function, specifically in the section where it handles the different types of indexers. The logic for handling list indexers is causing the discrepancy in behavior.

To fix the issue, the `_get_with` function needs to treat list indexers the same way as other types of indexers in order to maintain consistent behavior for all indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Treat list indexers the same as other types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = np.asarray(key)

    if key.dtype == object:
        key_type = 'string'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers, and it should pass the failing tests. Additionally, this fix should address the issue posted in the GitHub report.
