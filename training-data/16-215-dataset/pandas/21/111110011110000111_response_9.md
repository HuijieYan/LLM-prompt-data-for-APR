The bug is located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The failing test is trying to index a Series with a list, array, Index, and Series. The error message indicates that the list indexing is inconsistent with the other indexers and raises a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers properly and is inconsistent with how it handles other types of indexers. This inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all 4 cases, indicating that the behavior is not consistent across different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the code in the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, making the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
