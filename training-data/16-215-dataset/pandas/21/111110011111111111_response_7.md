The issue is caused by the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing unexpected behavior and inconsistent error messages.

The failing test is testing the case where a list indexer is used, and the error message indicates that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers. This will make the behavior consistent and ensure that the function passes the failing test.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed-integer"):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by making the behavior consistent for all types of indexers.
