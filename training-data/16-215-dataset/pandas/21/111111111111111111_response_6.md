The issue here arises from the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` method of the Series class. It seems that list indexers are being treated differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` method. The method is not correctly identifying the type of indexers and handling them accordingly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` method needs to be modified to correctly handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` method should now correctly handle list indexers and other types of indexers in a consistent manner. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the method passes the failing test and behaves as expected in all cases.
