The problem in the buggy function seems to be related to how different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index) are handled. It appears that when the indexer is a list, it is not being handled properly, resulting in a KeyError.

The function appears to be designed to handle different types of indexers and behave accordingly, but it seems to be failing to do so for the list case.

Based on the GitHub issue description, there seems to be inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to unexpected behaviors.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner along with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "mixed-integer":  # New type for mixed int and string
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle list indexers in a consistent manner along with other types of indexers, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post. The code also caters to a new type of key_type, "mixed-integer", for handling mixed integer and string indexers.
