The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in how the different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. The function does not treat list indexers the same as array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior.

The key issue is related to the handling of list indexers within the function `_get_with`. When the key is of type list, the function does not handle it properly, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is the improper handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function, causing the function to behave inconsistently with different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. This will involve adding conditional statements to properly handle list indexers, similar to how other types of indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):  # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):  # Handle Index objects
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    else:  # Handles cases for np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function now ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
