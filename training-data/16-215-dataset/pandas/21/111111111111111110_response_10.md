The issue with the current implementation of the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior. To fix this, we can modify the function to treat all indexers in a consistent manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        if self.index.is_type_compatible(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

```

This corrected version should treat all types of indexers consistently, resolving the issues with inconsistent behavior. It should also ensure that the failing tests for the `_get_with` function pass successfully.

In addition, a GitHub issue can be opened with the title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" to document this bug and its fix, along with a detailed description of the issue and the proposed solution. This will help to track the issue and its resolution within the project's development process.
