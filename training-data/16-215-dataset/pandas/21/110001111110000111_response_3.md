The issue lies in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function is not handling the different types of indexers (list, array, Index, Series) consistently, which is causing the failing test and the error message.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access non-existing values in the series using different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series). The test expects the same behavior for all types of indexers, but the `_get_with` function is treating them differently, leading to inconsistency and the KeyError.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is an inconsistency in the behavior of the function when it comes to handling different types of indexers. The issue highlights that the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, and this behavior is not consistent with how `ser.loc[key]` behaves.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle all types of indexers (list, array, Index, Series) consistently. It should treat them in a similar manner and provide the expected behavior for accessing non-existing values in the series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

This corrected code treats all types of indexers consistently, returning the expected behavior when accessing non-existing values in the series. This fix should address the failing test and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
