1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate action based on the key type. It calls other related functions like `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` to handle specific types of keys.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional branches where it checks the type of the key and determines the action to be taken.

3. The bug's cause is most likely due to incorrect handling of key types and the corresponding actions. Specifically, the conditional branches may not be covering all possible key types, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Review the conditional branches and ensure they cover all possible key types and handle them appropriately.
   b. Use isinstance checks to accurately determine the type of key being passed.
   c. Use proper error handling for unexpected key types.
   d. Ensure that the function calls related functions with the correct parameters and handles their return values appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.api.extensions.ExtensionArray, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```
This corrected code includes appropriate checks for different key types and handles them accordingly. It also includes an error handling case for unsupported key types.
