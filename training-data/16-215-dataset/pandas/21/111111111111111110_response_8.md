The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list-like indexers correctly. It is treating them differently from other array-like indexers, which is causing inconsistency in behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistency in behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["string", "integer"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the `_get_with` function will now handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior for different types of indexers.

This fix addresses the inconsistency observed in the failing tests and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
