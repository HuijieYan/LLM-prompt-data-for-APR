The issue is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexers do not match any items in the Series. The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" suggests that the behavior differs when using different types of indexers.

The problem in the function seems to be in the section where it checks the type of the key and how it handles the different cases. The function does not handle the case of list indexers correctly when they do not match any items in the Series.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicates that the function is not handling the case of list indexers that do not match any items in the Series correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case of list indexers that do not match any items in the Series the same way as it handles other types of indexers. This will ensure consistency in behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the case of list indexers that do not match any items in the Series the same way as it handles other types of indexers, fixing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
