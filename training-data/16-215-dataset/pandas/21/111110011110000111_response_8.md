The problematic function is the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. The error is likely occurring within the section of the code where a list-like key is being processed.

The failing test is expecting the behavior to be consistent for different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series), but the function is not behaving consistently and is raising a KeyError for the list key.

The problem seems to be related to the way list key indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The issue raised in the GitHub description is also related to this inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, producing the expected behavior for each type. This will involve modifying the code to handle list key indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, ValueError):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            raise
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, we handle all types of indexers (including list-like) using the `loc` method and handle any potential KeyError or ValueError by falling back to reindexing.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub description.
