1. The buggy function is called `_get_with` and it is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. This function is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values from the `Series`. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when a list-like indexer is passed.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the section that deals with a list-like indexer. It seems that the current implementation of handling list-like indexers is causing a `KeyError` to be raised, which is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled.

3. The bug is caused because the `_get_with` function is not handling list-like indexers correctly. When a list-like indexer is passed to the function, it is not able to retrieve the corresponding values from the `Series`, and instead raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled, and it is also causing the failing test to fail with a `KeyError` message.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function and ensuring that it aligns with the behavior for other indexers.
   - Updating the logic to properly handle list-like indexers and retrieve the corresponding values from the `Series`.
   - Making sure that the function does not raise a `KeyError` when a list-like indexer is passed, and instead returns the expected values from the `Series`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring that the function does not raise a `KeyError` when a list-like indexer is passed. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
