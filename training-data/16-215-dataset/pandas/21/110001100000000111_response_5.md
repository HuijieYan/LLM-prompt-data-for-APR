1. The buggy function '_get_with' is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slice, tuple, etc. It also deals with different types of keys, such as list, array, or scalar values. The related functions, such as '_slice', '_get_values_tuple', and 'reindex' are called within the 'get_with' function based on the type of key.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue mentions that 'ser.loc[key]' raises an error for all cases, indicating that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles the 'list' type of key. The function attempts to handle the 'list' type differently than other types, which may be causing the inconsistency in behavior.

3. The cause of the bug:
   (a). The buggy function '_get_with' handles list indexers differently than array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency in behavior.
   (b). The related functions are called based on the type of key, but the handling of lists may not be consistent with other types of indexers.
   (c). The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, and points out that 'ser.loc[key]' raises an error for all cases, indicating a discrepancy in handling list indexers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the handling of the 'list' type in the '_get_with' function to align it with the handling of array-like indexers.
   - Ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers when passed to 'ser.loc[key]'.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of list key type has been updated to ensure consistency with other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency in behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue.
