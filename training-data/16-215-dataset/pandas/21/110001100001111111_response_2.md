The bug in the provided function seems to stem from the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior is inconsistent when using a list indexer compared to array-like indexers, especially when used with the `.loc` attribute. Additionally, the issue mentions that all cases should behave like the list case, except for one specific test.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the handling of `key_type == "integer"` and the subsequent decision on whether to treat the indexer as a positional indexer or label-based indexer.

To fix the bug, we should aim to make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This would involve modifying the conditional statements and the handling of different types of indexers to ensure uniform behavior.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code ensures that all types of indexers are handled uniformly, and the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. Furthermore, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report regarding the inconsistent behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
