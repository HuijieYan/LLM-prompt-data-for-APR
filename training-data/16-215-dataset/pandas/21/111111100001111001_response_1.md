The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `key` input. It seems that the function is not properly identifying the type of the `key` parameter, which leads to the incorrect determination of `key_type`. As a result, the function is not returning the expected output for different types of input.

To fix this bug, the function should properly identify the type of the `key` parameter and determine the `key_type` based on its type. Additionally, the function should handle different types of input `key` correctly to ensure that the expected output is returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Use loc to handle all other cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of input `key` and return the expected output for all the provided test cases.
