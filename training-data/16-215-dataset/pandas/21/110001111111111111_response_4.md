The issue seems to be with the handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.) in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. 

The failing tests indicate that when using a list as an indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` while other types of indexers do not. This is inconsistent behavior. The failing test description also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases.

The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" indicates that there is inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in a similar manner as other types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior across all cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Handle all other cases with loc
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will use `self.loc[key]` for all indexer types, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This correction should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Furthermore, it resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
