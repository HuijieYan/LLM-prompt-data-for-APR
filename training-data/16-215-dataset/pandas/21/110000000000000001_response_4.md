1. The buggy function takes a key as input and returns the appropriate value based on the type of the key.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling the different types of keys, especially when determining the key type and deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle all possible types of keys correctly, leading to potential errors when trying to access the data.

4. To fix the bug, the function should have comprehensive logic to handle all types of keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, single values, lists, and numpy arrays, and apply the appropriate indexing method based on the type of the key.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected code, the function now properly handles different types of keys and applies the appropriate indexing method based on the key type. Additionally, it checks for the type of the key before determining the key type to avoid potential errors.
