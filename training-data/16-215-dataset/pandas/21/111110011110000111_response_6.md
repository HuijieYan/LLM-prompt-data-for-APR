1. The buggy function "_get_with" is part of the "Series" class in the pandas library. It is used to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series. The failing test "test_getitem_no_matches" is testing the behavior of the function when a key that does not exist in the index is passed.

2. The potential error location within the function seems to be in the handling of list-like indexers, which leads to a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index.

3. The buggy function is not handling list-like indexers properly, leading to a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers, like array-like indexers. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised when a key that does not exist in the index is passed, but the function is not behaving as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic for handling list-like indexers to match the behavior of other indexers.
   - Ensure that the function raises a KeyError when a key that does not exist in the index is passed.
   - Update the function to handle list-like indexers consistently with the behavior of other indexers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected code ensures that when a key that does not exist in the index is passed, a KeyError is raised consistently for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. This approach aligns with the behavior expected by the failing test and also resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
