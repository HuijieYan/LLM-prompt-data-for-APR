The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of input `key` and perform operations accordingly. The failing test is trying to use the `ser[key]` notation and expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but it is not being raised, leading to test failure.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional branches handling different types of `key`. It seems that the function is not handling the input `key` correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the input `key` in the function `_get_with`. It may not be properly distinguishing between different types of keys and is not raising the `KeyError` as expected.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the conditional branches and ensure that the function correctly handles different types of input `key` and raises the `KeyError` when appropriate.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handling list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError
```

By adding the `else` condition to raise a `KeyError` when the type of `key` is not handled, the function will now raise the expected error for unhandled types of `key`. This should make the failing test pass.
