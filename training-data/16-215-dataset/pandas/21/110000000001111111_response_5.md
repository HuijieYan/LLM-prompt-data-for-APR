The issue stems from the `_get_with` function's inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically with lists. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency, where the behavior of `ser[list(key)]` differs from other types of indexers, causing an unexpected KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of key when it is a list. It currently does not handle it consistently with other types of indexers, leading to the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The bug is caused by the function not treating list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve updating the conditional statements and the logic for handling different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, taking into account the expected input/output variable information and addressing the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
