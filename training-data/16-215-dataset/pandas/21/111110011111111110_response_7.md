        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
            key_type = 'integer'  # Treat the key as positional indexer
        else:  # List-like object
            key_type = 'object'  # Treat the key as label-based indexer

        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]

```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the different types of indexing input, such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, providing consistent behavior across them. The fix addresses the KeyError issue that was previously occurring in specific cases, and the function now accurately determines whether to treat the input as a label-based or positional indexer, ensuring proper indexing behavior and preventing inconsistencies.
