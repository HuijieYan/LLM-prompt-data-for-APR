The bug in the function is likely due to mismanagement of the different types of indexers. The function is treating array-like indexers differently from list indexers, which causes inconsistency in behavior. This is also highlighted in the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that using the `list(key)` indexer raises an error, while other indexers do not.

The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statement for handling list indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is the same regardless of the type of indexer used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle different types of indexers in a consistent manner
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, and the issue raised in the GitHub report should be resolved.
