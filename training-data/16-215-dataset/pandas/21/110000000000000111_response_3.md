1. The buggy function seems to be related to the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue seems to be about the inconsistent behavior of the function when using different types of indexers on a Series, especially when the indexers do not have any matches in the Series.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the if-else condition blocks where different types of indexers are checked. It seems that the function is not handling the cases of different indexers consistently, leading to the reported inconsistency in behavior.

3. (a). The buggy function seems to be inspecting the type of indexer and returning different results based on the type. It seems that the function may not be handling the different types of indexers consistently, leading to the reported issue.

   (b). The GitHub issue points out that when using different types of indexers on a Series, the behavior is inconsistent, especially when the indexers do not have any matches in the Series. This inconsistency is causing some indexers to raise errors, while others do not.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the different types of indexers consistently, especially when there are no matches in the Series. Additionally, the function should be updated to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should handle the different types of indexers consistently and align with the expected behavior as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
