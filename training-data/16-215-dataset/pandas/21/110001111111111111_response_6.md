The issue in the buggy function is with the handling of list indexers. When the indexer is a list, it raises a KeyError if the values are not present in the index, while the behavior for other indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series is to return NaN for missing values. This inconsistency in behavior is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that when the indexer is a list, it will return NaN for missing values instead of raising a KeyError, aligning its behavior with other indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and it should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
