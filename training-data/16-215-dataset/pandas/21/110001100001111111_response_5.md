The issue is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of `key` being a list properly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the `key` variable when it is a list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when `key` is a list, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to properly handle the case when `key` is a list. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code will properly handle the case when `key` is a list, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
