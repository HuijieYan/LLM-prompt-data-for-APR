The issue is likely located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function contains multiple conditional statements to handle different types of input keys. It seems that the handling of `list` input keys differs from the handling of other types of input keys, resulting in the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing test.

The failing tests indicate that the function is expected to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a list, but the function does not raise the expected error when a list is used.

The GitHub issue further confirms the inconsistency in behavior, especially when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for different types of input keys. In particular, the handling of `list` input keys needs to be adjusted to match the behavior of other input types, such as arrays or indices.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should provide consistent behavior for different types of input keys, and it should pass the failing tests.

This fix ensures that the `_get_with` function treats list input keys in the same way as other types of input keys, addressing the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing tests and reported in the GitHub issue.
