The buggy function is `_get_with` in the `Series` class. The function is intended to handle various types of indexers and return the corresponding values. However, the function has a bug that causes it to behave differently for list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of indexers and expects consistent behavior across all of them. The test fails when using a list indexer, as it does not raise the expected `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. It incorrectly treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that list indexers are treated in the same way as array-like indexers.
2. Update the code to ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` for all types of indexers when there are no matches in the index.
3. Consider refactoring the logic to make the handling of different types of indexers more uniform and predictable.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        # Handle the case when none of the keys are present in the index
        if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code ensures that the function handles all types of indexers consistently and raises a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index. This approach resolves the inconsistency observed in the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, this fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread, ensuring uniform behavior for all types of indexers.
