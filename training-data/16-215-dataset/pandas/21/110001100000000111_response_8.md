1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of indexers such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, and others for a Series object.
   - The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and KeyErrors.

2. Potential error location:
   - The error may be in the logic that handles list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing the inconsistency and KeyErrors.

3. Bug's cause:
   - (a). The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.
   - (b). Related functions such as `loc` and `reindex` are also affected by the inconsistent handling of list indexers, leading to KeyErrors as reported in the GitHub issue.
   - (c). The GitHub issue reports that treating list indexers differently leads to inconsistency and unexpected behavior when accessing Series elements.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.
   - Update the related functions (`loc`, `reindex`) to ensure they handle list indexers consistently.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently, addressing the inconsistency and unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
