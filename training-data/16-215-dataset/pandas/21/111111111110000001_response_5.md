The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of input keys, including handling slices and reindexing. The failing test is testing the behaviour of the function when called with a key that is not in the index of the series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that checks if the key is an instance of a list or similar types. This section also contains a call to `reindex` which may be causing the KeyError raised in the failing test.

The bug's cause:
(a). The problematic function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is not present in the index correctly.
(b). The related class `Series` has methods such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` that are called from the problematic function.
(c). The failing test is calling the problematic function with a key that is not present in the index and expecting a KeyError to be raised, which is not happening.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the section of the code that checks if the key is an instance of a list or similar types to handle the case where the key is not present in the index correctly. 
2. Investigate the use of `reindex` within the problematic function and ensure it is being used correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Handle the case where the key is not present in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
        
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code handles the case where the key is not present in the index correctly by raising a KeyError with a message indicating that the key is not in the index. It also removes the use of `reindex` and directly returns the value using `self.loc[key]`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test by properly handling the case where the key is not present in the index and raising a KeyError.
