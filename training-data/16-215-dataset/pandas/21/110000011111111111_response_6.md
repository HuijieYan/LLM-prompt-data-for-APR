Potential issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically the `list` type. The test cases are failing because the function is not handling the `list` type indexers as expected, resulting in a `KeyError`.

Bug cause:
The function is not properly handling the `list` type indexers, leading to the `KeyError` when accessing the series with a `list` indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other indexers such as arrays or indices.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The function needs to handle the `list` type indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers such as arrays or indices.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for non-list indexers
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for list indexers
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)  # Fallback to reindex if key is not found
```

With the corrected code, the function properly handles `list` type indexers by trying to access the Series using `loc` and falling back to reindexing if the key is not found.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This will also address the issue posted in the GitHub bug report, ensuring consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
