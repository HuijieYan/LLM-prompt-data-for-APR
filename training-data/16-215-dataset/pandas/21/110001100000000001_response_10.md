1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a `key` as input and checks its type to determine how to handle the input. It calls other related functions such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex` based on the type of `key`. The potential error location is within the logic that checks the type of `key` and determines the appropriate action for each type.

2. The potential error is in the `if` statement that checks the type of the `key` and determines the appropriate action based on its type.

3. The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly handles the different types of `key` and does not return the correct result for each type. For example, it incorrectly checks for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` which may not be the correct check for a DataFrame.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correctly identifying the type of `key` and handling each type appropriately.
   - Using the correct methods to handle slicing, tuple, and other types of `key`.
   - Ensuring that the function calls the related functions with the correct parameters.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key_type = np.inferred_type(key)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
