1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class, and it is used for indexing and retrieving values from the series. The function checks the type of the input `key` and then performs different operations based on the type.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block, where it tries to handle scalar values. The code in this block may not handle all scalar cases correctly.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the scalar handling logic may not cover all cases of scalar values properly, leading to unexpected behavior when a scalar value is used as the key for indexing.

4. To fix the bug, we can review and improve the logic for handling scalar values, ensuring that all different types of scalar values are handled correctly. We also need to ensure that the function returns the expected result for each input type.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added a condition to handle scalar values of type `str` or `bytes` separately. These types of scalar values will be used with `loc` directly.
- We have simplified the handling of list-like and array-like inputs, ensuring that they all use the `loc` method for indexing.
- The code is now more explicit in how it handles different types of input keys, making the behavior more predictable and consistent.
