The issue stems from the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently from other types of indexers. When a list indexer is used, the function tries to find the index values in the series. However, if the key is not found in the index, it should raise a KeyError instead of trying to reindex. This discrepancy causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. The function should check if the key is in the index, and if not, raise a KeyError. This will align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers and resolve the inconsistency.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This correction ensures that the function behaves consistently for list indexers and other types of indexers, and it aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided. It also addresses the issue posted in the GitHub report by handling list indexers in a manner consistent with other indexers.
