The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the determination of the type of key and handling the different types of keys. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised when trying to access a key that is not present in the index.

The buggy function is not handling some of the key types properly, resulting in a KeyError not being raised as expected in the failing test. It also seems that the function does not properly categorize the type of keys and determine how to handle them.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of keys and ensure that a KeyError is raised when the key is not present in the index. Additionally, we should ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected code, the buggy function should now handle different key types properly and raise a KeyError when the key is not present in the index. This should make it pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
