The issue here is that when the input parameter `key` is a list, the function is not handling it properly and is throwing an error. The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" suggests that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers.

Based on the input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to the KeyError when trying to access `ser[list(key)]`.

The potential error location is in the section of the code where it checks the type of the `key` input parameter and tries to handle it based on its type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when the `key` input parameter is a list correctly. It should be treated similarly to other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function handles both list and array-like indexers by using `loc` for both cases, which is consistent with the behavior for other types of indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and also satisfy all the expected input/output variable information.
