The potential error location within the buggy function appears to be the handling of list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This is leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing the Series using different types of indexers.

The buggy function `_get_with` seems to have an issue with how it handles different types of indexers (`key`). It seems to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior.

The failing test is trying to access the Series using a list indexer, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. However, the function is not raising the KeyError as expected, indicating a discrepancy in behavior.

The GitHub issue further explains the inconsistency in behavior and questions whether there is a compelling reason for it. It implies that the behavior of list indexers should be aligned with the behavior of other types of indexers for consistency.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is uniform across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function should handle different types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test. Additionally, the corrected behavior should align with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
