1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class and is responsible for handling various types of index inputs and returning the corresponding values from the series. The failing test is intended to check for the behavior when an index key does not match any values in the series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the section where it handles the case when `key` is not found in the series and should raise a `KeyError`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` function is not correctly handling the case when the provided `key` is not found in the series, and it should raise a `KeyError` based on the failing test and the error message.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the `key` is not found in the series and raise a `KeyError` accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [{self.index}]")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the case when the key is not found in the series is explicitly handled for list inputs. If the length of the key is 0, it will raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message. This will ensure that the failing test is passed and the function behaves as expected.
