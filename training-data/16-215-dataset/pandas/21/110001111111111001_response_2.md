The issue in the `_get_with` function seems to be with how it handles different types of input for the `key` parameter. In the failing test cases, the error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised when it should be.

The bug appears to be in the handling of non-existent keys, and the function seems to have a complex logic to determine the type and category of the `key` before handling it.

To fix the bug, we need to simplify the logic for handling different key types and ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when the key does not exist in the index.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for handling different key types and directly use the index to check for the existence of the key. If the key does not exist, raise a `KeyError`. Additionally, we can use the `if-elif-else` structure to handle the different scenarios based on the type of key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function considering the given failing test cases:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle different key types and correctly raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
