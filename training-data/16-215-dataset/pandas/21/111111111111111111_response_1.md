The problem is occurring in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling the case where key is a list-like object properly. This is leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing the Series using different types of indexers.

The error message indicates that for a list-like key, the function is raising a KeyError, stating that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with other types of indexers.

To fix the issue, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the case of a list-like key in the same way as it handles other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case where key is a list-like object
    key = list(key)
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this change, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like objects in the same way as other types of indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior when accessing the Series using different types of indexers.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
