The buggy function in the Series class is `_get_with`, which is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slice, DataFrames, and tuples.

The error occurs when using `ser[list(key)]` to access elements in the Series. This results in a KeyError, while using other types of indexers like np.array or pd.Index, does not.

The failing test is checking for this specific behavior and expects a KeyError to be raised. The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

To address this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers. This ensures consistency and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case for list indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected code, the `ser[list(key)]` indexing will behave consistently and match the behavior of other types of indexers. This change will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
