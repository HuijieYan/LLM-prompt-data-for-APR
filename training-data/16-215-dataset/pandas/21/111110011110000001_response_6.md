1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class and is related to the failing test code `test_getitem_no_matches` from the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

2. The potential error location within the function is the `if not is_list_like(key):` condition followed by the `return self.loc[key]` statement.

3. (a) The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding values based on the type. However, it seems that for certain input types, it is not behaving as expected, resulting in the test failure.

   (b) The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function, and based on the behavior observed, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of different key types.

   (c) The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` to be raised when using certain input types, but the function is not raising it as expected, leading to the test failure.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for different input types.
   - Verify the handling of different key types and ensure that the appropriate actions are taken for each type.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check for other types of key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)) or lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False) in ['integer', 'mixed-integer', 'floating']:
        loc = self.loc[key]
        if len(loc) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return loc

    # Default behavior
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to handle keys that are not list-like or are of specific string or bytes types. It also handles specific types such as numpy arrays, Series, or Index, and raises a `KeyError` if none of the values in the key are found in the index. This should address the issue identified in the failing test.
