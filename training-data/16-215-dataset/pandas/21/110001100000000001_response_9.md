Analysis:
The buggy function '_get_with' takes a key as input and returns the corresponding values based on different conditions. It makes use of related functions like '_slice', '_get_values_tuple', and 'reindex' to process the key and retrieve the values.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the different cases for the key, especially in the if-elif-else conditions.

Bug's Cause:
The bug could be caused due to incorrect checks and handling of different types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior when retrieving the values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the different key types and ensure that the correct operation is performed based on the type of key.
2. Validate the input key and perform appropriate actions based on its type.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected data type based on the key type.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list): 
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key types are properly checked along with the appropriate actions and returns based on the key type. The code now also distinguishes between scalar and non-scalar keys and handles them accordingly.
