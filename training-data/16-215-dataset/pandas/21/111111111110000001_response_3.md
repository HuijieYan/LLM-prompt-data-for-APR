The buggy function is a method named `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the pandas library. This method is responsible for handling different scenarios when indexing a series with a key. The failing test is attempting to index a `Series` with a given key, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but the error message indicates that the `KeyError` is not being raised, hence the test fails.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional blocks where it checks the type of the `key` variable and tries to handle the indexing based on its type.

The bug's cause is likely due to improper handling of the different types of keys that can be used for indexing. The method `_get_with` does not properly handle the case when a `Series` is being used as the key for indexing.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to have specific checks for when the key is a `Series` and handle it accordingly, instead of treating it like a generic iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected code, when the `key` is an instance of `Series`, it is specifically handled by reindexing the series, which should address the issue and make the failing test pass.
