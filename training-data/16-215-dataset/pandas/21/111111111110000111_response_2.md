Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements where different types of indexers are being checked (list, DataFrame, tuple, etc.) and the corresponding actions are executed based on the type of indexer.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers. The failing test is related to how a list indexer is being handled compared to other array-like indexers, and this inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for handling different types of indexers.
2. Implement similar error handling for list indexers as for other array-like indexers.
3. Update the conditional statements to handle different types of indexers consistently.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list indexer similar to other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series, pd.RangeIndex)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and addresses the specific inconsistency related to list indexers. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
