The problematic function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class. The function attempts to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalar values, and return the corresponding values from the series. The issue arises when dealing with list-like indexers.

The failing test aims to verify the behavior when using different types of indexers, such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series. The expected behavior should be consistent across these different types of indexers, but currently, the function is handling list indexers differently, leading to a KeyError in this specific case.

The source of the error is within the `_get_with` function, specifically in the part that handles the case when the indexer is list-like. The function is not handling the list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other indexer types, causing the KeyError to be raised in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers in a manner consistent with other indexer types. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent across different indexer types and that the KeyError is not raised in cases where it should not be.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        # Return the corresponding value if the key is not list-like or a scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexer types, resolving the issue reported in the failing test case. This corrected code will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
