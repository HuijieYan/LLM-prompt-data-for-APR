1. The buggy function is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series in pandas. The failing test calls the function with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects a KeyError to be raised if the indexer does not match any elements in the Series.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement that checks if `key_type` is `'string'`. This check may not accurately identify the type of the key and could lead to incorrect behavior.

3. The cause of the bug lies in the function's inability to correctly identify the type of the key, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect error handling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use more robust type checking to accurately identify the type of the key
   - Ensure uniform error handling for different types of indexers

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes more accurate type checking for the key and ensures uniform error handling for different types of indexers.

The corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
