The bug in the provided function is that the "key_type" is being incorrectly inferred as a string, leading to the wrong execution path. We need to correctly infer the type of the "key" variable based on its data type and make decisions accordingly.

To fix the bug, we will use the type information of the "key" variable to correctly infer its type. We can then use this type information to determine the correct execution path.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, we have added the inference of the "key_type" based on the type of the "key" variable using the information from the "lib.infer_dtype" function. This ensures that the correct execution path is chosen based on the inferred type of the "key" variable.

With this fix, the function should now return the expected outputs for all the provided test cases, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
