The issue is with the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers (array-like vs. list). The code does not handle the list case properly, leading to a KeyError. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior of treating array-like and list indexers the same way.

The bug is caused by not handling the list indexer properly, which results in a KeyError. This contradicts the expected behavior and causes inconsistency in the Series indexing.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to achieve consistency in Series indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, achieving consistency in Series indexing. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
