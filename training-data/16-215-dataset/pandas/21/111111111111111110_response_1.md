The issue with the provided `_get_with` function is that it is not handling list-like indexers correctly, causing inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # If key is not list-like, convert it to loc indexing
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function ensures that list-like indexers are consistently handled and that the behavior is the same for all types of indexers, in line with the expected behavior described in the failing tests.

After applying this correction, the tests should pass without raising a `KeyError` for list-like indexers, and the behavior should be consistent for all types of indexers.
