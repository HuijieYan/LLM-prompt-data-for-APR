Potential error location: The potential error in the code lies in the conditional statements for handling the different types of indexers. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the handling of list-like indexers.

Bug Cause:
- The failing test is related to the behavior of the function with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
- The error message indicates that the function behaves differently when using a list indexer compared to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and an incorrect KeyError message.
- The discrepancies between the expected and actual values of key_type suggest that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and therefore not handling it appropriately.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conditional statements in the function to properly identify and handle the different types of indexers.
2. Ensure consistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code addresses the inconsistent behavior by properly identifying and handling the different types of indexers. It ensures that the function behaves consistently regardless of the type of indexer being used.

This correction should resolve the issue in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue by ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
