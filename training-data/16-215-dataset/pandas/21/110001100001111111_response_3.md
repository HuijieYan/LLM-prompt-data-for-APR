The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. It seems that the function is not handling the list case correctly, which leads to an inconsistency in behavior.

The bug appears to be located in the section of the code where the function is handling the case when the key is a list. It is not correctly handling the list key and is causing a KeyError when trying to access the value from the Series.

The issue described in the GitHub post highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and suggests that there might not be a compelling reason for this discrepancy. It also points out that making all cases behave like the list case results in only one failing test, which was added in a specific pull request.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the list key in a consistent manner with other indexers to avoid the KeyError. It should also align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Updated this condition to handle list keys
        if not self.index.is_unique:
            raise ValueError("Reindexing only valid with uniquely valued Index objects")
        indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
        if self.index.is_boolean():
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            return self._get_values(slobj)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should now handle list keys in a consistent manner and align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
