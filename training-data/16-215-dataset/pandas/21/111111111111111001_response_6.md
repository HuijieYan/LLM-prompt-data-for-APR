The bug seems to be caused by the check for the key_type and the subsequent handling of the different key types. It seems that the code doesn't handle the case where the key is a list, and it erroneously tries to handle it as an Index or a scalar, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, you should update the key handling logic to properly handle the case where the key is a list. Additionally, you should refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
            key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected code should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test cases provided.
