The issue with the `_get_with` function seems to be with the handling of the 'key_type'. This variable is not being properly assigned, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

The 'key_type' is expected to be determined based on the input 'key'. However, the code does not seem to correctly determine the 'key_type' in various scenarios, resulting in incorrect behavior.

A possible approach to fixing this bug would be to improve the logic for determining the 'key_type' based on the input 'key'. This could involve checking the type and properties of the 'key' variable in a more robust manner, and then assigning the 'key_type' accordingly.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function considering the expected input/output variable information provided and the failing test is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should address the issues with determining the 'key_type' and will hopefully resolve the failing test and any related issues with the function.
