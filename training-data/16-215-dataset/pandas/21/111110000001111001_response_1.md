The potential error in the buggy function is that the key_type is not being correctly assigned based on the type of the 'key'. Instead, it is always being assigned the value 'integer'. This is due to the fact that the function incorrectly checks for the type of 'key' without considering the various possible types.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly determine the type of 'key' and assign the 'key_type' accordingly. This can be achieved by using isinstance checks for the different types of 'key' and then setting the 'key_type' accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = None
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = 'scalar'
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = 'loc'
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'label':
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly determine the type of 'key' and assign 'key_type' accordingly. It should satisfy all the listed expected input/output variable information.
