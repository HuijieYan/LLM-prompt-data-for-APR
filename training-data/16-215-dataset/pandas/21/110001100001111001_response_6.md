The bug in the provided code is that the type of `key` is not being correctly determined, leading to incorrect behavior in subsequent steps. The key_type variable is being incorrectly set as 'string' in all cases, regardless of the actual type of the key.

To fix this bug, we can modify the section of code where the key type is determined. We will use the correct methods to infer the type of the key and then act accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Use the correct method to determine if the key is boolean
    if com.is_bool_indexer(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Use the correct method to infer the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should now produce the expected output for all the provided test cases. It uses the appropriate methods to determine the type of the key and acts accordingly to handle different types of input.
