The problematic function in the `Series` class is `_get_with`. The function is intended to handle slicing, arrays, dataframes, and various other input types. The failing test is testing the behavior of using a key that does not match any of the index values in the series. The function raises a KeyError, but the test does not expect this behavior, so it fails.

The potential error in the function lies in the part that handles non-matching keys. The function should not raise a KeyError when a non-matching key is provided.

The bug is caused by the function not handling the case where the key does not match any of the index values in the series. This results in a KeyError being raised, which is not expected by the test.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function to handle the case where the key does not match any index values. Instead of raising a KeyError, it should return an empty series or NaN, indicating that no match was found.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if len(key) == 0:
        # Return an empty series if key is empty
        return Series()
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the case where the key does not match any index values and return an empty series or NaN. This change should make the function pass the failing test.
