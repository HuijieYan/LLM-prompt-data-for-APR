The buggy function is called `_get_with` and it is a method of the `Series` class. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `_get_with` method when different types of `key` are passed to it. The error message indicates that the method is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block where it checks `if not is_list_like(key)`. This block has multiple cases to handle different types of `key`, and it seems that the logic is not handling all cases correctly, leading to the test failures.

The bug is caused by the conditional logic not correctly handling the different types of `key` that are being passed to the `_get_with` method, resulting in unexpected behavior and failure to raise a `KeyError` when it is expected.

One approach to fix the bug is to refactor the logic inside the `_get_with` method to properly handle the different types of `key` that are being passed to it. This can involve verifying the type of `key` and executing the corresponding logic to ensure that the method behaves as expected with different types of `key` inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = key
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code assumes that `is_list_like` is a valid function for checking if an object is list-like. This may need to be replaced with a different approach if `is_list_like` is not provided by a library. Additionally, the error handling is improved to handle different types of `key` inputs as per the failing test cases.
