The buggy function appears to be trying to handle different types of key inputs, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others, and take different actions based on the type of input. However, it is not handling all cases correctly, leading to the failing tests.

The failing test is trying different types of key inputs with the Series and expects a KeyError with a specific message to be raised. The test fails because the function is not handling the key input correctly.

It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, leading to incorrect actions being taken. This is evident from the `key_type` variable always being set to `'string'`, regardless of the type of the input `key`.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to identify the type of the `key` input correctly.
2. Based on the type of the `key`, the function should take the appropriate action as per the requirement of the failing tests.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
