Issue:

The error occurs within the `_get_level_number` function, which is called by the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the level "A" is not found in the list of names.

The potential cause of this bug is that the provided level is a tuple, which is not handled correctly in the `_get_level_number` function.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle the case when the input level is a tuple and extract the necessary information from the MultiIndex accordingly.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to account for multi-level index names and properly pass the levels to the `_get_level_number` function.

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if not isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = (level,)  # Convert level to a tuple if it's not already one
    try:
        level_numbers = [self.names.index(lvl) for lvl in level]
        return level_numbers
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = index._get_level_number(clocs)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

Corrected Code:
With the above approach, the corrected code for the `_get_level_number` function will properly handle the tuple input for the `level` parameter. The corrected `_unstack_multiple` function will utilize the modified `_get_level_number` function to handle multi-level index names.

By integrating these changes, the corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
