The issue in the provided function is occurring around the handling of `clocs` and the `_get_level_number` method on the MultiIndex object. The issue arises when `clocs` is a tuple with a tuple inside it, which the current function does not handle correctly.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple containing another tuple.

Here's a modified version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):  # Check if clocs contains another tuple
        levels = []
        for cloc in clocs:
            level = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc]  # Get level numbers for each element in the inner tuple
            levels.append(level)
        clocs = levels  # Assign the list of levels to clocs

    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Keep the original logic if clocs does not contain a tuple

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This modified version of the function includes a check for whether `clocs` contains another tuple. If it does, it iterates through the inner tuple to get the level numbers for each element. Then it assigns the list of levels to `clocs`. If `clocs` does not contain a tuple, it retains the original logic to get the level numbers for the individual elements.

With this modification, the function should now be able to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple containing another tuple, and the unstacking of multi-index data with tuple names should work as expected.
