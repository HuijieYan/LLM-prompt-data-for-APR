The buggy function is failing to correctly identify the level numbers when determining the clocs variable. This is causing the subsequent operations to fail as well.

The cause of the bug is that the _get_level_number function is not correctly identifying the level number for the given level name, and as a result, it raises a ValueError or KeyError, leading to the failure of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _get_level_number function to correctly identify the level number for the given level name.
2. Verify the data and index structures to ensure that the level names and corresponding level numbers are correctly aligned.
3. Handling the exception more gracefully to avoid stopping the execution of the function entirely.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            levels = index.names
            for name in cloc:
                level_number = levels.index(name)
                cloc_numbers.append(level_number)
        else:
            level_number = index.names.index(cloc)
            cloc_numbers.append(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now correctly identify the level numbers for the given level names, and the function should pass the failing test.
