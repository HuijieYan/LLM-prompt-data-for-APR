Upon analyzing the information provided, it becomes apparent that the issue lies within the `_get_level_number` function, which is called by the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the function `names.index(level)` is unable to locate the level 'A' within the list of level names.

The issue arises due to the fact that the `MultiIndex` class is using a tuple as the name for each level, and the `_get_level_number` function is not handling this tuple format correctly.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be updated to handle tuples as level names properly. Additionally, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be modified to ensure that it calls the `_get_level_number` function correctly.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuples as level names. If the input `level` is a tuple, it should directly return it.
2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuples as level names correctly and ensure that it passes the correct values to the `_get_level_number` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_level_number` function:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        return level
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )
    try:
        return self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
```

And here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making these changes, the `_get_level_number` function will correctly handle tuples as level names, and the `_unstack_multiple` function will call it properly.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test cases.
