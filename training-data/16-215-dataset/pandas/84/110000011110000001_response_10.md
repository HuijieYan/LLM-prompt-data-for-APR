The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame from a MultiIndex. The error seems to be related to the `level` parameter not being handled properly within the function.

The failing test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` is testing the unstacking of a DataFrame from a MultiIndex using specific level names and is expecting specific results.

The error messages indicate that the function is trying to access a level that is not found in the MultiIndex.

The potential error in the `unstack` function might be in the line:
`clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`

The error seems to stem from the handling of the `level` parameter and its relationship with the `clocs` (column locations) within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to properly handle the `level` parameter and its relationship with `clocs`. The error in handling the `level` parameter might be leading to an incorrect identification of the relevant level, causing the subsequent errors. 

A possible approach to fix this bug could involve inspecting the handling of the `level` parameter and how it relates to the `clocs`. It might be necessary to identify the correct level based on the passed parameters and then proceed with the unstacking.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify the `clocs` to handle MultiIndex levels properly
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        cloc_indices = [index.names.index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_indices = clocs

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected code ensures that the `clocs` are appropriately handled for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, and the corresponding level indices are used to identify the correct column locations.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
