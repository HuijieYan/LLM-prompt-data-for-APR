The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of multiple index levels in the `_unstack_multiple` function, leading to a KeyError when trying to unstack the data using a tuple of names.

The problematic part of the code is in the function `_unstack_multiple` where it handles MultiIndex objects. This code should properly handle the case when a tuple of names is provided as the level argument and correctly handle the tuple of names.

The correct approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case when a tuple of names is provided as the level argument. This involves correctly identifying the level numbers for the given names and restructuring the data accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By modifying the function to handle the case when a tuple of names is provided as the level argument, the bug should be resolved. This updated code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
