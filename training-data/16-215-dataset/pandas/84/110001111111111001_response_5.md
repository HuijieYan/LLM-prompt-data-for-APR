The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`. The function is intended to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex based on the provided levels. However, the function seems to be encountering issues when dealing with hierarchical columns.

The error message indicates that a KeyError is being raised when trying to get the level number for 'A', implying that 'A' is not found in the list of names.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue arises from the usage of `level` as a tuple in the form `('A', 'a')` instead of 'A' or 'a' individually. This is causing the function to fail when trying to process the level number.

The exception handling in the function also seems to be throwing errors due to using 'A' as a whole tuple rather than its constituent elements.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the handling of `level` to accommodate the possibility of it being a tuple, and handle it accordingly by extracting individual elements if required.
2. Ensure that the function can handle both individual elements and tuples as input for levels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code remains the same

    # Modify the way clocs is processed to handle both individual elements and tuples
    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        # Handle the case where cloc is a tuple
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.extend([index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc])
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This corrected code should address the issues and ensure that the function can handle both individual elements and tuples as input for levels, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output requirements.
