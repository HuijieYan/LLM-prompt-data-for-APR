The error is caused by the `_get_level_number` function within the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file which is being called by the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling hierarchical columns correctly. This results in the error message "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" or "KeyError: 'Level A not found" being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function correctly handles hierarchical columns. This can be achieved by properly handling the hierarchical structure of the columns and making sure that the indexing is performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # handling hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple, which indicates a hierarchical column. We call `_get_level_number` with the entire tuple to correctly handle the hierarchical structure.

This correction should ensure that the function handles hierarchical columns properly and resolves the errors encountered in the failing tests.
