The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is used to reshape a pandas DataFrame or Series using `unstack`. The function is attempting to determine the level number for the columns by iterating over the provided column locations (`clocs`) and using the `index._get_level_number` method. This is causing the error as the function is not able to correctly handle the case of multi-level column names.

The failing test cases are attempting to use the `unstack` method on a DataFrame in conjunction with a MultiIndex with tuple names. This is triggering the error where the level 'A' is not found.

The GitHub issue is related to this bug and provides a clear example of the problem occurring in practice.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to properly handle MultiIndex columns, including tuple names.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Determine if the data object has MultiIndex columns
    is_multicolumn = isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex)

    if is_multicolumn:
        # If the data has MultiIndex columns, directly unstack it
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # If not a multi-column, create a dummy MultiIndex for unstacking
        dummy_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(None, col) for col in data.columns],
                                                  names=[None, data.columns.name])
        dummy = pd.DataFrame(data.values, index=data.index, columns=dummy_columns)
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By checking if the input data has MultiIndex columns and handling the unstacking accordingly, the function should now be able to handle both single-level and multi-level column names, resolving the issue.

With this correction, the failing tests should now pass, demonstrating that the bug has been fixed.
