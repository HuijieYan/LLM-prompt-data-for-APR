The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be in the way it handles the reshaping of the data when hierarchical columns are involved. The function attempts to unstack the data based on the specified column locations but fails to account for the presence of hierarchical columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle hierarchical columns properly and ensure that the reshaping of the data takes into account the levels of the hierarchical columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the unstacking of the data, accounting for hierarchical columns if present, and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
