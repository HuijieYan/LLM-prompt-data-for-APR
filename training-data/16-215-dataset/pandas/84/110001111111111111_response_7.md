The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to correctly process the input parameters and produce the expected output. The error occurs when trying to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` for the provided clocs. This results in a KeyError during the test execution.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the MultiIndex levels and labels during the unstacking process. The function is not correctly identifying the level number and is consequently raising a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the MultiIndex levels and labels, as well as accurately identifies the level number for unstacking.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for determining the level number using the `index._get_level_number` method to accurately identify the level based on the input parameters.
2. Verify that the function correctly processes the MultiIndex levels and labels when unstacking, ensuring that the expected output is produced.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.levels[i] for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value, verify_integrity=False)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the failing test cases. It addresses the bug by accurately identifying the level number and correctly processing the MultiIndex levels and labels during the unstacking process.
