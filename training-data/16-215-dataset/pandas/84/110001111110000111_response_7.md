The bug seems to be caused by an issue with how the `_get_level_number` function is being used within the `_unstack_multiple` function, leading to a KeyError.

The `_unstack_multiple` function is attempting to get the level number for each level in `clocs` using the `index._get_level_number` method. This method is throwing a KeyError, indicating that it cannot find the level.

The failing test provided involves unstacking a MultiIndex using tuple names ("A", "a"). This test is failing due to the KeyError caused by the `_get_level_number` function.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where the level is specified using tuple names. It seems that the `_unstack_multiple` function is expecting a single level name, but the failing test is providing a tuple of names.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Wrap single tuple in list

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `clocs` argument is a tuple, and if so, we wrap it in a list. Then, we use a list comprehension to get the level numbers for all levels in `clocs`, and proceed with the rest of the function as before.

This corrected version should handle both single level names and tuple names correctly.

After implementing this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
