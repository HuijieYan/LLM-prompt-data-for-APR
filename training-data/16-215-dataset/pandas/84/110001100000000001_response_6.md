1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is meant to unstack the data based on the column locations provided in the input parameters. It seems to be related to the `unstack` function from the same file, which is used to unstack a Series or DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function may be the logic for unstacking the data based on the column locations.

3. The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to the unstacking logic, especially when the input data is a DataFrame with hierarchical columns. The bug may be causing incorrect unstacking of the data, leading to unexpected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing and updating the logic for unstacking hierarchical columns in the DataFrame.
   - Ensuring that the unstacked output maintains the integrity of the index and columns, especially when dealing with MultiIndex columns.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        for loc in clocs[1:]:
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

Note: This corrected code assumes that the goal is to unstack the data based on the column locations provided in the `clocs` parameter. The logic for unstacking has been updated to handle hierarchical columns in the DataFrame as well as Series.
