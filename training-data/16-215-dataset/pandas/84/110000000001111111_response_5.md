The issue with the code is that it is not properly handling the MultiIndex with tuple names. The error is occurring when the function is trying to get the level number using the tuple names.

The potential error location within the function is the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line, where it tries to get the level number using the tuple names.

The bug's cause is based on the fact that the function is not handling tuple names in the MultiIndex properly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and perform the unstack operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the names of the clocs if they are tuples
    cloc_names = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = tuple(str(x) for x in cloc)
        cloc_names.append(cloc)

    unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_names, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle MultiIndex with tuple names and perform the unstack operation accordingly. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
