The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering an error when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple instead of a list. This is causing the function to try and use the tuple elements as levels, resulting in a `ValueError` and subsequently a `KeyError`.

The issue arises from the fact that the `_unstack_multiple` function assumes that `clocs` is a list, and attempts to use the `_get_level_number` method with the elements of `clocs` as input. This method expects the input to be a single level name or number, but when `clocs` is a tuple, it tries to access the elements of the tuple as individual level names or numbers, leading to the errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple. We can do this by checking the type of `clocs` and converting it to a list if it's a tuple before processing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `clocs` is a tuple and convert it to a list if necessary. This ensures that the subsequent processing of `clocs` will proceed as expected, without trying to use tuple elements as individual level names or numbers.

After making this modification, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
