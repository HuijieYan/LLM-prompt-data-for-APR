The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to the incorrect handling of the naming convention in the MultiIndex. The `_get_level_number` function is not able to handle the tuple names properly, leading to a KeyError.

The problem is occurring in the following section of the code:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The function `_get_level_number` is unable to handle tuple names properly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be modified to handle tuple names in MultiIndex properly. The function should be able to identify and retrieve the level number for tuple names without raising a KeyError.

The corrected code for the `_get_level_number` function should resolve the issue:
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except (ValueError, KeyError):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level = [self.names.index(name) for name in level]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found") from None
    return level
```
By modifying the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names and raise a KeyError only if the level is not found, the bug should be fixed.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function will be able to properly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex and pass the failing test. This should also satisfy the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # (Rest of the function remains unchanged)
    ...
```
After making these changes, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
