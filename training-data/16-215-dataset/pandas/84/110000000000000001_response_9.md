1. The buggy function is supposed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on the provided column locations and fill_value. It handles both single and multiindex dataframes and series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the part where it checks the type of the input data and performs unstacking accordingly.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the unstacking of multiindex columns, leading to incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles the unstacking of multiindex columns for both DataFrame and Series inputs.
   - Checking the index type (SingleIndex or MultiIndex) and implementing the unstacking accordingly.
   - Verifying the codes and levels used during the unstacking process to ensure accuracy.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
