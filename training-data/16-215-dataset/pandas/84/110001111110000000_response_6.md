To fix the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas library, the body of the `unstack` function should be used instead of the `_unstack_multiple`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    # This function is not actually necessary because it simply calls the unstack method on the input data
    return data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
```

With this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function is no longer required and the actual unstack method from the input data is used directly. This will resolve the issues raised in the failing tests, as the unstack method is substituted with the `_unstack_multiple` function.
