The potential error in the problematic function lies in the line where it attempts to get the level number for each value in the 'clocs' list using the 'index._get_level_number(i)' function. This could be causing the KeyError as reported in the GitHub issue because it is not handling hierarchical columns properly.

The bug's cause is the function's inability to handle hierarchical columns properly when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle hierarchical columns and unstack MultiIndex with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        return data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
    elif isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        return data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This code simplifies the _unstack_multiple function to directly call the unstack method of the input data, whether it's a Series or DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
