The issue seems to be related to the unstacking of a MultiIndexed Series in Pandas when using tuple names for the levels. The bug appears to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function, as it is not properly handling the case where the input index has multi-levels with tuple names.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part that handles the extraction of level numbers using `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The bug seems to be caused by the code not properly handling the tuple names of the MultiIndex. This leads to the KeyError when trying to unstack the Series using the tuple names as levels.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the extraction of level numbers when the index has tuple names as levels. Additionally, the function should handle the unstacking of the MultiIndex with tuple names properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    levels = [cloc[0] if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else cloc for cloc in clocs]
    clocs = [index.get_level_number(cloc) if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else cloc for cloc in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function uses the `get_level_number` method to handle both single-level and multi-level indices with tuple names. It properly extracts the level numbers and unstacks the index based on the given levels.

By using this corrected function, the unstacking of the MultiIndexed Series with tuple names as levels should work as expected, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
