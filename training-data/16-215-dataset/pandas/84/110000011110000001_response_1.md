The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` takes in a DataFrame and unstacks the specified level. The error message mentions a `ValueError` and a `KeyError` occurring at `_get_level_number` when trying to find the level number for a given level.

The problem occurs because the function assumes that the level passed is a string, while in some cases, it is a tuple due to the multi-index. This causes the function to fail and raise errors.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle both single and multi-levels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert single level to list to handle both single and multi-levels in the subsequent steps
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
```

With this fix, the function should be able to handle both single and multi-levels, resolving the `ValueError` and `KeyError` issues. This should make the function pass the failing test.
