The problem with the buggy function is that the logic for unstacking the data is not handled correctly. The current implementation doesn't properly handle the hierarchical index and doesn't properly unstack the data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for unstacking the data and properly handle the hierarchical index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases. It properly handles the unstacking of the data based on the specified column locations.
