The provided buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`, which is called by the `unstack` method in the Pandas library. The failing tests indicate that when trying to unstack a multi-index with tuple names, it triggers a `KeyError` or `ValueError` due to a problem in the `_get_level_number` method of the `Index` class. This issue is reflected in the GitHub issue as well.

The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the way it handles tuple names in the multi-index. Specifically, the `_get_level_number` method is not handling tuple names properly, leading to the `KeyError` or `ValueError` when attempting to unstack a multi-index with tuple names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle tuple names in the multi-index, ensuring that the `_get_level_number` method works correctly with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Modify the following block of code to handle tuple names in the multi-index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (tuple, list)) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we modified the handling of `clocs` to account for whether it's a tuple or list. If it is a tuple, we pass the entire tuple to `_get_level_number`, otherwise, we pass it as a list. This modification is done to ensure that the `_get_level_number` method can handle tuple names correctly.

With these corrections, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now properly handle tuple names in the multi-index and successfully pass the failing tests. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
