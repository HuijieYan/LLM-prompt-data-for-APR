```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Convert clocs into list if it's not already
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Unchanged code below
```

The issue lies in the fact that the variable `clocs` may be either a tuple or a list, but the code expects it to be a list in order to iterate over its elements. Therefore, we fix this issue by checking if `clocs` is already a list and converting it to a list if it's not.
