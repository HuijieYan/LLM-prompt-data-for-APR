The issue with the `index._get_level_number` in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing the KeyError. This error occurs because the `level` parameter passed to `_get_level_number` is a tuple, and the function is expecting an integer.

The potential error location is within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.

The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class not being able to handle tuple input as level names.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names by checking if the current `i` in `clocs` is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we can directly access the names using `index.names.index(i)`. 

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this correction, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test. This fix will handle tuple level names correctly in the `_unstack_multiple` function, resolving the KeyError issue.

The corrected code should address the problem and align with the expected functionality.
