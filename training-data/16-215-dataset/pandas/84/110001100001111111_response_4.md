The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tuple names in the `clocs` parameter in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The function tries to find the level numbers for each element in `clocs` by calling the private method `_get_level_number` for each element. This approach is incorrect when dealing with tuple names.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to review the implementation of `_unstack_multiple` and handle the `clocs` parameter correctly when it includes tuple names.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    new_columns = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return new_columns
```

By using the `unstack` method directly on the `data` object with the `clocs` parameter, we can correctly handle tuple names and unstack the data as expected.

This correction should resolve the GitHub issue and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information.
