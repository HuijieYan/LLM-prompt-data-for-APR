The issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. When `clocs` contains tuple names, the function fails to handle them properly, resulting in a KeyError. This error occurs because the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class expects the level to be a string, rather than a tuple.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(*i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `_get_level_number` method will correctly handle both string levels and tuple names when unstacking. This should resolve the KeyError issue and allow the function to unstack correctly with tuple names in multiindex.
