From the code and error messages provided, it seems that the issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` function inside the `_unstack_multiple` function. This function is attempting to locate a level within the `MultiIndex` but is failing to do so, resulting in a `ValueError` and `KeyError`.

The problem seems to stem from the fact that `clocs` contains tuples representing levels in the MultiIndex, but the `_get_level_number` function expects a string as the `level` parameter. This mismatch is leading to the errors.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function should be modified to handle the input parameter correctly and retrieve the level number from the MultiIndex. Additionally, the code in the `_unstack_multiple` function that interacts with the MultiIndex levels should be adjusted to use the correct levels and handle the tuples appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged as it is not directly related to the bug
```

This updated `_unstack_multiple` function should fix the issues identified in the failing tests and error messages. However, further testing is required to ensure that the function works as expected in all scenarios.
