The issue seems to stem from the `_unstack_multiple` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `clocs` is a list or tuple, and if not, convert it to a list. Then, we check if each level in `clocs` is found in the index names, and retrieve the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` if it is. This should resolve the `KeyError` that was occurring in the unstack operation for multi-index data.
