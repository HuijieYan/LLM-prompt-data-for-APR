The issue in the `unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to an incorrect interpretation of the input `clocs`. The function attempts to extract the level number from the index using the elements of the `clocs` tuple, but it fails to handle the hierarchical column names properly.

The root cause of the issue seems to be a misinterpretation of the input `clocs` and a failure to handle hierarchical column names.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to modify the function to properly handle hierarchical column names and extract the level numbers accordingly. This might involve checking if the columns are MultiIndex and unstacking them appropriately, while also ensuring that the level numbers are extracted correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    else:
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This corrected version should address the issue of unstacking with tuple names and hierarchical columns. It checks if the columns are a MultiIndex and unstacks them accordingly, taking into account the hierarchical structure.

By applying these changes to the function, it should now properly handle unstacking with tuple names and hierarchical columns, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub case.
