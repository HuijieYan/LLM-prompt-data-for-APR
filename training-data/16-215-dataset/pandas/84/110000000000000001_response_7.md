The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the case when the input data is a DataFrame with hierarchical columns.

The bug is likely caused by the function not correctly handling the case when the input data has hierarchical columns. This can lead to errors in the unstacking process and result in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when the input data has hierarchical columns and ensure that the unstacking process is performed correctly in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
