### Bug Analysis
The `__placeholder__` level is causing errors when unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex. The `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas` library is failing to correctly handle the multi-level indices when unstacking.

The error occurs because the code tries to get the level number by passing a tuple of names to the MultiIndex object. This is causing the `_get_level_number` function to fail, leading to a ValueError.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is that the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` doesn't handle the case of unstacking with tuple names properly. It needs to be updated to accommodate this use case.

### Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to deal with unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the code that tries to get the level number to handle multiple levels in the MultiIndex.

### Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # Change the following line:
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # to:
    for loc in clocs:
        if not isinstance(loc, int):
            loc = index._get_level_number(loc)
    # This change will handle the case when clocs contains tuples of names

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and pass the failing test.

This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError".
