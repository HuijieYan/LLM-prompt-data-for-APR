The potential error in the function `_unstack_multiple` lies in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is not able to find the level 'A' within the MultiIndex. This is causing a KeyError in the code.

Based on the failing test and the error message from the GitHub issue, it appears that the function is unable to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly, leading to an issue with finding the level.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly. It should be able to correctly identify the specified levels and perform the unstack operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same as the original function
```

By checking if the index is a tuple in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]`, we can handle the MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring.

This correction should allow the function `_unstack_multiple` to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly, resolving the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
