The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering an error because of the way it attempts to use the level information provided in the `clocs` parameter. It appears that the function is not handling nested tuples correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it tries to handle the level information provided in the `clocs` parameter.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
- The failing test is expecting the function to correctly handle the unstacking of multi-level indices and returning a DataFrame with the expected structure.
- However, the error message indicates that the function is encountering issues with locating the specified levels in the MultiIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Revising the logic within the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle nested tuples within the `clocs` parameter.
- Ensuring that the function adequately checks for the presence of names or levels within the MultiIndex before attempting to use them.

Here's a corrected version for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert tuple to list for handling nested tuples
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (rest of the function logic)

    return unstacked
```

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected function to ensure that it passes the failing test and provides the expected output values for the given input parameters.
