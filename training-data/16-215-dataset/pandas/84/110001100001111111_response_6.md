## Bug Analysis
1. The `unstack` method fails with a `KeyError` when attempting to unstack using tuple names like `("A", "a")`.
2. This issue is related to the `_unstack_multiple` function.
3. The input/output variable information does not match the expected values.
4. The issue on GitHub indicates that the method is unable to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names.

## Bug Cause
The `_unstack_multiple` function fails to correctly handle the MultiIndex with tuple names, leading to a `KeyError`.

## Possible Approaches
1. Ensure that the index levels are properly extracted and used.
2. Handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # New code to handle tuple names

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
By adding a conditional statement to handle tuple names, the bug can be fixed.
