The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by improper handling of MultiIndex levels and names when unstacking.

The function fails to correctly identify the level numbers for the given level names, resulting in a KeyError. This is evident from the GitHub issue where unstacking using tuple names ("A", "a") raises a KeyError for 'Level A not found'.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the level names and convert them to level numbers in order to perform the unstacking operation.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the level names and convert them to level numbers for unstacking. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.

It's important to note that the corrected function may need to be further tested to ensure that it behaves as expected across various scenarios.
