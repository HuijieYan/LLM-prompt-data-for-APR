1. The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the GitHub issue because it is part of the code execution sequence that causes the KeyError during the unstacking of multi-index columns.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the portion of the code where it tries to identify the level numbers corresponding to the column names when unstacking multi-index columns.

3. (a). The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to handle the unstacking of multi-index columns in Pandas but encounters issues with identifying the level numbers corresponding to the column names, which leads to a KeyError.
   (b). The GitHub issue highlights the failure of unstacking multi-index columns with tuple names, resulting in a ValueError and subsequent KeyError due to level numbers not being found.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be updated to accurately determine the level numbers for the specified column names and handle multi-index columns with tuple names more effectively.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (list, tuple)) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function implementation remains as is
```

In the corrected code, the level numbers for the column names are determined considering the possibility of column names being in tuple format. This will address the error encountered when unstacking multi-index columns with tuple names.
