1. The buggy function is an internal function used by the `pandas` library to perform unstack operations on MultiIndexed data. The GitHub issue highlights a specific case where the `unstack` operation fails with a KeyError when provided with a tuple of names for unstacking. The issue seems to be related to the handling of hierarchical columns in the MultiIndexed data, as the error message references the failure to find a specific level when unstacking.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line, where `index._get_level_number(i)` tries to retrieve the level number for each element in `clocs`, which might be causing the failure.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `clocs` being passed to the function is a list of names for columns to unstack, but the function seems to be treating them as level numbers directly.
   (b). The GitHub issue information points to a failure in finding the specified levels when unstacking using tuples of names.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Adjusting the function to correctly handle columns specified by their names and resolve them to level numbers.
   - Addressing the issue where unstacking with tuple names fails, ensuring that the function can handle hierarchical column indices properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = index.get_level_values(clocs)
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the `get_level_values` method to retrieve the level numbers for the specified column names. It also adjusts the unstack operation based on whether there are remaining levels to unstack after the specified columns. This revised implementation aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub post while also improving the overall handling of unstacking MultiIndexed data.
