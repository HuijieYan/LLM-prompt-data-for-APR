The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used for unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function attempts to get the level number for each level passed as an argument, but it fails when trying to retrieve the level number because it expects the level to be given as an integer instead of the level name or tuple. This results in a KeyError or ValueError. The failing test cases indicate that the unstacking process with MultiIndex and tuple names is not being handled correctly, leading to the errors.

The bug's cause is the function's assumption that the levels provided in the `clocs` parameter are integers representing the level number, when they are actually level names or tuples.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the provided level identifiers correctly and should be able to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the code ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function checks if the provided level identifiers are integers. If not, it retrieves the level number using `index.names.index(i)`. This allows the function to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex and tuple names.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
