The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_get_level_number` function in the `MultiIndex` class. The error occurs when the `index._get_level_number(i)` line is executed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. This error is indicated by both the ValueError and KeyError exceptions.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function is attempting to access level names that do not exist within the `MultiIndex` object. This could be due to discrepancies between the levels in the index and the names provided as input.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the level names and the levels themselves are aligned correctly. This can be achieved by properly handling the level names and ensuring that they correspond to the existing levels in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged as it is working as expected

    clocs = [data.columns._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex) else data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged as it is working as expected
```

The suggested fix involves fetching the level numbers from `data.columns` if it is a `MultiIndex`, otherwise from `data.index`. This will ensure that the correct level numbers are used to unstack the data.
