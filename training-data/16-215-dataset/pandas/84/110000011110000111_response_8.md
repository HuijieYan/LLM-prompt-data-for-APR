The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the error in the test cases. The function attempts to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on certain column locations, but it is not handling MultiIndex with tuple names properly.

The failing test features unstacking with MultiIndex having tuple names, and the error message indicates that the function is failing to get the level number from the MultiIndex. The error is caused by the function trying to retrieve the level number based on the tuple names in the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError because it's unable to find the level name.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly and extract the level numbers from the MultiIndex based on the tuple names.

The corrected function for `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_indices = [index.names.index(cloc) if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else index.names.index((cloc,)) for cloc in clocs]

    rloc_indices = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    dummy_index = index.copy()

    for cloc in cloc_indices:
        dummy_index = dummy_index.unstack(level=cloc, fill_value=fill_value)

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

    return dummy
```

This corrected function uses the `unstack` method directly on the MultiIndex to handle the unstacking based on the column locations. It properly handles MultiIndex with tuple names and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
