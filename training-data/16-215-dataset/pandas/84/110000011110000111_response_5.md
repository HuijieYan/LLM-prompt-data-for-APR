The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a Series or DataFrame with a MultiIndex. It tries to unstack the data based on the specified level(s) using the `unstack` method. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is failing to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError or ValueError.

The source code of the function suggests that the issue might be in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex, where it is trying to identify the level number for the given level name(s). This method is likely failing to handle tuple names correctly, leading to the errors.

The failing tests provide a clear indication of the bug, especially the error messages, which show that the function is unable to handle tuple names within the MultiIndex. The GitHub issue also presents a clear scenario where unstacking with tuple names fails and provides a detailed trace of the error.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly. This may involve adjusting the logic around identifying level numbers and modifying the unstacking process to accommodate tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        # Flatten the tuple names to handle them correctly
        clocs = [c for level in clocs for c in level]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ... (rest of the code)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the passed level(s) are tuples, and if so, we flatten them to handle them correctly. This modification should address the issue of unstacking with tuple names and align with the expected behavior as per the failing test and GitHub issue.
