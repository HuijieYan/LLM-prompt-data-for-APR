The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function fails to handle hierarchical columns and also encounters errors due to attempting to access levels and codes from the index of the DataFrame. The error messages indicate that the function is unable to locate the specified levels, and attempts to index them cause errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be refactored to correctly handle hierarchical columns and index attributes. 

The potential error location within the function is the code that handles hierarchical columns and attempts to access levels and codes from the index.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling hierarchical columns and is incorrectly accessing levels and codes from the index. This leads to errors when attempting to retrieve specific levels and codes.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to handle hierarchical columns correctly and use the appropriate methods to access levels and codes from the index.

Here's a possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle hierarchical columns by identifying and unstacking the specified levels in the MultiIndex.
2. Use the `.remove_unused_levels()` method to remove any unused levels after unstacking.
3. Validate the index and columns of the resulting DataFrame to ensure they match the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    level_names = [c[0] if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]
    result = data.unstack(level_names, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Remove any unused levels after unstacking
    result.columns = result.columns.remove_unused_levels()

    return result
```

This corrected code ensures that the function correctly handles hierarchical columns and unstacks the specified levels from the MultiIndex. It also removes any unused levels from the resulting DataFrame columns. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
