Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This is where the `KeyError` is being raised, indicating that the level "A" is not found.

Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function's inability to handle MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names. The error arises because the function fails to recognize the tuple names when trying to unstack the data.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The function should be modified to handle MultiIndexed data with tuple names.
2. It should be able to properly identify and unstack the multi-level indexes without encountering a KeyError related to tuple names.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # get level number for each index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By modifying the `clocs` list comprehension to check if the item is an integer or a tuple, and then appropriately getting the level number, we can ensure that the function can handle MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names without raising a KeyError. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
