The bug seems to be in the _unstack_multiple function, particularly at the section where it handles the clocs input parameter. The function is not correctly handling the cases where clocs is a tuple of tuples, and it is failing to properly identify the levels of the MultiIndex.

This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where a similar error is being raised when trying to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex, specifically when using a tuple as the level parameter.

To fix this bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to be updated to properly handle the clocs input parameter, and correctly identify the levels of the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the level numbers of the clocs
    index = data.index
    levels = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if len(levels) == 1:
        # Handle the case where clocs is a single tuple
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=levels[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Handle the case where clocs is a tuple of tuples
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function includes a conditional statement to differentiate between the cases where clocs is a single tuple or a tuple of tuples, and then uses the appropriate method to unstack the data.

This corrected function should now properly handle the cases where clocs is a tuple of tuples, and should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
