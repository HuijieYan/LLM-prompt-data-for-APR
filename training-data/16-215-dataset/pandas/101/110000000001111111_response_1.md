The bug is related to the function astype_nansafe, which is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The expected and actual input/output variable information provides details about the expected behavior of the function and the discrepancies in the output.

The GitHub issue "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" provides additional context about the problem. It explains that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, the function converts NaN to an incorrect negative integer value, which is unexpected behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code handling datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype conversion. The function seems to mishandle the conversion of NaN values.

The bug's cause is related to the mishandling of NaN values during the conversion from categorical to integer dtype.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Handling NaN values appropriately during the conversion process.
2. Ensuring that the function checks for NaN values and handles them according to the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if str(arr.dtype) in ['category', 'object']:
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            if skipna:
                return arr.fillna(-1).astype(dtype)
            else:
                return arr.astype(dtype)
        elif dtype in [np.float, np.float64]:
            return arr.fillna(np.nan).astype(dtype)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This corrected function ensures that NaN values are handled appropriately when converting from categorical to integer dtype or float dtype. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
