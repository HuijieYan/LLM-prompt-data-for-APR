The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input array contains 'NaT' values and is being cast to an integer type. The failing test is expecting a ValueError to be raised when this occurs, but the current implementation does not raise the error as expected.

To fix the bug, we will need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle the case when the input array contains 'NaT' values and is being cast to an integer type. The code should explicitly check for this case and raise a ValueError with an appropriate message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this updated implementation, the function explicitly checks if the input array contains 'NaT' values and if the dtype is an integer type. If both conditions are met, it raises a ValueError as expected. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.

With this correction, the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should pass the failing test case.
