The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is used to cast the elements of an array to a given data type in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is testing the function with `NaT` values for `np.datetime64` and `np.timedelta64` types, and is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function is not raising the error as expected. This is causing the test to fail.

The related function `astype_nansafe` is called with the input array and data type, and it internally performs checks and conversions to cast the array to the specified data type.

The failing test is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised when the function is called with `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")`, which is not happening. This discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior is causing the test to fail.

The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" is unrelated to the failing test for the `astype_nansafe` function. The issue is related to converting categorical data to integer data type and the incorrect handling of NaN values in the conversion process.

To fix the bug in the `astype_nansafe` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly raises a `ValueError` when attempting to cast `NaT` values for `np.datetime64` and `np.timedelta64` types.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if dtype == np.int64 and np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

This updated version of the function checks if the input array contains NaN values and the data type is `np.int64`, and raises a `ValueError` accordingly.

With this fix, the function should now correctly raise a `ValueError` for `NaT` values, and the failing test should pass.
