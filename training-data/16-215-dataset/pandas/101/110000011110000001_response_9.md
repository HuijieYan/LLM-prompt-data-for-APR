The failing test is trying to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer using the `astype_nansafe` function. The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function did not raise a ValueError as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code where it checks for NaT values and tries to convert them to integer. The function does not handle NaT values properly and may not raise the ValueError when it encounters them.

The bug's cause is that the `astype_nansafe` function does not handle NaT values properly and does not raise a ValueError when trying to convert them to integers.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to explicitly check for NaT values and raise a ValueError if it encounters them. This will ensure that the function handles NaT values properly and raises the expected error.

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function will now handle NaT values properly and raise a ValueError when trying to convert them to integers. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
