The bug in the "astype_nansafe" function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of NaN values when casting categorical data to an integer dtype. The function does not appropriately handle NaN values when converting categorical data to integers, leading to unexpected results.

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to add a check for NaN values in the categorical data and replace them with NaN in the integer dtype before performing the conversion.

Here's a corrected version of the "astype_nansafe" function:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy import timedelta64
from numpy import datetime64
from numpy import dtype
from numpy import ndarray

def astype_nansafe(arr: ndarray, dtype: dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if str(arr.dtype) == 'category' and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        arr = arr.astype('Int64')  # Convert to nullable integer dtype

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return arr
```

This corrected function checks if the input array is of type 'category' and if the desired dtype is an integer. If both conditions are true, it converts the array to a nullable integer dtype before performing the rest of the operations.

This should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensure that NaN values in categorical data are appropriately handled when converting to integer dtype.
