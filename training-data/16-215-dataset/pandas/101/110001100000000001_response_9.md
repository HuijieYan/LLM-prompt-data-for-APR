The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition `if np.isfinite(arr).all():`, where a ValueError is raised if non-finite values (NA or inf) are present and the function tries to convert them to an integer.

The cause of the bug is that it does not handle non-finite values properly and raises a ValueError. This makes the function not "nan-safe" as intended.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle non-finite values gracefully, either by ignoring them or transforming them in a way that is consistent with the "nan-safe" requirement.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other parts of the code)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            if skipna:
                arr = arr.copy()
                arr[~np.isfinite(arr)] = np.nan
            else:
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... (remaining parts of the code)
```

In the corrected code, the `if np.isfinite(arr).all():` condition has been modified to handle non-finite values based on the value of the `skipna` parameter. If `skipna` is True, non-finite values are replaced with NaN, and if `skipna` is False, a ValueError is raised. This modification ensures that the function behaves in a "nan-safe" manner, as intended.
