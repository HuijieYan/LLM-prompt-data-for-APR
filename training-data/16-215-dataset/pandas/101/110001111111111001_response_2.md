The bug seems to be related to the dtype conversion, specifically when converting NaT (Not a Time) values to integer types. The failing test is checking if the function raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integer types np.datetime64 and np.timedelta64.

The buggy function is attempting to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It checks the dtype and the type of the input array and makes the necessary conversions. However, the bug seems to be in the handling of NaT values when converting to integer types.

The failing test indicates that the function is not properly handling the conversion of NaT values to integer, resulting in a failure to raise a ValueError as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should include specific handling for the conversion of NaT values to integer types np.datetime64 and np.timedelta64. This would involve a more robust check for NaT values and proper error handling.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    if arr.dtype == np.datetime64:
        if dtype == np.int64:
            if np.isnat(arr):
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    if arr.dtype == np.timedelta64:
        if dtype == np.int64:
            if np.isnat(arr):
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This fix specifically checks if the input array `arr` has a dtype of np.datetime64 or np.timedelta64 and if the dtype to be converted to is np.int64. If so, it checks if the array contains NaT values and raises a ValueError if it does. This addresses the issue highlighted in the failing test.

This revised function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information.
