Analyzing the buggy function and the related functions, along with the GitHub issue, it can be inferred that the bug occurs when converting a categorical series back into an integer column. The issue arises when NaN values in the categorical series are converted to an incorrect negative integer value. The cause of the bug lies in the `astype_nansafe` function, where the conversion of NaN to an integer is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to ensure that NaN values in the categorical series are correctly converted to NaN in the integer type. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the dtype is not understood, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle NaN values in the categorical series when converting to an integer type.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles cases where the dtype is not understood, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. Modify the code to return NaN when NaN values are encountered during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # code to handle conversion of categorical series to integer type
    if pd.api.types.is_categorical(arr) and dtype == np.int64:
        return arr.astype(pd.Int64Dtype()).astype(dtype)

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if pd.api.types.is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

The corrected code includes a specific check to handle the conversion of categorical series to an integer type, ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled. This modification should address the issue reported on the GitHub page.
