The bug seems to occur when attempting to convert categorical data to an integer and ignoring NaN values, leading to unexpected behavior. The failing test is showing that the function `astype_nansafe` is failing to raise a ValueError when trying to cast NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer.

The cause of the bug could lie in the section of code that handles the conversion of datetime/timedelta types, as well as in the section that handles the conversion of categorical data. The test case provided in the GitHub issue also indicates that the bug pertains to converting categorical data with NaN values to integers.

To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be modified to handle categorical data and NaN values correctly when casting to an integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code here...

    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if is_integer_dtype(dtype) and pd.isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # existing code here...
```

This modification checks if the input array is of categorical data type and if the dtype being converted to is an integer. If both conditions are met and there are NaN values in the array, it raises a ValueError to handle the case of converting categorical NaN values to integer.

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of categorical data with NaN values to an integer type, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
