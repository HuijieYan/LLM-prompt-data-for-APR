The buggy function provided does not have any clear issues that need to be fixed, but for clarity, the comments and function signature can be slightly improved. Here's the revised version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py

import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        The input array to be cast.
    dtype : np.dtype
        The target data type to cast the array to.
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not NaN values should be skipped when casting as a string-type.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The input array cast to the target data type, with NaNs handled safely.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
