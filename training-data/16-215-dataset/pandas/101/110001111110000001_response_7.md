The error in the code is caused by the incorrect handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when converting to integer types. The failing test is specifically checking for the ability to convert NaT values to integer, and the current implementation does not handle this properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains the same

    # handle NaT values for integer type conversion
    if arr.dtype == np.dtype('datetime64[ns]') or arr.dtype == np.dtype('timedelta64[ns]'):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            if np.isnat(arr).any():
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the above conditional check and handling, we can ensure that the function properly raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integer types. This corrected implementation should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
