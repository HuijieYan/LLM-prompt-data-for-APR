The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, it currently has some issues, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Upon analysis, it appears that the bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of `NaT` values when casting to `int` in the case of datetime and timedelta arrays.

To resolve the bug, the function needs to handle the case of casting `NaT` values to `int` in datetime and timedelta arrays correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import pandas_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype


def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not to skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if issubclass(dtype.type, np.integer):
            return arr.view(dtype)
        elif dtype == np.float64:
            result = arr.astype(dtype)
            result[arr.isnat()] = np.nan
            return result
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a datetimelike from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if issubclass(dtype.type, np.integer):
            return arr.view(dtype)
        elif dtype == np.float64:
            result = arr.astype(dtype)
            result[arr.isnat()] = np.nan
            return result
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    else:
        if is_object_dtype(arr):
            raise TypeError("Cannot astype non-datetime/timedelta arrays in a nan-safe manner")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)


# The related functions and the failing test remain unchanged
# The corrected astype_nansafe function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information as well as the failing test case.
```

With this corrected code, the `astype_nansafe` function should now correctly handle the casting of `NaT` values to `int` in the case of datetime and timedelta arrays, as well as pass the failing test case. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
