1. The buggy function is designed to perform a frame operation by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation for different types of input. However, there seems to be an issue with the implementation of the different cases for the input types.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conditional checks for different types of inputs, such as scalar, DataFrame, and Series, and the corresponding operations defined for each case.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional checks and operations defined for the different types of inputs (scalar, DataFrame, Series) are not implemented correctly, leading to potential errors and incorrect behavior when the function is invoked with different input types.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Refactoring the conditional checks and operations to ensure that the correct type of input is being handled appropriately.
   - Ensuring that the operations defined for each input type are compatible with the input and expected output.
   - Adding proper validation and error handling for unexpected input types.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
import pandas.core.common as com

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = com.apply_if_callable(right)
    new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- I replaced the complex conditional checks and column-based operations with a simpler and more consistent approach using the `apply` method of DataFrames, which automatically dispatches to the Series implementation based on the input types.
- I also used the `apply_if_callable` function from Pandas to ensure that the `right` input is converted to the appropriate type for the operation.
