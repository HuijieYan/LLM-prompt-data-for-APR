The problem occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when attempting to perform an arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The function dispatches the operation to individual columns for evaluation but encounters issues when handling NaT values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the cases where the right operand is a scalar or a Series. For scalars, we need to check if the scalar is a NaT value and handle it accordingly. For Series, we need to properly align the index before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = pd.Series(right) if not isinstance(right, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)) else right

    def column_op(a, b):
        if pd.api.types.is_scalar(b):
            if pd.isna(b):  # Handling NaT
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:  # b is a Series
            b = b.reindex(a.index)
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The modification involves checking if the right operand is a scalar, and if it is, handling the NaT case explicitly. If the right operand is a Series, it is properly aligned with the index of the left DataFrame before performing the operation.

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
