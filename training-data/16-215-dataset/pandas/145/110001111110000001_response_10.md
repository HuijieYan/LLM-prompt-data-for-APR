1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is meant to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation. It checks the type of `right` and then defines a `column_op` function based on the type of `right`. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values.

2. The potential error is within the `column_op` function that is defined based on the type of `right`. The specific implementation of the `column_op` function for the case involving a numpy array and "NaTType" (representing "Not a Time") is causing the error.

3. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for multiplication between a numpy array and 'NaTType'. The specific error occurs within the `masked_arith_op` function where it is attempting to perform the operation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the operands for multiplication are compatible and handle the case for 'NaTType' specifically.
   - Ensure that the `masked_arith_op` function handles the operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType' appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected code, the `column_op` function now properly handles the case when the `right` operand is a `TimedeltaIndex` which represents time differences, including the 'NaTType'. This should ensure that the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` passes successfully.
