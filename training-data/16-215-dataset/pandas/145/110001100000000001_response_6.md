1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. It calls the function `column_op` multiple times depending on the type of input, and then evaluates the result using `expressions.evaluate`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the different cases in the `if-elif` block where `column_op` is defined based on the type of input `right`.

3. The bug in the code likely stems from the inconsistent usage and definition of the `column_op` function within the different conditions in the `if-elif` block. The related functions `column_op` are not implemented correctly within the different conditions, and this inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during the function execution.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the `column_op` function in a single location and use it consistently throughout the different conditions based on the type of input `right`.
   - Update the code to ensure that `column_op` is implemented correctly for each condition, taking into account the specific type of input and the desired operation.

5. Corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function is defined using the input arguments `a` and `b` based on the type of the input `right`. This ensures consistent usage and correct implementation of `column_op` within the different conditions.
