The buggy function, `dispatch_to_series`, appears to be incorrectly handling the case where the input `right` is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and the `func` is a multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul>`).

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` aims to check the behavior of the DataFrame arithmetic when a DataFrame is multiplied by a Series containing `NaT` values of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The actual error occurs during the evaluation of the arithmetic operation within the function `dispatch_to_series`.

The problem seems to be related to how the function handles the Series input with `NaT` values when performing the arithmetic operation. The error message indicates that the function fails to handle the operand types for multiplication (`*`) when one of the operands is a `numpy.ndarray` and the other is a `NaTType`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the `NaT` values appropriately, ensuring that the arithmetic operation is performed correctly. One possible approach is to modify the handling of the `NaT` values within the function to avoid the `TypeError` encountered during the evaluation of the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.common import is_scalar
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(right.dtype) and func.__name__ == '__mul__':
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: x * right)
        return new_data
    else:
        # handle other cases
        return expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
```

This corrected function includes a specific conditional branch to handle the case where the input `right` is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and the operation is multiplication (`__mul__`). This branch applies the operation directly to the DataFrame using the `apply` method, which should handle `NaT` values appropriately.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable criteria.
