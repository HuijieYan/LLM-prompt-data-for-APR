The issue in the buggy function is that the variable `right` is being converted to a numpy array before the operations are completed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` functions so that they correctly handle the different types of input for the `right` parameter. We also need to make sure that the final `new_data` is constructed correctly based on the type of `right`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.indexing import check_bool_indexer

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = {col: func(left[col], right) for col in left.columns}
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = {col: func(left[col], right[col]) for col in left.columns}
    else:
        new_data = {col: func(left[col], right) for col in left.columns}

    return pd.DataFrame(new_data)
```

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
