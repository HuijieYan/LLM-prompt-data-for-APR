The issue with the current implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the right input is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The function needs to correctly dispatch the operation to the Series implementation for this case, which it currently does not.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is failing because of an unsupported operand type error during a multiplication operation. The function is not handling the `timedelta64[ns]` type correctly, resulting in the error.

To fix this issue, the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to correctly handle the case when the right input is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. This can be done by modifying the function to dispatch the operation to the Series implementation based on the type of the right input.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    from pandas.core.ops import is_scalar, notna, _bool_arith_check

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the multiplication operation with a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` and resolve the error in the failing test.
