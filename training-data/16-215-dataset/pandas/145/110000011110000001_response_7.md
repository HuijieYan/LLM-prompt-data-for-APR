1. The buggy function, `dispatch_to_series`, seems to be failing when trying to evaluate the expression `df * ser` in the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`. The error message indicates that the operation `*` is being evaluated on arrays with a `NaT` (Not a Time) type, leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This suggests that the code is not handling the `NaT` values in a way that allows the operation to be performed successfully.

2. The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is the implementation of the `column_op` function, which is used to perform the operation on the columns of the DataFrame when the right operand is a scalar or another DataFrame.

3. The bug is caused due to the inability of the code to handle the `NaT` type effectively when performing the operation between the DataFrame and Series. The code fails to handle the `NaT` values and does not provide a proper mechanism to perform the operation with such values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Explicitly check for and handle `NaT` values within the `column_op` function when performing the operation on the DataFrame and the Series.
   - Use conditional statements to handle the cases where the right operand is a `NaT` type, ensuring that the operation is performed in a way that is compatible with `NaT` values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(b.dtype):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With the changes in the `column_op` function, it should now handle the `NaT` values, allowing the operation to be performed successfully. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
