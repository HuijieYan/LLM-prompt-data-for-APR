The bug is likely related to the interaction between the `func` parameter (which is either an arithmetic or comparison operator) and the `right` parameter, which can be a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for the multiplication operation when one of the operands is a numpy.ndarray and the other is a NaTType.

The issue seems to be occurring within the `masked_arith_op` function, where there is an unsupported operand type(s) for the multiplication operation when one of the operands is a numpy.ndarray and the other is a NaTType.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `masked_arith_op` function to handle the case where `y` is a NaTType and the operation is multiplication.

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if axis not in [None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for axis")

    def mask_and_calculate(x, y, op):
        xrav = x.ravel()
        mask = ~pd.isna(xrav) & ~pd.isna(y)
        result = np.empty(x.size, dtype=x.dtype)
        with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
            result[mask] = op(xrav[mask], y)
        return result.reshape(x.shape)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [None, 1, "columns"]:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: mask_and_calculate(a, b.values, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [0, "index"]:
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: mask_and_calculate(a, np.broadcast_to(b.values, (len(a), len(b))), func)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this modified version of the function:
1. We added a new `mask_and_calculate` function to handle the case where one operand is a NaTType.
2. We replaced the original `column_op` functions with lambda functions that utilize the `mask_and_calculate` function when appropriate.
3. We added additional conditions to handle the different cases for the `right` parameter and the `axis` parameter.

This corrected function should now handle the case where the right operand is a NaTType and the operation is multiplication, and it should pass the failing test provided.
