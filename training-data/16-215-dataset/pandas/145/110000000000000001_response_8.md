1. The buggy function "dispatch_to_series" is designed to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes in a DataFrame, a scalar or another DataFrame, an arithmetic or comparison operator, as well as optional string representation and axis parameters. However, the function is not working correctly due to potential errors in the conditional logic and implementation of the column_op function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic that checks the type of the "right" parameter and determines the appropriate column_op function to use.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional logic and the implementation of the column_op function may not be handling all the different cases correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Adjust the conditional logic to correctly identify the type of the "right" parameter and choose the appropriate column_op function.
   b. Ensure that the column_op function is implemented correctly for each case to perform the desired operation column-by-column.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        if right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]), axis=1)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Incompatible DataFrame shapes")
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we have simplified the conditional logic and used the apply function along with lambda expressions to apply the specified function "func" to the DataFrame "left" column-by-column, based on the type of the "right" parameter. We have also added checks for DataFrame compatibility and raised a ValueError for incompatible shapes. This should address the issues with the original buggy function and provide the expected behavior.
