The issue in the buggy function is that it is incorrectly handling the case where the 'right' input is a Series and 'axis' is set to 'columns'. This is resulting in the 'b' variable being treated as an ndarray instead of a Series, causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'column_op' function to properly handle the case where 'right' is a Series and 'axis' is set to 'columns'. We also need to ensure that the 'b' variable is correctly used as a Series in this case.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
from pandas.core import common as lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With these changes, the function will now correctly handle the case where 'right' is a Series and 'axis' is set to 'columns', and return the expected results.
