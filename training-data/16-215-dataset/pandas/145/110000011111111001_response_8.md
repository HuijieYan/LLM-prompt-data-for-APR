The buggy function is `dispatch_to_series` which is failing when `func` is the multiplication function and the right parameter is a Series containing timedelta64 and the `func` operator is "columns". The bug is likely in the `column_op` function implementation.

The error message indicates that the error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function tries to evaluate the multiplication operation. The issue arises from the fact that the multiplication operation is being performed between a numpy array and a NaTType, which is not supported.

To fix this issue, the `column_op` function should handle the case where the right parameter is a Series containing NaTType. It should only perform the multiplication operation if the right parameter is a scalar or another dataframe, and skip the operation if it is a Series containing NaT.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns" and not any(pd.isnull(right)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and not any(pd.isnull(right)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding conditions to check for the presence of NaT in the right parameter, we can ensure that the operation is only performed when it is safe to do so, avoiding the unsupported operand type error.
