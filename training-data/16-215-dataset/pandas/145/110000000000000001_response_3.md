1. The buggy function is designed to dispatch the operation `func(left, right)` to series implementation by evaluating column by column. It checks the type of `right` and then defines a column_op function to apply the operation to each column. The bug may be due to the incorrect implementation of the column_op function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `column_op` function, as this is where the operation is actually applied to the columns of the DataFrame.

3. The bug is likely caused by a potential issue in how the `column_op` function is defined, which might be responsible for an incorrect application of the operation to the DataFrame.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Checking the implementation of the `column_op` function to ensure it correctly applies the operation to the columns.
   b. Verifying the conditional statements for different types of `right` to ensure the appropriate operation is applied in each case.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
