The issue with the original function is that it is not handling the case when the right input is a scalar or Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype properly. Here's a corrected version of the function that handles this issue:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and (axis == "columns" or axis is None):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, I've used the `apply` method to apply the `func` to each column of the `left` DataFrame. If the `right` input is a Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype and `axis` is "columns" or None, it applies the function to each column using the Series as the second input. Otherwise, it applies the function to each column using the scalar value or DataFrame as the second input. This should handle the case where the original function was failing.
