The issue seems to stem from the fact that when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called, the `column_op` function should be defined only once depending on the type of the `right` parameter. However, it is being redefined multiple times based on different conditions, which is resulting in the wrong function being called at runtime. This is causing the TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation.

To fix this, we need to refactor the `dispatch_to_series` function to only define the `column_op` function once, based on the type of the `right` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this updated version of the function, the `column_op` function is defined based on the condition and type of the `right` parameter, ensuring that the correct implementation is used for the given scenario.
