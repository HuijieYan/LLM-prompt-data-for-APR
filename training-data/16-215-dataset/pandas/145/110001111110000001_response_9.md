The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is called when performing DataFrame arithmetic operations. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser`. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised due to unsupported operand types for multiplication: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The issue seems to be related to how the `column_op` function is used within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The `column_op` function is supposed to apply the arithmetic operation to each column of the DataFrame, but it appears to be incorrectly handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with the same index as the DataFrame.

To fix the bug:
1. Analyze the logic of conditional branches in the `dispatch_to_series` function to identify the potential location of the bug.
2. Review the implementation of `column_op` function for different conditional cases and ensure it correctly applies the arithmetic operation to DataFrame columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected code includes fixes to the `if-elif-else` branches to handle different cases of the `right` operand and calls the `column_op` appropriately for each case. The corrected implementation should resolve the issue identified in the failing test.
