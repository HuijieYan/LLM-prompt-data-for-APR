The issue with the `quantile` function is that it is failing to handle datetime data correctly when called on a DataFrame. The problem seems to be related to the `is_transposed` variable and the data transposition logic within the function. 

The error is likely occurring because the function fails to handle datetime data properly when it transposes the data. The `is_transposed` variable is being set to `False` even though the input is a DataFrame with datetime values. As a result, the transposition logic is not working as intended, leading to the ValueError when attempting to concatenate arrays.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle datetime data when transposing the DataFrame. This can be achieved by updating the logic for `is_transposed` and data transposition.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    is_datetime = self.dtypes.apply(lambda x: np.issubdtype(x, np.datetime64)).any()

    if is_datetime:
        data = self
        is_transposed = axis == 0  # Transpose the data for datetime values
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    
    return result
```

In this corrected code, the function first checks if the input DataFrame contains datetime values. If it does, it sets the `is_transposed` variable based on the `axis` parameter and transposes the data accordingly. This ensures that datetime data is handled correctly when calculating the quantile.

This correction should resolve the issue with the `quantile` function not handling datetime data properly and should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
