The issue in the buggy function is that when the input dataframe does not have any numeric columns, the data is being dropped and an empty DataFrame is created, leading to a ValueError when attempting to concatenate the empty arrays.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the implementation of the `quantile` function to handle cases where the input dataframe does not have any numeric columns.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not numeric_only:
        data = self
    else:
        # Filter columns to only include numeric types
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        # If there are no numeric columns, return an empty DataFrame or Series based on input q
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            result = pd.Series([], name=q, dtype='float64')
        else:
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[], dtype='float64')
    else:
        # Compute quantile from the numeric data
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected implementation, the function checks if `numeric_only` is set to False. If it is, the DataFrame will be used as is without filtering out non-numeric columns. Otherwise, the function filters columns to only include numeric types. The function also checks for the case when the resulting `data` DataFrame is empty and creates an empty DataFrame or Series based on the input `q`. This ensures that the function does not attempt to compute quantiles on empty data, resolving the ValueError that was occurring in the failing test.

After making these changes, the `quantile` function should behave as expected and pass the failing test.
