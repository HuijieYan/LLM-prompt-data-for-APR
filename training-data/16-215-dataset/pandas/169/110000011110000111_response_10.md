The bug is likely located in the `data._data.quantile` part of the `quantile` function. The error message indicates a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate". This suggests that there is an issue with concatenating the data when the DataFrame contains date or timedelta data.

The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` demonstrates the problem by creating a DataFrame with date data and attempting to calculate the quantile, leading to the ValueError.

The GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" also confirms that there is an issue with DataFrame quantile calculation when it involves datetime data, and the expected output is that the DataFrame should return the result just as Series does.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the conditional statement `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` to ensure that date and timedelta data are also included in the calculation.

The corrected code for the `quantile` function is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Include both numeric and date or timedelta data
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self._get_numeric_data().append(self.select_dtypes(include=['datetime', 'timedelta']))

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this correction, the `quantile` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
