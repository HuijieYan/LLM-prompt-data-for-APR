The error occurs in the `quantile` method of the DataFrame class. The `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error message suggests that there are no arrays to concatenate, which is likely caused by the `data._data.quantile` method call.

Upon analysis of the code, it seems that the line `result = self._constructor(result)` inside the `quantile` method is causing the issue. This line is supposed to construct a DataFrame from the `result` array, but it is not handling the edge case when there are no arrays to concatenate, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix this, we can modify the `result` construction logic to handle the edge case when `result` is empty. In this case, we should return an empty DataFrame or Series depending on the input `q`. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct result type (DataFrame or Series) is returned based on the input `q`.

Below is the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    # ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this modification, the `quantile` method should now handle the edge case of an empty result correctly, and the failing test should pass.
