1. The buggy function is a method within the DataFrame class in the pandas library. It is responsible for calculating the quantile of the DataFrame. This function calls the _check_percentile method and the _get_numeric_data method from the same class, and it also calls the _constructor and _constructor_sliced methods.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of the quantile, specifically in the result assignment.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of the quantile calculation and the processing of the result. The _check_percentile method might not be validating the input 'q' correctly, and the _get_numeric_data method might not be retrieving the correct data for numeric calculations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the _check_percentile method properly validates the input 'q'
   - Verifying that the _get_numeric_data method retrieves the correct data for numeric calculations
   - Double-checking the result assignment and the usage of the _constructor and _constructor_sliced methods

5. Corrected code:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, I have simplified the function by directly calling the quantile method on the data, passing the required parameters. Removing unnecessary method calls and simplifying the code can help in avoiding potential bugs and improving code readability.
