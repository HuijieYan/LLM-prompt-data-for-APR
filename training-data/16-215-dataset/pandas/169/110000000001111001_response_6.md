The issue with the buggy function is that it's incorrectly handling the input parameters and not returning the expected output. The function is supposed to calculate the quantile over the requested axis, but it is failing to do so.

The problem lies in the logic of how the "data" variable is being assigned based on the "numeric_only" parameter. It is also incorrectly handling transposed data.

To fix the bug, the "get_numeric_data()" method should be used to filter the numeric data based on the "numeric_only" parameter. Additionally, the transposed data should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with handling the numeric data and transposed data, and it correctly calculates the quantile over the requested axis.
