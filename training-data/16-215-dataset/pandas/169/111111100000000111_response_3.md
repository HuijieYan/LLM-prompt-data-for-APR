1. The buggy function is the quantile function within the DataFrame class in the pandas library. It is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The function is related to the _constructor function and the _check_percentile function within the same class. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using datetimes, the DataFrame quantile function raises a ValueError, while the equivalent method with a Series works fine.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the implementation of the quantile calculation when dealing with datetime data.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is supposed to handle the calculation of quantiles for datetime data but seems to be encountering issues in the concatenation of the data.
   (b). The DataFrame class and related functions within pandas appear to be handling the quantile calculation and data manipulation, but there seems to be a specific issue when dealing with datetime data.
   (c). The GitHub Issue information confirms that the bug occurs when using datetimes, indicating that the issue is isolated to that data type and its handling within the quantile function.
   (d). The code provided in the GitHub issue details the specific ValueError encountered when using the quantile function with datetime data, indicating that there is an issue with concatenation of the data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the code within the quantile function, especially the part that handles datetime data, and identify any potential issues that could cause a ValueError.
   - Check for any inconsistencies in the handling of datetime data within the function, and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior for calculating quantiles.
   - Verify if there are specific cases in which datetime data causes unexpected behavior, and adjust the function to handle these cases appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handle datetime data by converting it to numerical representation for quantile calculation
    if data._is_homogeneous_type("datetime64"):
        data = data.to_numeric()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, a check is added to handle datetime data specifically by converting it to a numerical representation for quantile calculation. This addresses the issue when using the quantile function with datetime data, as reported in the GitHub issue.
