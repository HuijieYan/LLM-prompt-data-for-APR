1. The buggy function is a method called quantile within a class that seems to be a part of a larger library (possibly pandas). The method is supposed to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The GitHub issue indicates that when using the quantile method with a DataFrame containing datetime data, it raises a ValueError, while the quantile method works fine with a Series containing datetime data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that checks for numeric_only and retrieves the data accordingly. It seems that when the method is applied to a DataFrame with datetime data, the logic might be failing to handle the datetime data properly, leading to the ValueError.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to how the method handles the different types of data within the DataFrame. When the method is applied to a Series, it works fine, but when applied to a DataFrame, it fails to handle datetime data properly, leading to a ValueError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic for handling datetime data and ensure that it is properly accounted for when calculating the quantile for a DataFrame.
   - Modify the logic to handle different data types within the DataFrame correctly, including datetime data.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as the original function)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    (same as the original function)

    Examples
    --------
    ... (same as the original function)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and not self._is_datetimelike else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we have added an additional check for `self._is_datetimelike` to determine whether the DataFrame contains datetime data. Based on this check, the data is handled accordingly when calculating the quantile, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
