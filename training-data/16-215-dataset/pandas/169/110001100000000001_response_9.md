1. The buggy function is a method for calculating quantiles in a pandas DataFrame. It calls the `_check_percentile` method to validate the input, and then calculates the quantiles using the `_get_numeric_data` method, before finally returning the result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of the quantiles using the `data._data.quantile` method. It is possible that the bug lies in how the quantiles are calculated and then returned.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the improper calculation or handling of the quantiles within the `data._data.quantile` method.

4. To fix the bug, the calculation and handling of the quantiles within the `data._data.quantile` method needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially revised. Also, it may be necessary to ensure that the inputs to the function are properly validated and converted to the right format before conducting the calculations.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    [Same as before... provide all the documentation]

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected code calls the `quantile` method of the DataFrame to calculate the quantiles, passing the necessary parameters. This simplifies the calculation process and reduces the chances of bugs. The result is then directly returned without any further manipulation.
