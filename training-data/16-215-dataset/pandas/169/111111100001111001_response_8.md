The buggy function `quantile` in the class `DataFrame` is not functioning correctly. It is supposed to calculate the quantiles of the input data along a specified axis, based on the given parameters. However, the actual implementation of the function does not produce the expected output. The function incorrectly processes the input data, resulting in empty DataFrames and incorrect values in certain variables.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the computation of the quantiles, specifically in the logic that handles the transposition of the input data. This is indicated by the presence of empty DataFrames and incorrect index and column values.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the transposed data. The function appears to transpose the data but does not handle the subsequent operations correctly, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the logic for transposing the data and computing the quantiles should be carefully reviewed and revised to ensure that the transposed data is processed correctly. Additionally, the handling of index and column values should be checked to ensure that they are maintained properly throughout the computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    is_series = False

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    else:
        is_series = True
        result = data._data.quantile(
            q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
        )
        
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if axis == 1 and not is_series:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the quantile computation logic is revised to handle both array-like and single quantile values appropriately. The transposition of the result is also adjusted based on the axis and the type of result. This should address the issues with the previous implementation and produce the expected output based on the provided input parameters.
