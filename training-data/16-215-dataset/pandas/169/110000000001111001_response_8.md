Based on the input/output information provided, it seems that the `data` variable is not being correctly initialized for the `quantile` function. This is likely the cause of the issue, as it is preventing the function from performing the intended computations.

To fix this bug, the `data` variable should be initialized with the correct data from the input `self` DataFrame using the `_get_numeric_data()` method. Additionally, the condition for transposing the data should also be adjusted based on the `axis` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self.copy()
    if axis == 1 or axis == 'columns':
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with initializing the `data` variable and transposing the DataFrame based on the `axis` parameter. It should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
