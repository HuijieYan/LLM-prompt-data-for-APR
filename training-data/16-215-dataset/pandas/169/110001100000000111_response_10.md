The buggy function is `quantile` which is defined within the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The issue appears to be related to the quantile computation for datetime data within a DataFrame. The GitHub issue suggests that the quantile computation for datetime data raises a `ValueError`, while it works fine with Series data.

The potential error location within the `quantile` function is likely with the computation of quantiles for datetime data, specifically when the DataFrame is used.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the `quantile` function not handling datetime data properly within the DataFrame. This is evident from the error message `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function should be modified to handle datetime data within the DataFrame. Specifically, the computation of quantiles for datetime data should be checked and handled appropriately within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    ... (the rest of the docstring remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    ... (the return part remains the same)

    Examples
    --------
    ... (the examples remain the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Check for datetime data and handle differently
    if isinstance(self.iloc[0, 0], pd.Timestamp):
        if isinstance(q, float):
            result = self._constructor(
                {col: data.quantile(q) for col, data in self.items()}
            )
        else:
            # If q is an array, compute quantiles for each value in q
            result = self._constructor(
                {quant: {col: data.quantile(quant) for col, data in self.items()} for quant in q}
            )
        
        return result
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to handle the case when the data includes datetime. If the data includes datetime, the quantile computation is handled differently, and the result is returned accordingly. This approach addresses the bug and ensures that the `quantile` function works correctly for both Series and DataFrame, including datetime data.
