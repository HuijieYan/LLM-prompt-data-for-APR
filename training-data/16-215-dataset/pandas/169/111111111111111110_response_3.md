The issue here is that the `_constructor` and `quantile` methods are being defined twice within the `DataFrame` class. This is causing confusion and failing the tests.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the redundant definitions of the `_constructor` and `quantile` methods from the `DataFrame` class. After removing the redundant definitions, the corrected version of the `DataFrame` class should look like this:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    """
    Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data
    structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations
    align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like
    container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure.
    
    ... (other class documentation)

    """
    # ... (other codes, a lot of methods and variables)

    # this is the fixed quantile function
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
        
        (other function documentation)
        
        """
        self._check_percentile(q)

        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result

```

After updating the `DataFrame` class, the buggy function should be fixed and the failing tests should pass as expected.
