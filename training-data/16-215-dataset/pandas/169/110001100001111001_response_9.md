The buggy function is the quantile function in the pandas/core/frame.py file. The function is designed to return the values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug is likely in the calculation of the result variable, as indicated by the unexpected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return in both cases. The data and data._data variables are both empty, which suggests an issue with the calculation of the quantile.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the result variable should be reviewed, specifically the use of the data and data._data variables. It seems that these variables are not being populated correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
    return result
```

This corrected function uses the pandas built-in quantile function to calculate the desired result based on the input parameters. It eliminates the need to manually calculate the quantile, which was likely the source of the bug.
