Looking at the buggy function and the failing test, as well as the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems like the issue is related to how the function handles datetime data. The error message indicates that there is a problem with concatenating the data. The failing test also shows that the DataFrame should return as Series does, but it is not doing so.

The potential error location within the problematic function lies in the `quantile` method where the `result` is being assigned after computation. It appears that the error may be related to how the function handles datetime data, as indicated by the failing test and the error message. It is likely that the function is not properly handling the datetime data, leading to an error during computation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking how datetime data is handled within the function, and ensuring that it is properly accommodated in the computation of the quantile.
2. Ensuring that the concatenation of the data is handled correctly, especially for datetime data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q))
    else:
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q), axis=axis)

    if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code will handle the quantile computation for both single quantiles and multiple quantiles in the case of a DataFrame, and it ensures that datetime data is properly handled in the computation. This should fix the bug and allow the function to return the expected results as mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
