The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `quantile` function where the `data` variable is being incorrectly assigned and manipulated. It seems like the function is not handling datetime data properly, leading to the error.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, which suggests that the `data` variable is not being handled correctly for datetime data.

The GitHub issue also mentions that the DataFrame should return just as a Series does, indicating that the function is not behaving consistently with different data types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling datetime data in the `quantile` function to ensure it is being properly processed.
2. Ensure that the function handles both Series and DataFrame consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (same as original)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    (same as original)

    Examples
    --------
    (same as original)
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    if not numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number, np.datetime64])

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected code handles datetime data properly by using `select_dtypes` to include numeric and datetime types for the `data` variable. It also simplifies the handling of transposed data, ensuring consistent behavior between Series and DataFrame. With these changes, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
