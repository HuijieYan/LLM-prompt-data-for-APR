1. The buggy function `quantile` is a method of the `DataFrame` class. This method is used to calculate the quantiles of the data in the dataframe. The potential error location within the problematic function is within the `result` calculation and the handling of the transposed data.

2. The bug's cause is associated with the incorrect handling of the transposed data within the `quantile` function.

3. The potential cause for the bug is within the `result` calculation where the transposed data is handled. The `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` functions are called to construct a new dataframe which might be causing the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the transposed data is correctly handled in the calculation of `result`.
   - Verify the usage of `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` functions to ensure they are used correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `quantile` method directly calls the `quantile` function on the `data` instead of calling `_data.quantile()`. This allows for a more straightforward calculation of the quantiles and simplifies the method.
