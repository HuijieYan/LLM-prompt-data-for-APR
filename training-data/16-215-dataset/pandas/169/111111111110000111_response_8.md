The issue here is that the DataFrame quantile method is not handling datetime data properly, leading to a ValueError when trying to concatenate arrays.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the way the DataFrame quantile method is handling datetime data in the _get_numeric_data() function. When the quantile method tries to concatenate the arrays, it doesn't recognize the datetime data as an array, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the quantile method in the DataFrame class needs to properly handle datetime and timedelta data when computing the quantiles.

Here's the corrected code for the quantile method in the DataFrame class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (same docstring as before) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(data, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number, np.datetime64])

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code checks if the data is an instance of DataFrame or Series and selects only the columns of numeric and datetime data types using the select_dtypes() method. This ensures that only the numeric and datetime values are used to compute the quantile, preventing the ValueError from occurring.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. This fix will also ensure that the DataFrame quantile method properly handles datetime data just like the Series quantile method.
