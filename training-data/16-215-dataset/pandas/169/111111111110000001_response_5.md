The error seems to be related to the `quantile` function within the `DataFrame` class of the pandas package. The failing test is related to quantile calculations and shows that there is a failure when trying to compute the 0.5 quantile on an empty DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the following segment:
```python
if result.ndim == 2:
    result = self._constructor(result)
else:
    result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```
It appears that the `result` may be empty, causing `result.ndim` to be 0, and therefore leading to an issue when trying to create the DataFrame. The error message related to concatenating arrays supports this hypothesis.

To fix the bug, an additional check for the empty result should be added. If the result is empty, an empty DataFrame or Series should be returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    ...
    # existing code

    if result.ndim == 2 and not result.empty:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = pd.DataFrame() if result.ndim == 2 else pd.Series([], name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this change, the `quantile` function should now properly handle the case of an empty result and pass the failing test.
