Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to be related to the `_concat_compat` function in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file. This suggests that the issue may be with the concatenation of the data when `values` is being computed.

Bug's cause:
The issue seems to be related to the quantile operation for datetime data in a DataFrame, where the function is not handling the data as expected. This is causing an error related to concatenation when trying to compute the `values`.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the quantile function handles datetime data appropriately.
2. Check the concatenation process for numeric and non-numeric data to avoid any issues with empty arrays during concatenation.
3. Review the process for handling the transposition of data to ensure it is done correctly when quantile computation is being performed.

Updated code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code aims to handle the quantile operation for datetime data in DataFrame appropriately and prevent the issue related to concatenation when computing the `values`.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the DataFrame should return as expected, resolving the GitHub issue.
