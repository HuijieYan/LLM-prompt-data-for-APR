The error is related to the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class from the pandas library. 

Looking at the error message, it seems that the `quantile` method is trying to concatenate empty arrays, which is causing a `ValueError`. This is likely due to the underlying `concat_compat` function being called with an empty array.

To fix this issue, the problem seems to be with how the `result` is being constructed in the `quantile` method. It is possible that the `data._data` attribute is empty, which is leading to empty arrays being passed to the `concat_compat` function.

One possible approach to fixing this is to add a check to handle the case where `data._data` is empty and return an empty result accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor()  # return an empty DataFrame if data is empty

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty `data`, we can return an empty DataFrame if needed, which should resolve the ValueError. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
