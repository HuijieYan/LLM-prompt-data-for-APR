1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This method is used to calculate the quantile values over a specified axis in the DataFrame. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is calling the quantile method with a DataFrame containing datetime values, and the test is failing with a ValueError indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation and manipulation of the `data` and `result` variables within the `quantile` method. It seems that the issue might be related to handling datetime values and managing the concatenation of resulting arrays.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to a mishandling of datetime values when calculating the quantile, which leads to an error when attempting to concatenate arrays.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring proper handling of datetime values in the quantile calculation.
   - Addressing the concatenation issue when dealing with datetime values.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- The `quantile` method calls the `quantile` method on the `data` directly, passing the `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation` arguments.
- The result is then processed and returned as before, ensuring proper handling of datetime values.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
