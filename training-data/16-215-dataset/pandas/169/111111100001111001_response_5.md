The issue with the buggy function is that it is attempting to access the `_data` attribute of the `data` variable, but it seems that the `data` variable is an empty DataFrame and does not have a `_data` attribute. This is likely causing the function to fail when trying to return the `result`. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `data` variable contains the necessary data before attempting to access its `_data` attribute. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `q` is a list, as in Case 2.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
        q = [q]

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = result.T
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `q` is a single value or a list, and convert it to a list if it's not already. Then, we proceed with the quantile calculation using the `data.quantile` method directly, which handles both the single `q` value and the list of quantiles. We also remove the unnecessary details from the function's docstring to keep it concise and clear.
