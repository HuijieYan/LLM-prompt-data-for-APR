The buggy function in the provided code is `quantile`. The error message from the failing test is `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This indicates that the function does not have an array to concatenate, which means that the `data` is empty or not being handled properly.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be in the `quantile` function's implementation. The error occurs when trying to concatenate 'values' from blocks in the quantile function. This indicates that the dataframe 'data' in the function might not be populated with data that leads to empty arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input data is being handled correctly, especially when the input dataframe is empty. We should also handle the case when the dataframe has no columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self.empty:
        # Handle the case when the dataframe is empty
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            result = pd.Series([], index=self.columns)
        return result

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the case when the dataframe is empty or has no columns, and it should pass the failing test.
