The problem with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the input data and its transformation before calculating the quantile. This results in an empty DataFrame being returned in both cases, which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it checks if `is_transposed` is True and then transposes the data. It seems that this logic is incorrect and is causing the empty DataFrame to be returned.

The bug's cause lies in the incorrect handling of the 'is_transposed' variable, which leads to incorrect data manipulation and ultimately an empty DataFrame being returned.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking and transposing the data based on 'is_transposed' needs to be corrected so that the data is handled properly before calculating the quantile.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    (Remaining function documentation remains unchanged...)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation
    )
    
    return result
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the input data and calculate the quantile, returning the correct result based on the input parameters.
