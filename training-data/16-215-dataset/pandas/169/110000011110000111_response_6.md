The issue here seems to be that when the DataFrame contains datetime data, the `quantile` function is failing with a `ValueError` related to concatenating arrays.

Looking at the failing test and error message, it seems that when `quantile(0.5)` is called on a DataFrame containing datetime data, the function fails due to an issue with concatenating arrays.

The GitHub issue title "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" and its detailed description provide a clear summary of the problem. It shows that the `quantile` method is not working as expected with datetime data, which is causing a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the `quantile` function needs to handle datetime data properly and avoid the `ValueError` related to concatenating arrays. One way to do this is to explicitly convert datetime data to numeric data before calculating the quantile.

Below is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (existing docstring)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore')

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=self.columns, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the `quantile` function should now handle datetime data properly and avoid the `ValueError` related to concatenating arrays.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the `quantile` function works as expected with both numeric and datetime data.
