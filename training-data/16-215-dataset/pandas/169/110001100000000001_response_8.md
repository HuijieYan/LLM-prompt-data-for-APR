1. The buggy function is a method within the pandas library's DataFrame class, allowing users to calculate the quantile of the data in the dataframe. The function calls the `_check_percentile` method to validate the input percentile value, then retrieves the numeric data from the dataframe using the `_get_numeric_data` method, and finally calculates the quantile using the `quantile` method from the dataframe's internal data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation of the quantile using the `result` variable and the subsequent conditional statements for handling the result.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional statements for checking the dimension of the result and handling it accordingly, which may not be properly handling the different types of results returned from the quantile calculation. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the conditional statements for handling the result are robust enough to handle different types of results returned from the quantile calculation. Additionally, the handling of transposed data should also be carefully considered to ensure the correct manipulation of the result.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    (Parameters, See Also, and Examples remain unchanged)

    """
    # Validate the input percentile value
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Retrieve the numeric data from the dataframe
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    # Get the axis number
    axis_number = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    is_transposed = axis_number == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Calculate the quantile
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis_number, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of the quantile has been simplified by directly using the `quantile` method of the dataframe's data, and the handling of transposed data has been made consistent. This should address the potential errors and provide the expected behavior for the quantile calculation.
