The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` variable as `None`. This causes the TypeError when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None` in the `prune` method.

The bug's cause is that `last_active` is initialized as `None`, and when the `prune` method tries to use it in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`, it throws a TypeError because it cannot add `None` and `int` together.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current timestamp if it is not provided. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # prune the worker
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable is initialized with the current timestamp if it is not provided, resolving the TypeError issue. The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
