The potential error in the function lies in the initialization of the `self.started` variable. It is currently being set to the current time using `time.time()`, which means it will always have a different value at each function call. This causes it to not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, we can remove the initialization of `self.started` from the `__init__` method and set it when the class is instantiated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = None  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

        self.set_started()

    def set_started(self):
        if self.started is None:
            self.started = time.time()
```

With this correction, the `self.started` variable will be set to the current time only if it has not been set previously. This ensures that it will match the expected value in the failing test case.
