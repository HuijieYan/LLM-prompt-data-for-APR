Potential Error:
The issue in the buggy function is that it is not importing the `time` module, which is used for `time.time()`.

Bug Cause:
The function is using `time.time()` without importing the `time` module, so it is currently throwing an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the import statement for the `time` module, the corrected code ensures that the `time.time()` function can be used without any issues, and the functionality of the function is maintained as expected.
