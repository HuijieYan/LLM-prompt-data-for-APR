The error message indicates that the code is trying to add an integer to a NoneType object which is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location is in the `__init__` function of the Worker class. It initializes the `last_active` attribute as None, and then in the `prune` function, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to `self.last_active`, which is None.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as None in the `__init__` function of the Worker class. When the `prune` function is called, it tries to add the worker disconnect delay to `self.last_active`, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should initialize `last_active` to the current time in the `__init__` function if it is not provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer, and the addition in the `prune` function will work as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always an integer. This code should pass the failing test.
