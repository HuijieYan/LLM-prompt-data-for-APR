```python
import time

class Worker:
    # fix the __init__ function to set last_active to 0 if it is None
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        # set last_active to 0 if it is None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    # other methods can remain the same
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # your prune logic here
```
This fixes the issue by setting last_active to 0 if it is None, ensuring that it can be added to an integer during the prune method.
