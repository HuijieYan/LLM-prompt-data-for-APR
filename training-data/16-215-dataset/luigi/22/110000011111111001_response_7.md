The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and the `last_active` variable is being used without checking for this condition. This leads to a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called because the `last_active` is `None` and it is being added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check in the `prune` method to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None`. We can do this by checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

And the corrected `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # delete worker
```

With these changes, the `prune` method will first check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition, which should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
