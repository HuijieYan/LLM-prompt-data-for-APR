1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. The function initializes the Worker object with the worker_id and last_active time. The failing test is trying to create a Worker object and prune it, but the prune method in the Worker class is expecting the last_active attribute to be a valid DateTime object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of last_active as None by default.

3. (a). The buggy function: The __init__ method initializes the Worker object with last_active assigned as None.
   (b). The buggy class: The Worker class has a prune method that expects the last_active attribute to be a valid DateTime object.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test calls the prune method on a Worker object, but since the last_active attribute is None, it raises a TypeError when trying to compare it with an integer.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check if last_active is None in the prune method before comparing it with time.time().
   b. Initialize last_active with a valid DateTime object in the __init__ method of the Worker class.

5. Corrected code for the __init__ method of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not given
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the corrected code, the last_active attribute is initialized with the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid DateTime object. This should fix the TypeError when calling the prune method in the failing test.
