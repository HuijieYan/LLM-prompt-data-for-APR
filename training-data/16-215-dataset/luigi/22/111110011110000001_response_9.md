1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create a new `Worker` instance and then call the `prune` method on it. The failing test is throwing a TypeError due to the `last_active` attribute being set to None and then trying to perform addition on it.

2. The potential error location is in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

3. The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized as None in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes a TypeError when trying to add an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to a NoneType.

4. To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with a default value or handle the case where it is None in the `prune` method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, when a `Worker` instance is created without explicitly passing a `last_active`, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

This corrected code should pass the failing test.
