## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The `Worker` class is responsible for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is testing the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, which is failing with a `TypeError` because it is trying to add `NoneType` to an integer.

## Bug Location
The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the `last_active` parameter, which is set to `None` by default. This causes the `TypeError` when the `prune` method tries to add `None` to an integer.

## Bug Cause
The `last_active` parameter is initially set to `None`, and when the `prune` method tries to use it in a calculation, it causes a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Set a default value for `last_active` that is an integer representing the time since epoch.
2. Add a condition in the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.

## Corrected Code
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # handle the pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method. This code should pass the failing test.
