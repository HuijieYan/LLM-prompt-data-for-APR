The issue with the buggy code is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and an `int` type.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time  # Need to import time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is not provided, resolving the `TypeError` and ensuring that the function meets the expected input/output requirements.
