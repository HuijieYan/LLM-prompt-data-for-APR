The issue in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it sets `last_active` to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to compare it with an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this, `last_active` should be initialized using the value passed as an argument, and if no value is provided, it should default to 0.

The corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class can be updated as follows:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch or 0 if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` variable is initialized to 0 by default if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This should address the issue and ensure that the failing test case passes.
