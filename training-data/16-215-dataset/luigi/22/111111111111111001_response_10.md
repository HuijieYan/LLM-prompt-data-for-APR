The issue with the buggy function is that it's not handling the case when `last_active` is `None`. The failing test is trying to access `self.last_active` and add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, which is causing the `TypeError` since `self.last_active` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Some pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `prune` method will now handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if needed, thus resolving the `TypeError` in the failing test. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
