The original code is missing the import statement for the `time` module. Additionally, the `__init__` function should be inside a class.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This is the corrected code with the `time` module correctly imported and the `__init__` function inside the `Worker` class.
