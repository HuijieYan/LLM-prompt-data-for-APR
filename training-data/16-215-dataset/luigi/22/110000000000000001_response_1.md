1. The function seems to be the constructor for a class, but it is missing the class definition. It should be enclosed within a class.

2. The potential error location is the missing class definition, as well as the missing import for the time module.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly defined within a class and is missing the import for the time module.

4. To fix the bug, we need to:
   - Enclose the function within a class definition
   - Import the time module at the beginning of the script
   
5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
This code defines the Worker class with the corrected __init__ function.
