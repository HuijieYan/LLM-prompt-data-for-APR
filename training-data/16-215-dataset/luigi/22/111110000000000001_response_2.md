1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is responsible for initializing the class attributes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "self.started = time.time()". The function references the time module without importing it, which will cause an error.

3. The cause of the bug is that the time module is being referenced without being imported, leading to a NameError.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, it is good practice to use the current time as the default value for last_active if none is provided.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With these changes, the code should now work properly and initialize the Worker class attributes without any errors.
