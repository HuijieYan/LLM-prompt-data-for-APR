The issue with the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then used in the `prune` function without checking if it's `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` function.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

And the corrected `prune` function:

```python
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning
            pass
```

With these changes, the `prune` function checks if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
