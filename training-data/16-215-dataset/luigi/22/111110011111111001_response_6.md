The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is being assigned a default value of `None`, which is causing the TypeError in the failing test. The failing test is attempting to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, but since `self.last_active` is `None`, it is causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should initialize `self.last_active` to `0` in the `__init__` method if no value is provided. This will ensure that `self.last_active` is always of type `float` and can be used in arithmetic operations without causing a TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to 0 if no value is provided, and the TypeError in the failing test will be resolved.
