Potential error location: The `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` function call will result in an error.

Bug's cause:
The `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` function cannot be called without causing an error. This results in the `self.started` variable being assigned with an incorrect value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file to allow the use of the `time.time()` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time  # Add this line to import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
By importing the `time` module, we ensure that the `time.time()` function can be called without any errors, and the `self.started` variable will be assigned the correct value. This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
