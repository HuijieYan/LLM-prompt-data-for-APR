1. The problematic function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py`. The failing test is the `test_worker_prune_after_init` function in the `test/scheduler_test.py`. The error message is a `TypeError` indicating that the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, which is called by the failing test.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is the `last_active` parameter, which is set to `None`.

3. The bug's cause is that the `last_active` attribute is initially set to `None`, and when the `prune` method is called, the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` leads to a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an `int`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include initializing `last_active` to an appropriate default value in the `__init__` method, or handling the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Perform the pruning action
```

With the corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to `time.time()` if it is `None`, ensuring that the comparison in the `prune` method does not result in a `TypeError`. The corrected function should pass the failing test.
