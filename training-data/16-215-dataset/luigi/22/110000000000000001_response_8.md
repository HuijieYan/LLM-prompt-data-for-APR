1. The buggy function is an __init__ method in a class, which is meant to initialize the attributes of the class instance. However, it has an issue with the 'last_active' attribute.

2. The potential error is in the assignment of the 'last_active' attribute.

3. The bug is caused by the use of a mutable default argument (None) for the 'last_active' parameter. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the method is called without passing a value for 'last_active'.

4. To fix the bug, we can use a default value that is not mutable, such as a sentinel value that indicates no value was provided for 'last_active'.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else -1  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we check if the 'last_active' parameter is None, and if it is, we assign a sentinel value (-1 in this case) to indicate that no value was provided. This avoids the issue of using a mutable default argument for 'last_active'.
