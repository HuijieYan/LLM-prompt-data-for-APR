1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The failing test is trying to call the `prune` method of the `Worker` class after initializing the `Worker` object, and it's throwing a `TypeError` related to the addition of `NoneType` and `int`.

2. The issue lies in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. It is set as `None`, but then the `prune` method tries to add it with the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

3. The bug is caused because the `last_active` attribute is not properly initialized, and it results in a `NoneType` when used in the `prune` method, leading to the `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute properly in the `__init__` method to avoid it being `None` when used in the `prune` method.

5. The corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current time if it is set as `None`, and this will prevent the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method. This corrected code will pass the failing test.
