1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It is responsible for initializing the attributes of the `Worker` object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.started = time.time()`. This line is using the `time` module without importing it, which will result in a NameError.

3. The bug's cause is that the `time` module needs to be imported before it can be used. The `time` module is used to get the current time in seconds since the epoch, but it is not imported in the given code, causing a NameError.

4. To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the script. This can be done by adding `import time` at the top of the script.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The fixed __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
