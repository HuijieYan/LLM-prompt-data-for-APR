1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the Worker class object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time.time() function without importing the time module. This will cause a NameError when trying to access time.time().

3. The cause of the bug is that time.time() is being called without importing the time module, so the function is not found.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
