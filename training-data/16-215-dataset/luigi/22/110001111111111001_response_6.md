The bug in the `__init__` function is related to the `last_active` variable, which is set to `None` by default. This causes an issue when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` instance because it attempts to perform an operation with a `None` value.

To fix this issue, we can update the `__init__` function to set the `last_active` variable to the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable will default to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the `prune` method can be called without causing a `TypeError`.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and will pass the failing test.
