The main issue with the buggy function is that it is using the `time` module without importing it first. This causes the function to fail because it cannot find the `time` module to access the `time.time()` function.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file so that it can be accessed within the `Worker` class. Once the `time` module is imported, the function should work correctly and produce the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the `time` module imported at the beginning of the file, the function will now be able to correctly access the `time.time()` function and produce the expected output for the test cases.
