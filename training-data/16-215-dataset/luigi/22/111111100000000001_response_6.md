1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It initializes various attributes of the `Worker` object such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.started = time.time()`. This line uses the `time` module without importing it, which will result in a NameError.

3. The bug's cause is that the `time` module is not imported in the `scheduler.py` file. This causes the `time.time()` method to be undefined, resulting in an error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the `scheduler.py` file. This will make the `time.time()` method available for use within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Import the necessary module
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the `time` module imported at the beginning of the file, the `time.time()` method can now be used within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class without causing a NameError.
