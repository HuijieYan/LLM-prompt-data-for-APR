The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function can be `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to the config during the `prune` function. To fix this issue, we need to make sure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is not provided.

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass
```

This corrected code initializes `self.last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, preventing the TypeError during the `prune` function. This change will make the code pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
