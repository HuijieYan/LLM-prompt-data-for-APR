The issue here is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `None` to a `float`, causing a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to set a default value for `last_active` that is not `None`. We can use `0` as the default value, assuming that `last_active` should start at 0 if not provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to `0` if not provided, and the `prune` method should work as expected without causing a `TypeError`.
