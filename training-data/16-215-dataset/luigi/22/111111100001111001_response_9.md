The bug in the given code is that it is using the current time `time.time()` for the `started` variable instead of the provided `last_active` time. This causes a discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values.

To fix this bug, the `started` variable should be set to the value of `last_active` if it is provided, otherwise, it should be set to the current time.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `started` variable will be set to the provided `last_active` time if it is not None, otherwise, it will be set to the current time. This change will ensure that the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases.
