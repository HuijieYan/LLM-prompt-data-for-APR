1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is supposed to initialize the attributes of the Worker object, such as id, reference, last_active, started, tasks, and info. However, the function has not imported the necessary time module and is using the time.time() which will cause an error.

2. The potential error location is the line where time.time() is used without importing the time module.

3. The cause of the bug is that the time module is not imported, so time.time() cannot be used.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported within the class.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
import time # import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
