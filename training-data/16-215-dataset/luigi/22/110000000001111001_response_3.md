The problem with the buggy function is that it does not import the 'time' module, which results in a NameError for 'time'. Additionally, the default value for the 'last_active' parameter is not being used correctly. It should be set to None as specified, but it is instead being set to a float value.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 'time' module, and explicitly set the 'last_active' parameter to None. We will also need to make sure that the 'started' variable is assigned the correct value and remove any discrepancies in the output variable values.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class BuggyFunction:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
