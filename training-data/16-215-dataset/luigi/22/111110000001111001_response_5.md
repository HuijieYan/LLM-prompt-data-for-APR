Potential error location: The `time` module is not imported, but it is used to access the `time.time()` function. This would lead to a `NameError` when the code is executed.

Bug cause:
(a). Buggy function: The `time.time()` function is used to assign the value of `self.started`, but the `time` module is not imported.
(b). Buggy class: The class contains an instance variable `last_active` which is not manipulated within the function. It is used as an input but not assigned within the init method.
(c). Discrepancies: The `self.started` value is incorrect due to the missing import of the `time` module.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module to access `time.time()` function.
2. Remove the `last_active` parameter since it is unused within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module to access time.time()

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = None  # seconds since epoch, unused variable
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
Now, the init method only takes one parameter (worker_id) and removes the unnecessary `last_active` parameter. The `time` module has been imported to properly access `time.time()` and assign the value to `self.started`. The corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
