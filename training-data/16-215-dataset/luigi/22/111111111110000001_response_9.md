The potential error location within the buggy function is in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is set to `None`, and when the `prune` function is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` function is called and tries to compare `self.last_active` with `time.time()`, it throws a `TypeError` because it is attempting to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current time in case it is `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # prune the worker
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None` in the `__init__` function, the `TypeError` will be avoided, and the `prune` function should work correctly.
