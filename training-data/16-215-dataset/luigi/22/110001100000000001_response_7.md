1. The buggy function is the initialization method for a class in the file luigi/scheduler.py. It initializes various attributes of the class, including the worker_id, last_active, started time, tasks, and info.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the usage of the time module without importing it.

3. The bug is caused by the usage of the time module without importing it within the function. This leads to a NameError when trying to use time.time().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include importing the time module at the beginning of the file or using the fully qualified name for the time module within the function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module at the beginning of the file

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
