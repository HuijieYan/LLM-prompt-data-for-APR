The problem lies in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The issue is with the `last_active` parameter, which is set to `None` by default. When the `prune` method is called with a `config` object, it tries to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can set a default value of 0 for `last_active` if it is not provided when the `Worker` object is initialized.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function will default to 0 if not provided, ensuring that it is always an integer. This will fix the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method with a `config` object.
