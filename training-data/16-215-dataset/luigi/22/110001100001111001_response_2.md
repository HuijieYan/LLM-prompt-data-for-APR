The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not import the necessary time module for the time.time() function. This results in a NameError when trying to call time.time().

To fix this bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the file. Then, we can use the time.time() function to initialize the self.started variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly initialize the self.started variable, and the expected value and type of variables will match the actual values during the execution of the function.
