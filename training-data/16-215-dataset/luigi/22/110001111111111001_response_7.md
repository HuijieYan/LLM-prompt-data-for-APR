The bug in the `__init__` function is that it does not handle the default value for the `last_active` parameter. In the failing test, the `prune` method is trying to add a time value (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to `self.last_active`, but `self.last_active` is set to `None` by default, which causes a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should explicitly check if `last_active` is provided and set it to the current time if not.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it's not provided, and the `prune` method should work as expected.

This should ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and passes the failing test.
