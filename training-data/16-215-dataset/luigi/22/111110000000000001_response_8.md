1. The buggy function is the __init__ method within the class Worker. This method is used to initialize the object of the Worker class with the provided worker_id and last_active values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time.time() method without importing the time module. This will result in a NameError when trying to access the time module.

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is not imported, so the time.time() method cannot be used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the time module at the beginning of the file using "import time".
   - Use the time.time() method to initialize the self.started attribute.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The fixed __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the time module is imported at the beginning of the file, and the time.time() method is used to initialize the self.started attribute within the __init__ method of the Worker class.
