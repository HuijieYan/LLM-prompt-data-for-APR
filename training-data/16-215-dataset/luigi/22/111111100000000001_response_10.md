1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It initializes a Worker object with a worker_id and last_active time. However, it seems to be missing the import statement for the 'time' module.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of time.time() without importing the 'time' module.

3. The bug's cause is that the 'time' module is not imported in the buggy function, and so the call to time.time() will result in a NameError.

4. To fix the bug, the 'time' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file or inside the Worker class.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Import the required module
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
