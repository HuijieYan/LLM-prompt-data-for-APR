1. The buggy function is the __init__ function of the Worker class in the luigi.scheduler module. The failing test function is testing the prune method of the Worker class. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to add the last active time of a worker to the worker disconnect delay time.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the last_active attribute to a default value of None.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function initializes the last_active attribute to None, which causes a TypeError when trying to add it to an integer in the prune method.
   (b). The prune method checks if the last_active time of a worker plus the worker_disconnect_delay is less than the current time, indicating that the worker should be pruned.
   (c). The failing test is trying to call the prune method with a configuration object and is encountering a TypeError when trying to add None (last_active) to an integer (worker_disconnect_delay).

4. To fix the bug, the last_active attribute needs to be initialized with a default value that can be used in the prune method without causing a TypeError. One possible approach is to initialize last_active with the current time when it is not provided during initialization.

5. 
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations
            pass
```

With the updated __init__ function, the last_active attribute will be initialized with the current time if it is not provided during worker initialization. This will fix the TypeError encountered in the failing test and allow the prune method to work correctly.
