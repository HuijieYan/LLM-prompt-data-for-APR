1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the file `luigi/scheduler.py`. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` in the file `test/scheduler_test.py` is calling the `prune` method on a `Worker` object.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the line `self.last_active = last_active`, where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` if no value is provided.

3. The bug is caused by the `last_active` being set to `None` and then used in the `prune` method in conjunction with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` and `time.time()`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to compare `None` with an integer.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time if no value is provided. Additionally, the `prune` method should account for the possibility of `last_active` being `None`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None, set to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and set to the current time if it is. This ensures that the `prune` method can safely compare `last_active` with `time.time()`.
