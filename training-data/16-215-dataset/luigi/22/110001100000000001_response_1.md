1. The buggy function is the initializer for a class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. It takes two parameters, `worker_id` and `last_active`, and initializes several instance variables.

2. The potential error in the function is the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` and `started` variables. The `last_active` defaults to `None`, and the `started` variable is initialized using the `time` module without importing it.

3. The bug's cause is that the `last_active` variable should default to the current time if no value is provided, and the `time` module needs to be imported to use the `time.time()` function.

4. To fix the bug, the `last_active` variable should default to the current time if no value is provided, and the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
