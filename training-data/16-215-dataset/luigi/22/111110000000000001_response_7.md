1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is supposed to initialize the Worker object with the provided worker_id and last_active time, but there are a couple of issues with it.

2. The potential error location is in the initialization of the 'started' attribute with `time.time()` without the proper import of the time module.

3. The cause of the bug is that the time module is not imported in the class, so the call to `time.time()` will result in an error. Additionally, the last active time should default to the current time if it is not provided.

4. To fix the bug:
    a. Import the time module at the beginning of the file.
    b. Set the default value for last_active to None in the function signature.
    c. Set the 'started' attribute inside the __init__ method using `time.time()` after importing the time module.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import time  # import the time module at the beginning of the file

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else int(time.time())  # default to current time if not provided
        self.started = int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The corrected code includes the import of the time module at the beginning and uses it to set the 'last_active' and 'started' attributes in the __init__ method of the Worker class.
