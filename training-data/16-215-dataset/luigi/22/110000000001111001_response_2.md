The issue with the buggy function is that it is missing the import statement for the `time` module, which is used in the `time.time()` function. This is causing the function to raise an error and return incorrect values for the `self.started` variable.

To fix the bug, we need to add the import statement for the `time` module at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly set the `self.started` variable to the current time using the `time.time()` function, and the other variables will retain their expected values and types.
