1. The buggy function is an initializer method for a class, but it is missing the import statement for the time module.

2. The potential error location is the use of time.time() without importing the time module.

3. The cause of the bug is the missing import statement for the time module, which is necessary for using the time.time() function.

4. The bug can be fixed by adding the import statement for the time module at the beginning of the code.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With the import statement for the time module, the code should work as intended.
