The bug is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function and then being used in the `prune` function without first checking if it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when it's added to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix this bug, we can check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly before performing any operations with it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

And here's the corrected code for the `prune` function within the `Worker` class:

```python
def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # delete worker
```

This way, we first check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing any operations involving it. This should fix the `TypeError` and make the function pass the failing test.
