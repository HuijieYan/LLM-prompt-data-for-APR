Potential error location: The `time` module is used but never imported in the buggy code, which causes the `time.time()` function to fail.

Bug cause: The `time` module needs to be imported in order to use the `time.time()` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file using `import time`.
2. Use `time.time()` function to assign the value to the `self.started` variable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
