The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` in the `prune` method. The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType` which causes the `TypeError` when trying to add it with an integer.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to `None` by default, and the comparison in the `prune` method is expecting it to be an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is now initialized with the current time if it is not provided. This will prevent the `TypeError` when comparing it in the `prune` method. The corrected code should pass the failing test.
