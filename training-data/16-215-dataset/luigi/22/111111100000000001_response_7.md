1. The buggy function is the "__init__" function within the "Worker" class. This function is responsible for initializing the Worker object with the provided worker_id and last_active time, along with other attributes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the "time.time()" function without importing the "time" module, which will cause a NameError.

3. The bug's cause is a NameError due to the missing import of the "time" module, which leads to the "time.time()" function being undefined within the scope of the "__init__" function.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to import the "time" module at the beginning of the file to make the "time.time()" function available within the "__init__" function. Another approach could be to initialize the "started" attribute with a default value instead of using the "time.time()" function.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, the "time" module is imported at the beginning of the file, and the "started" attribute is initialized using the "time.time()" function if "last_active" is None, otherwise, it is initialized with the provided "last_active" value.
