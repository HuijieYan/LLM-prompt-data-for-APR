# The corrected version of the function
```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, I have added the necessary import statement for the 'time' module and specified the default value for 'last_active' to be the current time if it is not provided. Additionally, I have encapsulated the function within a class called Scheduler.
