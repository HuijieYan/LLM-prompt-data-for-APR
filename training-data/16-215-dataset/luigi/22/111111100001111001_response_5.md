Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the initialization of the 'self.started' variable. It is currently being set to 'time.time()' without importing the 'time' module, which causes the code to fail.

Bug's Cause:
(a) The buggy function is not importing the 'time' module, so calling 'time.time()' directly throws an error.
(b) This prevents the 'self.started' variable from being initialized with the current time.
(c) The discrepancy between the actual and expected 'self.started' value is due to this error.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the 'time' module at the beginning of the file to access the 'time.time()' function.
2. Update the buggy function to set 'self.started' using 'time.time()' to get the current time.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time  # import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With the above corrected code, the buggy function will now properly initialize the 'self.started' variable using the current time and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
