1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it, passing an instance of the `TmpCfg` class as an argument. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object to the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is the assignment of `last_active` to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when it is later used in the `prune` method.

3. (a) The `last_active` attribute is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.
   (b) The failing test is trying to use the `prune` method on a `Worker` object, and it is expecting the `last_active` attribute to be a number. However, since it is initialized to `None`, a `TypeError` is raised when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` before adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method. If `last_active` is `None`, then the condition should handle this case gracefully and not perform the addition.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is set to the current time if it is passed as `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

After applying the correction, the failing test should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
