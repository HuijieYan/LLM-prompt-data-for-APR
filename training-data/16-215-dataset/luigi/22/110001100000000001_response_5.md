1. The buggy function is a constructor for a class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. It initializes certain attributes for a worker object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect initialization of the last_active attribute. The default value is set to None, but it should be an integer representing seconds since epoch.

3. The bug's cause is that the last_active attribute is set to None by default, which can cause issues when trying to compare it with a timestamp. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using this attribute in related functions that rely on the last_active attribute to determine the status of a worker.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the last_active attribute always has a valid timestamp value, even if it is a default value. This can be achieved by setting the default value of last_active to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, the last_active attribute is set to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, ensuring that it always has a valid timestamp value. This will prevent potential issues when using this attribute in related functions.
