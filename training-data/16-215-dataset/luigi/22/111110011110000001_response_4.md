The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` variable is being initialized as `None`, but the `prune` method in the failing test is trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, which is resulting in a `TypeError` because we can't add an integer to `None`.

The potential error location is identified as the initialization of the `last_active` variable.

The bug's cause lies in the fact that `last_active` is being initialized as `None`, and then later on, the `prune` method is trying to add an integer to it, causing a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a valid value (either a default value or a value passed in during initialization) so that it can be used in arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform the necessary pruning action
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` variable is initialized to either the provided value or the current time if none is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method.
