The issue in the `__init__` method is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` in the `prune` method when trying to add `None` with an integer.

To fix this, we should provide a default value for `last_active` in case it's `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune operation
            pass
```

With the updated `__init__` method, the `last_active` parameter is checked to see if it's `None`, and if it is, it's assigned the current time using `time.time()` in order to prevent the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.
