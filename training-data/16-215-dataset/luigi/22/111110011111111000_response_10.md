```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected version, the `last_active` variable is assigned the value of `last_active` if it is not None, otherwise it is assigned the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `last_active` variable is always a valid float and prevents the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
