The bug in the given function is that `time.time()` is being called without importing the `time` module, which will lead to a `NameError` at runtime. This is because the `time` module is not found and as a result, `time.time()` is not defined.

To fix this bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the function will no longer throw a `NameError` and will be able to correctly initialize the `started` variable with the current time using `time.time()`. The function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
