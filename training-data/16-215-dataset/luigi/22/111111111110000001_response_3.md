The bug occurs in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` as a default value, and then in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to use `self.last_active` in a comparison without checking if it's `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can do this by adding a check to see if `last_active` is `None` and if so, skipping the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Delete the worker
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `prune` method will check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison, thus avoiding the `TypeError` seen in the failing test.
