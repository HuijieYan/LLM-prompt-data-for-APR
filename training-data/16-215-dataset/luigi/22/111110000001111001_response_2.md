The bug in the provided code is that the `time` module has not been imported, so when the `time.time()` function is called, it results in a `NameError`.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.
2. We also need to remove the `last_active` parameter default value of `None` and instead, if no `last_active` value is provided, set it to the current time.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time  # Import the time module

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With the above correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
