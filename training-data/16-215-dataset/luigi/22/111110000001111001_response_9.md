The bug in the provided code is caused by the reference to the `time` module not being imported in the class containing the buggy function. This causes the `time.time()` method to throw a `NameError` as `time` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file that contains the `Worker` class. This will allow the `time` module to be accessed within the class, and the `time.time()` method can be used to initialize the `self.started` attribute.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `time` module will be imported, and the `time.time()` method can be successfully utilized to initialize the `self.started` attribute, resolving the bug.
