The error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the case when `last_active` is initialized as `None`. This causes an error when the function tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` by setting it to the current time when the `__init__` method is called.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without any errors, as the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized and handled in the `prune` method.
