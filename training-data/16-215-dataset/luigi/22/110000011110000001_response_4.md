1. The problematic function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is attempting to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it, which results in a `TypeError` because of the `last_active` attribute being `None`.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `last_active` is set to `None`, the `prune` method tries to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` which is an `int`, resulting in a `TypeError` because of unsupported operand types for `+`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Initializing `last_active` with a default value equal to `time.time()` at the time of object creation.
   (b). Adding a check in the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`.

5. Corrected code for the `__init__` method:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if it is `None`.

Now the corrected code should pass the failing test.
