The potential error in the buggy function is that it is using the time.time() function without importing the time module. This causes the function to throw a NameError when trying to access time.time().

To fix this bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the function will work as expected and satisfy the provided input/output variable information.
