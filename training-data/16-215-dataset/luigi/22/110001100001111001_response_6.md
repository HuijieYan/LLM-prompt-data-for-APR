The potential error in the buggy function is that the `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` call is causing an AttributeError. This is evident from the discrepancy between the expected value of `self.started` and the actual value.

To fix this bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # Import the time module

# This is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # Reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # Seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # Seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # Task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After making this change, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
