1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. This method is used to initialize the Worker object with its attributes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "self.started = time.time()". This line attempts to set the attribute "started" using the "time" module, but the "time" module has not been imported in the code, so this will result in an ImportError.

3. The bug's cause is that the "time" module has not been imported in the code, so trying to use it to set the "started" attribute will result in an ImportError.

4. To fix the bug, the "time" module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code using "import time".

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
