1. The buggy function is the __init__ function of the luigi.scheduler class. It is responsible for initializing worker instances with a worker_id and last_active time as optional parameters.

2. The potential error is that the function is missing the import statement for the "time" module, which is used to access the time.time() function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the time module is not imported, so the time.time() function cannot be accessed. This will result in a "NameError: name 'time' is not defined" when the function is called.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, it is advisable to define default values for the worker_id and last_active parameters in the function signature.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id=None, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file and providing default values for the worker_id and last_active parameters, the bug is fixed.
