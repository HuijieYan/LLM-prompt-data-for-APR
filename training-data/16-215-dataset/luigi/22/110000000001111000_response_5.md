```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The issue with the original code is that it is missing the `import time` statement in order to use the `time.time()` function. Additionally, the `self.started` value should be set to the current time using `time.time()` instead of being a hard-coded value. 

The corrected function now includes the necessary import statement for `time` and sets the `self.started` value to the current time using the `time.time()` function.
