Potential error location: the bug likely lies in the `last_active` parameter, as it is set to `None` by default, but then used as a variable for `self.last_active`. 

Bug's cause: When the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it is set to `None`, and then later used in calculations without checking for its value. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Add a condition to check if `last_active` is not `None` before using it in calculations.
- Set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is now checked and assigned a default value using a conditional statement. This will ensure that the `last_active` variable is always properly initialized.
