It seems that the problem lies within the `_dict_arg` function, particularly in the way it constructs the `command` list. The issue is that it wraps the property-value pair in double quotes, but it should do so only for the value, not for the whole pair.

The potential fix for this bug is to modify the way the property-value pair is appended to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, '"'+val+'"')]  # wrap only the value in double quotes
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now properly construct the `command` list, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
