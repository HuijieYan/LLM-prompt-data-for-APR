1. The buggy function is a method called _dict_arg within the SparkSubmitTask class. This function is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input, and then parse the dictionary into a list of command arguments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where the command list is being constructed using the "+=" operator.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not constructing the command list properly. When iterating over the dictionary, the function is incorrectly reusing the "value" variable as both the dictionary key and value, which causes the function to not work as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Renaming the variable "value" in the for loop to something else, so it doesn't conflict with the function parameter.
   - Constructing the command list using append() instead of the "+=" operator to ensure proper list construction.
   - Adding type checks and error handling to handle cases where the input value is not a dictionary.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():
                command.append(name)
                command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val))
        return command
```
