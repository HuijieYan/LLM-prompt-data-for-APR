1. The buggy function is a method within the class SparkSubmitTask. It is intended to generate a command based on a dictionary of arguments. However, it has a bug in the way it concatenates the command.

2. The potential error location is in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]", where the command is being concatenated with the property and value from the dictionary.

3. The bug is caused by using the same variable name "value" for the input parameter and the loop variable in the for loop. This is causing the loop variable to overwrite the value parameter, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Renaming the loop variable in the for loop to something other than "value" to avoid the conflict with the input parameter.
   - Using a different approach to construct the command, such as appending the elements to a list and then joining them at the end.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val"
                command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])  # Changed the format of the command construction
        return command
```
