The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is not formatting the dictionary key-value pair correctly. The function is simply adding the key and value directly to the command list, but it should be formatted as "key=value" with quotes around the entire string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to format the key-value pairs correctly before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By formatting the key-value pairs as "key=value" with quotes around the entire string, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
