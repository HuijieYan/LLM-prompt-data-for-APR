To fix the buggy function, we need to change the `"_dict_arg"` function to handle dictionaries correctly and append the items to the "command" list as separate string elements rather than a single formatted string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

This fix ensures that each property and value is appended as a separate string element in the `command` list.

After applying this correction, the tests should pass without any assertion errors.
