The potential error in the buggy function is the use of quotation marks in the command list. The function is adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value pairs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into the command list. It should not include quotation marks around the property=value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function should remove the unnecessary quotation marks and format the property and value pairs correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly format the property and value pairs into the command list without unnecessary quotation marks, satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
