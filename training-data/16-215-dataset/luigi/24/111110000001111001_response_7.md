The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into strings. The values should not be enclosed in double quotes. Additionally, the function should return a string rather than a list. A corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = ""
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += "{0}={1} ".format(prop, val)
    return [name, command.strip()]
```

This function concatenates the dictionary items into a single string and returns the formatted string as part of a list, which is more suitable for command-line arguments as suggested by the class description. The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
