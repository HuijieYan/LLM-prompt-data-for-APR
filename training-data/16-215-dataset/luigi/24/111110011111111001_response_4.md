The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is incorrect because it is adding the name and value as separate items to the `command` list instead of joining them together.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly constructing the command list. It is supposed to add each property and its value to the command list in the format `name="value"`, but it is not doing so correctly, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly create the command list using a list comprehension.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [f'{name}={prop}"="{value}' for prop, value in value.items()]
    return command
```

By using a list comprehension, we are able to properly construct the `command` list by combining the `name`, `prop` and `value` into the expected format.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
