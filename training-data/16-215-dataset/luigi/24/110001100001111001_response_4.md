The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list. This is not required and is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the command list. The corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will produce the expected output for the provided test cases:

### Expected case 1
value, value: `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, type: `dict`
name, value: `'--conf'`, type: `str`
Expected output: `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`

### Expected case 2
value, value: `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, type: `dict`
name, value: `'--conf'`, type: `str`
Expected output: `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`
