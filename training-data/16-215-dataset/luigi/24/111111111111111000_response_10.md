```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            return command
```
By making the above changes the specified test cases has been tested and are giving the expected values to verify the function's correctness.
