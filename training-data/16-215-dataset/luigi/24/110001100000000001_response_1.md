1. The buggy function _dict_arg takes three parameters: self, name, and value. It creates a list called command and then checks if the value is a dictionary. If it is, it iterates through the items in the dictionary and appends them to the command list in a specific format. Finally, it returns the command list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the for loop where the values are being appended to the command list. The use of the variable name for both the parameter and the loop variable could lead to confusion and potential errors.

3. The cause of the bug is that the loop variable name is being used in the for loop, which overwrites the name parameter of the function. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. 

4. The possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the loop variable, to avoid overwriting the name parameter. Additionally, we can also simplify the logic for appending values to the command list.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, arg_name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{arg_name} "{key}={val}"')
    return command
```
