The problematic function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with the way the function is constructing the list of command arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding extra double quotes around the property value when it creates the command list. This is causing the failing tests as the test code expects the command list to contain unquoted property values.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to remove the extra double quotes when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_diec_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function should now construct the command list without extra quotes, which should make the failing tests pass.
