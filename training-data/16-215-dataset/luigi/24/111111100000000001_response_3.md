1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the class `SparkSubmitTask` in the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py`. It is designed to construct a command for submitting a Spark job based on a dictionary of arguments.

2. The potential error location is within the for loop that iterates through the dictionary items, as it is trying to construct the command list but is not doing so accurately.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the command list based on the dictionary of arguments. It is not properly constructing the command list by adding the key-value pairs from the dictionary, and it does not handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

4. Possible approaches to fix the bug:
   - Iterate through the dictionary items and properly construct the command list by appending the key-value pairs.
   - Check if the value is a dictionary before trying to iterate through it, and handle the case when it is not.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    elif value:
        command += [name, str(value)]  # handle non-dictionary values
    return command
```

In the corrected code, we now properly iterate through the dictionary items and construct the command list by appending the key-value pairs. Additionally, we added a condition to handle the case when the value is not a dictionary, in which case we simply convert it to a string and append it to the command list.
