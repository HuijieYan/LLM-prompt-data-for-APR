Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. 

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by adding the name and the formatted string to the `command` list separately, which leads to incorrect formatting and unwanted quotes around the value.

Approach to fixing the bug: We should format the entire string including the name and value, and then add it to the `command` list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
