The potential error in the function `_dict_arg` is with the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is appending the name and value pairs directly to the `command` list, but it is not wrapping the `{0}={1}` part in quotes.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not formatting the name-value pairs correctly. Instead of adding quotes around the name-value pairs, it is simply concatenating them, which leads to incorrect values in the `command` list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to construct the name-value pairs with quotes around them before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the name-value pairs with quotes around them, which will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and fix the bug.
