The problem occurs in the `_dict_arg` function, where the values are not properly formatted in the command list. The function doesn't correctly format the dictionary values when building the command list. The values in the dictionary are directly added to the command list without proper formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when adding values to the `command` list, they are properly formatted with quotes, and the key-value pairs are formatted as `key=value`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]  # Proper formatting of key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this correction, the test cases should now pass without any issues. The key-value pairs in the dictionary are properly formatted and added to the command list.

This approach also satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
