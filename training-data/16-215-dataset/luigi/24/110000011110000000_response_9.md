```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the variable name "value" to "val" to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed the quotes around {0}={1} to avoid issues with command formatting
    return command
```
