Potential error location: 
The bug seems to be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue is with the format of the string being appended to the `command` list.

Bug's cause: 
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the string being appended to the `command` list. The expected format should be `name="prop1=val1"`, but the actual format is `name, '"prop1=val1"'`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to modify the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += ['{}="{}"'.format(name, prop, value)]`.

Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            arg = '{}="{}"'.format(name, prop, value)
            command.append(arg)
    return command
```
