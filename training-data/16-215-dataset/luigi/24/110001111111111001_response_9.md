The issue in the _dict_arg function is caused by incorrectly adding quotes to the command list when building the command list. The previous implementation adds quotes around the property=value pair instead of adding quotes around the value only.

To fix the bug, the function needs to modify how it appends the elements to the command list.

```
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--conf', '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified this line
    return command
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly build the command list and pass the failing tests. This correction ensures that the output matches the expected values and types provided.
