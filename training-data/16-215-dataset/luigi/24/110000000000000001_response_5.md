1. The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary as an argument and convert it into a list of strings in the format "name='value'". However, it is not working as expected due to a potential error in the for loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the for loop that iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary.

3. The bug's cause is that the for loop is overwriting the `value` variable from the function parameters with the `value` from the dictionary items. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Renaming the variable inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the function parameter.
   (b). Using a different variable name for the dictionary items to prevent confusion.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # rename the variables to avoid overwriting
            command.append("{0}='{1}'".format(name, val))  # use append instead of +=
    return command
```
