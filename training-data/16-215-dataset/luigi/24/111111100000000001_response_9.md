Potential error location:
The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the reusing of the variable name "value" as both the input parameter and the loop variable within the function. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, due to reusing the variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable, the function may not behave as expected when iterating through the dictionary.

(b). The related class `SparkSubmitTask` seems to be part of the Luigi framework and is a template task for running a Spark job. The `_dict_arg` function is likely used within this class to generate command arguments for submitting Spark jobs.

(c). The related function `name` is not directly related to the bug, so it can be ignored for now.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the loop variable in the `_dict_arg` function should have a different name than the input parameter. Additionally, the function should handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary.

Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
