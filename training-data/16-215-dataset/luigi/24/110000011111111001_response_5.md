The issue in the given code is that the property and value are being stored within quotes in the `command` list. However, the failing test expects the value to be stored without quotes.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to remove the quotes from the appended string in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This correction should address the issues highlighted in the failing tests and fulfill the expected input/output variable information.
