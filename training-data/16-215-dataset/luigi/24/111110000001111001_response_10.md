The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a string that follows the correct format for a command to be executed.

The bug seems to be caused by the way the function is concatenating the command strings. It is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs within the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function so that it correctly creates the command list by formatting the key-value pairs into strings following the correct format for a command.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        formatted_values = ['{0}={1}'.format(prop, value) for prop, value in value.items()]
        command += [name] + formatted_values
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly format the command list as expected for the provided test cases.
