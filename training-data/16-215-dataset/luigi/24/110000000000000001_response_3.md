1. The buggy function is supposed to take in a name and a dictionary of values, and then construct a command list based on the dictionary items. However, there is a potential error in the way the command list is being constructed.

2. The potential error location is in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]". This line is trying to concatenate the name and value pairs to the command list, but it is not handling the formatting correctly.

3. The bug's cause is that the formatting of the command list is not being handled properly due to incorrect string concatenation and formatting.

4. To fix the bug, we can use the "append" function instead of concatenation and ensure the correct formatting of the command list.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
