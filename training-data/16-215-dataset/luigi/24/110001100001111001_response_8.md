The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly formats the command list by including double quotes around the key-value pairs. Additionally, it uses the same variable `value` to iterate through the dictionary, causing the original `value` variable to be overwritten. This leads to the incorrect behavior during the tests.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the formatting of the command list to include the key-value pairs without double quotes around them.
2. Use a different variable name for the iteration through the dictionary to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected based on the provided test cases.
