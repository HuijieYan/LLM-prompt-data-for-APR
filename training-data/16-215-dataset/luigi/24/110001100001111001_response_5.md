The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This is not needed and is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes need to be removed from the command list. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for both test cases.
