The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the issue. The function takes in a name and a dictionary of properties and values, and then constructs a command list based on the input. The current implementation is adding the property and value as a single string enclosed in double quotes but it shouldn't be enclosed in double quotes in the final command list. This is causing the assertion error in the test cases.

The correction should involve removing the double quotes from the generated command list inside the for loop.

To fix the bug:
1. Iterate over the dictionary passed as the `value` and construct the command list using `append` instead of `+=`.
2. Do not enclose the properties and values in double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, value))
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will properly construct the command list for the spark job based on the input dictionary.

After making this change, the failing test case for the `SparkSubmitTask` class should pass as the error was related to the formatting of the command list, and it will now be formatted correctly based on the changes applied.
