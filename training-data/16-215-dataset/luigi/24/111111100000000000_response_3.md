And here is the fixed version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
    pass

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    """

    # this is the fixed function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to 'val' to avoid confusion
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed the variable name to 'val' here as well
        return command
```
