The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This is causing the failing test as it expects the command list to have the properties and values without quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes from around the property and value in the command list creation.

Updated code for the _dict_arg function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the quotes from around prop and val
    return command
```
