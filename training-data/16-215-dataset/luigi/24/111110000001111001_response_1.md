The problem lies in the way the function is constructing the command list. It is erroneously adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will now return the expected output for the provided test cases.
