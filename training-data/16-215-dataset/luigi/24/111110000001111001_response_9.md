The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values as strings before appending them to the command list.

The correct approach to fixing this bug is to iterate over the dictionary items and format them as strings before appending them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By formatting each property and value as a string using `"{0}={1}"`, we ensure that the output matches the expected values for the given input parameters in both Case 1 and Case 2. This corrected code will satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
