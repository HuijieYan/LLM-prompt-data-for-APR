1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a name and a dictionary of values, and is supposed to construct a command using the name and the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

2. The potential error location is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the intention is to append the constructed command to the `command` list.

3. The bug is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable in the line `for prop, value in value.items()`. This causes the original value to be overwritten. As a result, the final command list does not include all the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

4. To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable to something else to avoid overwriting the original value.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
