1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. It is meant to construct a command for submitting a Spark job based on a dictionary of arguments.

2. The potential error location in the function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where it should be adding the formatted string to the `command` list. However, it is incorrectly adding a list containing `name` and the formatted string instead.

3. (a) The buggy function is intended to construct a command for submitting a Spark job based on a dictionary of arguments but has a bug in constructing the command list.
   (b) The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains the `_dict_arg` method, which has the bug. This class is used for running a Spark job.
   (c) There is a related function `name(self)` within the file, though it is not directly related to the bug in the `_dict_arg` method.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the formatted string is added to the `command` list correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f'{name}="{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

In the corrected code:
- We iterate through the items of the `value` dictionary and construct the formatted string with the key-value pair.
- Each formatted string is then added to the `command` list.
- We use an f-string for formatting the string, which is a clearer and more concise way to accomplish this.
