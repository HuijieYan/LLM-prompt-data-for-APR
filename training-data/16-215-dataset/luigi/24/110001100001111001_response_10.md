The problem with the buggy function is that it adds quotation marks around the values in the command list, even if the value is not a string. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, we need to check the type of the value before adding it to the command list. If the value is a string, we should add it with the format `"{0}={1}"`, surrounded by quotation marks. If the value is not a string, we should add it without any quotation marks.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command.append(name)
                command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
            else:
                command.append(name)
                command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected code checks the type of the value and appends it to the command list accordingly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
