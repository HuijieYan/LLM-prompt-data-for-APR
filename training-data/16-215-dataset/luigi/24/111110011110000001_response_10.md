The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in two parameters, `name` and `value`, and is supposed to iterate through the dictionary `value` and append the key-value pairs to the `command` list. However, it doesn't perform this as intended and the failing tests indicate that it's not correctly constructing the command list from the dictionary.

The failing tests indicate that the problem lies in the way the command list is being constructed using the dictionary values.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to update the function to properly iterate through the dictionary and construct the command list as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version:
1. In the for loop, the variable `value` has been renamed to `val` to avoid name conflicts with the loop and to clearly represent the individual values in the dictionary.
2. The values are appended to the `command` list using the format `name`, `key=value`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
