The issue with the given function is that it is wrapping the prop=value pair in double quotes, which is not necessary and causing the test cases to fail.

We need to modify the function to correctly format the command list without wrapping prop=value pairs in double quotes.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_dict_arg` function as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function will correctly format the command list without unnecessary double quotes.

This corrected version of the function will satisfy the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output variable information.
