The potential error lies in the `_dict_arg` function, where the value is not being handled properly when constructing the `command` list. The function is currently wrapping the value in double quotes and concatenating it with the property name, which is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable information.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes when formatting the property and value pair and just concatenate them together.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected code handles the value properly and should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
