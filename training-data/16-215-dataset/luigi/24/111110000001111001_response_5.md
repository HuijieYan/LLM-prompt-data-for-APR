The potential error lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The current implementation is incorrectly encapsulating the entire key-value pair in double quotes, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the double quotes from `"{0}={1}"` in the buggy function.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs without encapsulating them in double quotes, as expected.
