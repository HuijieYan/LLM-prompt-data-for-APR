1. The buggy function is part of the class SparkSubmitTask and is intended to handle dictionary arguments for a Spark job. It is supposed to convert the dictionary key-value pairs into command line arguments. However, it seems to have a bug that prevents it from working correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]", where it is trying to add the command with the formatted key-value pair to the list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the variable "value" is being overwritten in the for loop, which results in incorrect command generation. This is evident from the fact that the function is designed to process dictionary key-value pairs, but the buggy implementation fails to do so.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Rename the variable "value" within the for loop to something else to avoid overwriting the original value.
   - Use a different variable name within the for loop to avoid conflicts with the function argument.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    # this is the fixed function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the variable "value" to "val"
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use the renamed variable "val"
        return command
```

In the corrected code, the variable "value" within the for loop has been renamed to "val" to avoid overwriting the original value passed to the function. The command generation also uses the renamed variable "val" to correctly form the command list.
