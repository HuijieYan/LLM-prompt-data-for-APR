The issue in the _dict_arg function is the incorrect formatting of the command list. The problem arises when adding the key-value pairs to the command list, where the value is being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily.

The suggested approach for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes when appending the key-value pairs to the command list.

The corrected _dict_arg function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes here
    return command
```
