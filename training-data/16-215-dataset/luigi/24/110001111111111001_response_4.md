The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it adds unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list. This results in the incorrect format of the command list, leading to the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we should remove the quotes around the formatted string in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now properly construct the `command` list without unnecessary quoting of the property and value, which will satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information.
