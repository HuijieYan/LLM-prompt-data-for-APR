The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a method called `_dict_arg`, which seems to be related to constructing a command for a Spark job submission. The test cases provided indicate that the method is used to build a command by iterating over a dictionary and adding its key-value pairs to the command list. The error messages show that the issue lies in how the function handles key-value pairs within the dictionary.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to how key-value pairs are being handled when constructing the command. The method was incorrectly wrapping the property and value in double-quotes, as shown in the failure messages. This results in the constructed command not matching the expected command from the test cases.

To fix the bug, the approach is to modify how the key-value pairs are added to the command list. Since the key-value pairs are being directly appended to the command with an equal sign, there is no need to enclose the pairs in double quotes.

Below is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed to 'val' to avoid conflict with 'value' parameter
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double-quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the method should construct the command list correctly, allowing the class to pass the failing tests.
