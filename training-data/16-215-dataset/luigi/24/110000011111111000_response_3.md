The issue lies in the `for` loop that adds items to the `command` list. The `value` and `prop` should not be enclosed in double quotes when adding to the `command` list. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification ensures that the values in the `value` dictionary are not enclosed in double quotes and should resolve the failing test cases described in the prompt.
