The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it improperly constructs the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. In the current implementation, it does not properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a single string as expected by the test cases. This results in a mismatch with the expected list of command values.

The expected behavior is to construct a command list where each key-value pair in the input dictionary is formatted as a single string in the format `"{key}={value}"`. However, the current implementation wraps the key-value pair with double quotes and an equal sign, which is not expected by the test cases.

To fix this issue, the function should construct the command list by properly formatting the key-value pairs without wrapping them with double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test cases.
