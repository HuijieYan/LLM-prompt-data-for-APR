1. The buggy function is meant to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of strings representing key-value pairs. However, it has a few issues that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]". This line is attempting to append the key-value pairs to the 'command' list, but it is not doing so correctly.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of string formatting within the list append operation. It's also not handling the case where the value is not a dictionary.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the input value is a dictionary before processing it
   - Use string formatting outside of the list append operation
   - Return the list of strings after processing the dictionary

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
