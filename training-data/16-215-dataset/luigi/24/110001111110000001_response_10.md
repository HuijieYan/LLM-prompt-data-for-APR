The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding quotes around each key-value pair in the dictionary, which is causing the failing tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to not add quotes around each key-value pair in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should no longer add quotes around the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and the failing tests should pass.
