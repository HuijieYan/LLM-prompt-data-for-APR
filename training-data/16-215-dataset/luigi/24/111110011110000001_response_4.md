The problem in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect generation of the `command` list. The function iterates through the input dictionary and adds items to the `command` list by appending the `name` and `value`, but it incorrectly includes the values in quotation marks.

To fix this bug, the function should create a list of key-value pairs in the format "key=value" without enclosing them in quotation marks.

A corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this change, the `command` list will contain the key-value pairs without quotation marks. This will fix the failing test and resolve the error encountered during the comparison of expected and actual command arguments.
