The function `_dict_arg`  is intended to take a `name` and `value` as input and generate a list of commands based on the `value` if it is a dictionary. The function appears to be incorrectly adding double quotes around the values of the properties in the command list.

The failing test and error message indicate that the `--conf` argument in the command list contains a property-value pair enclosed in double quotes, while it should not be quoted. This suggests that the issue lies in the way the function constructs the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs and the corresponding properties in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

The corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function will generate the command list without enclosing the property-value pairs in double quotes, and the failing test should pass.
