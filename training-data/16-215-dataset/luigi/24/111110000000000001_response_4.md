1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the class `SparkSubmitTask`. It is intended to construct a command for submitting a Spark job with properties and values from a dictionary.

2. The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue seems to be with the concatenation of the command list with the property and value, as well as the use of double quotes around the property and value.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list due to incorrect concatenation of elements and formatting of the property and value.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a different approach for constructing the command list
   - Fix the formatting of the property and value when adding them to the command list

5. Corrected code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the value variable to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # use -- instead of double quotes for property and value
        return command
```
