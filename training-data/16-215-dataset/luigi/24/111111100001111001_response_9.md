The buggy function is supposed to take a dictionary and a name as input, iterate over the dictionary, and build a list of strings representing key-value pairs, each enclosed in double quotes and separated by an equal sign. However, the function is not correctly creating the list of strings.

The bug in the function is that it is not enclosing the whole key-value pair within double quotes, as required by the expected output. Instead, it only encloses the value part within double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the entire key-value pair is enclosed within double quotes.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
