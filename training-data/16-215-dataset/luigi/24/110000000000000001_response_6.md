1. The buggy function is supposed to take in a dictionary as an argument and transform it into a list of strings. However, there is a potential error in the implementation.

2. The potential error is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is incorrectly trying to add the name and formatted key-value pair as separate elements to the command list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the name and formatted key-value pair are being added as separate elements to the command list, which is not the desired behavior. The function should concatenate the name and formatted key-value pair into a single string and then add it to the command list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Concatenating the name and formatted key-value pair before adding it to the command list.
   - Using a list comprehension to build the command list in a more concise and readable way.
   - Ensuring that the function handles empty dictionaries or non-dictionary values appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command = [f'{name} "{key}={val}"' for key, val in value.items()]
    return command
```
