The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the value when generating the command list. This is causing the test to fail as it is expecting the value without quotes.

To fix this, we can remove the quotes when constructing the command list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modified function will now construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes, which should resolve the failing tests.
