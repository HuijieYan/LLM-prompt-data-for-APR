The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to extract the command-line arguments from the input dictionary and build a list of commands. However, the current implementation is not handling strings correctly and is creating an unwanted list of strings.

The issue is that the function is wrapping the property and value in double quotes. This is not necessary and causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug:
- Remove the double quotes around the property and value in the `_dict_arg` function.
- Update the logic to directly append the property and value to the command list without unnecessary formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now generate the correct command list and pass the failing tests.
