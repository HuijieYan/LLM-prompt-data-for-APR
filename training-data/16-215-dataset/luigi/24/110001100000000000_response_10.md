# The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
    pass

# The corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command.append('{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Changed the formatting to use double quotes
        command.insert(0, name)  # Insert the name at the beginning of the command list
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable names have been changed to avoid conflicts, and the command list is now formatted correctly with the name at the beginning and double quotes around the property-value pairs.
