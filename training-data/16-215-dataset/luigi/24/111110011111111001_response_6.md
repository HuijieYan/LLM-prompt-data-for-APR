The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the values in the command list, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to handle the dictionary items without adding additional quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the `command` list will be constructed properly and without additional quotation marks around the values, which will match the expected output from the failing tests.
