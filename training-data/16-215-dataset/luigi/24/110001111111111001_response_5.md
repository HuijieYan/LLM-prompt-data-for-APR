The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotes around the value when constructing the command list, when it shouldn't. This is causing the discrepancy with the expected value in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should not add quotes around the value when constructing the command list. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information provided.
