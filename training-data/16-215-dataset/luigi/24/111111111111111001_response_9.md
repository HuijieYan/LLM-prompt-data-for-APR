The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it's incorrectly wrapping the values in double quotes which causes the test failures. The function shouldn't wrap the values in double quotes before appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the formatting of the string, we ensure that the values will not be wrapped in double quotes.

This corrected code should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
