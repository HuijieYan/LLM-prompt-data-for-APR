The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the use of `" "` around the `{0}={1}` formatting. This is resulting in the incorrect output because it is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks from around the `{0}={1}`, so the corrected function would be:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

This modified function should now correctly generate the expected output for the provided test cases.
