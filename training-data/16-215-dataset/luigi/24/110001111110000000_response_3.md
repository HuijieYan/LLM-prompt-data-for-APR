The issue in the function "_dict_arg" is that it adds quotation marks around the property-value pair when constructing the command list for a dictionary argument. This leads to a mismatch when the list is later compared with the expected command list in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the "_dict_arg" function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the quotation marks around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotation marks, the function now correctly constructs the command list and the tests should pass without any issues.
