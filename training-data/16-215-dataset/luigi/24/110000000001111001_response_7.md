Potential Error Location:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Here, the `name` is added as a separate element to the `command` list, instead of being included in the string.

Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `name` to be added as a separate element in the `command` list, and the string formatting is not performed as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to properly format the string and include `name` within the string.
2. Use string concatenation to build the command string in the correct format.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
