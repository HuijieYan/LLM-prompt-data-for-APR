The problem with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is creating the command list incorrectly when the input value is a dictionary. Instead of adding the items directly, it should be adding a formatted string with the key-value pairs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is being caused by appending elements to the `command` list using `+` operator which is causing incorrect list items as output. Additionally, the function is wrapping the key-value pair in double quotes which is not necessary.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. We can use list comprehension to create the list with formatted strings for each key-value pair.
2. Remove unnecessary double quotes from the key-value pair string.

### Corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # other class methods

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            command.extend([name] + ['{0}={1}'.format(prop, val) for prop, val in value.items()])
        return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will return the expected output based on the provided test cases.
