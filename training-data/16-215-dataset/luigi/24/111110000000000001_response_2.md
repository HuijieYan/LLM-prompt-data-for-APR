1. The buggy function is a method of the SparkSubmitTask class, which is a template task for running a Spark job. The function is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, iterate through the dictionary items, and append them to a command list.

2. The potential error location is the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where `name` and `value` are being added to the `command` list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the function. This causes the loop variable to overwrite the input parameter.

4. To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop variable
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Use prop and prop_value instead of name and value
        return command
```
