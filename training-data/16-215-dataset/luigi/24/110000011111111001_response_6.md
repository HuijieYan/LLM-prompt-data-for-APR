The issue in the given function is that it is wrapping the values in double quotes, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix the issue, we should remove the double quotes from the value when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct command list and pass the failing tests.
