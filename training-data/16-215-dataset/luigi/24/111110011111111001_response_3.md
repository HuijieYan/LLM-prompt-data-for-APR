The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the `name=value` pairs when creating the command list.

The problem stems from the following lines:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
This is adding the `name` and `value` with quotes to the `command` list, which is causing the discrepancy with the expected results.

To fix the function, the code should be updated to generate the command list without quotes around the `{0}={1}` format.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

This updated function should now satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information.
