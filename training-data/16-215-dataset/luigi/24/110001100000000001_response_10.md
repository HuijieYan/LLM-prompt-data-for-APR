1. The _dict_arg function takes a name and a value as input, and if the value is a dictionary, it creates a list of strings formatted as "{name}={value}" for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

2. The potential error lies in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]" where the name and value are being added to the command list without proper formatting.

3. The cause of the bug is that the name and value are being added as separate elements to the command list without proper formatting. This will result in an incorrect command list.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use string formatting for the entire "{name}={value}" expression within the list comprehension. Another approach is to use the append method to add the formatted string to the command list.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
