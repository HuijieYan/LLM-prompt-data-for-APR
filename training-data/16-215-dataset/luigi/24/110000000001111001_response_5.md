The potential error in the buggy function is with the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is combining the `name` and the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` with the values of `prop` and `value` without any separation. This is causing the command list to be populated with the values of `name`, `prop`, and `value` all combined together, instead of `name` and the formatted string being separate entries in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line that is causing the issue to ensure that `name` and the formatted string are added as separate items in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the value variable to val to avoid conflict
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Modified this line to add name and formatted string as separate items
    return command
```

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
