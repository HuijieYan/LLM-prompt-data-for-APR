Upon analyzing the provided source code and error message, it appears that the issue lies with the `_dict_arg` function. The current implementation does not correctly format the dictionary items into the command list, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

The potential error location is the loop where the dictionary items are being added to the `command` list.

The bug is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list. We will also remove unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary items and pass the failing tests.
