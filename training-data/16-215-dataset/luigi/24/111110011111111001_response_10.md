The source of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not properly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. The function is adding quotation marks around the key-value pair, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding quotation marks around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list correctly and will return the expected values for the given input parameters.
