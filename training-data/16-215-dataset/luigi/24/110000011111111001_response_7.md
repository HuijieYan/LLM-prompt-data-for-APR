The problem is with the `command` variable in the `_dict_arg` function. Instead of adding the key-value pair to the command list as `"prop=value"`, it is adding it as `prop=value`. This is causing the test cases to fail because the expected output includes the key-value pair within double quotes.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to include the key-value pairs with double quotes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Add key-value pair with double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for the given input test cases and should also pass the failing tests.
