The issue in the _dict_arg method is that it incorrectly adds quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual one, causing the tests to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _dict_arg method to construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the quotes around {1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the _dict_arg method will properly construct the command list without adding quotes around the values. This should make the method compatible with the tests and ensure that it passes without any issues.
