1. The function is intended to take a dictionary as an argument and create a command array from it. However, the function is not working as intended and is producing incorrect output.

2. The potential error is in the for loop where the function is iterating through the dictionary items.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is overwriting the 'value' variable inside the for loop, resulting in incorrect command generation.

4. Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Renaming the variable inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the 'value' variable
   - Using a different approach to construct the command array from the dictionary

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the variable to 'val' to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use the renamed variable 'val' here
    return command
```
