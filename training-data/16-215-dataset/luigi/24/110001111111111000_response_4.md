To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the command list includes the dictionary items in the specified format, without additional quotation marks. To do this, we need to check for the presence of spaces in the dictionary values and format the items accordingly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if ' ' in val:  # Check if the value contains a space
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Add quotes if a space is present
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # No quotes needed if there are no spaces
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly format the dictionary items based on the presence of spaces in the values, as expected in the failing tests.
