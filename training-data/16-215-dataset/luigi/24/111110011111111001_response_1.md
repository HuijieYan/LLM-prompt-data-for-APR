The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values. The `value` items should be added to the `command` list without quotes in addition to the format method used in the original code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This change ensures that the dictionary items are added to the `command` list without quotes and use the `format` method for proper formatting.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information provided.
