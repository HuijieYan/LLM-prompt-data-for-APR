1. The buggy function is a method that takes three parameters, namely self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to create a command list.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the command list is being created by concatenating the name and formatted prop-value pair.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the command list. The current implementation is not creating the command list as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Using a different approach to create the command list, such as using a list comprehension.
   b. Checking for the presence of the value before processing it.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command = [f'{name}="{prop}={val}"' for prop, val in value.items()]
    return command
```
