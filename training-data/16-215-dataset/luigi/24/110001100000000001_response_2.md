1. The buggy function _dict_arg takes three parameters: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and if so, it iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a command list. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation of this function.

2. The potential error is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

3. The cause of the bug is that the variable name is being overwritten in the for loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This is because the same name is being reused in the for loop for both the dictionary key and the value. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the variable name in the for loop to something different to avoid overwriting the function parameter.
   - Use a different approach to construct the command list, such as using string concatenation or a list comprehension.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```
