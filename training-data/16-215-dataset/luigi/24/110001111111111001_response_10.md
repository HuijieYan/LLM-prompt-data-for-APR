The issue with the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the `command` list. It is incorrectly adding quotes around the values of the dictionary, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests. The expected format for the values in the `command` list is without additional quotes, as per the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should construct the `command` list without adding additional quotes around the values of the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
