The bug in the function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command, but the expected behavior is to add the property and value without quotes.

The fix for the bug is to remove the quotes when constructing the command. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will construct the command without adding unnecessary quotes. This will make it pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
