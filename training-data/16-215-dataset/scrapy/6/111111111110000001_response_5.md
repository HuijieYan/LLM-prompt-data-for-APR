The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the image format and mode in the `convert_image` function. The failing test is checking for the mode and colors of the image after conversion, and it's failing on those assertions.

The issue lies in the part of the function where it checks for the image format and mode and converts the image accordingly. The logic within the `if` statements is likely causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different image modes and formats, ensuring that the conversion retains the properties expected by the test.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the revised conversion logic ensures that the image format and mode are handled correctly, addressing the issues identified by the failing test.
