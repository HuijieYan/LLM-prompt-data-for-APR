The buggy function has an issue when it encounters images with the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA'. It tries to convert them to 'RGB', but the conversion process is incorrect, resulting in incorrect outputs.

The buggy class `ImagesPipeline` appears to be an abstract pipeline that implements image thumbnail generation logic. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of this class and is responsible for converting and resizing images.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values show that the function is not handling images with the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA' correctly. It is also not resizing images accurately when a size is provided as an input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles images with the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA'. Additionally, the function needs to accurately resize images when a size is provided as an input.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """


    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf

```

With this refactored code, the buggy logic of converting 'PNG' images with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' is fixed. Additionally, accurate resizing using the `resize` method is implemented. The corrected code now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
