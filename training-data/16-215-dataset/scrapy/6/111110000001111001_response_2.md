The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to a specific format and size. The function encounters bugs in several cases, such as when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', or when the mode of the image is not 'RGB'. The function also has issues with handling the size parameter.

The potential error location within the function is in the conditional statements that handle image format and mode. Additionally, the function does not handle the size parameter properly.

The bug's cause is the incorrect handling of the input image format and mode, as well as the size parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to properly handle images with the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode and configure the size parameter correctly for generating thumbnails.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the images with different formats and modes, as well as the size parameter, as described in the expected input/output variable information.
