It seems the issue lies within the `convert_image` function where the condition for checking if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect. When the condition is met, the conversion to a new image with a white background and then converting it to 'RGB' is not functioning as expected. 

To fix this issue, a new method will be added to check for the image format and mode separately. Also, 'buf' will be reset with `BytesIO()` before writing to it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        bg_color = (255, 255, 255)
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            if image.format == 'PNG':
                background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, bg_color)
                background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
                image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```
