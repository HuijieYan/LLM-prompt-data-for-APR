1. The buggy function "convert_image" is a method of the class ImagesPipeline, which is a subclass of FilesPipeline. This method is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition for checking the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect. The condition is checking for a specific format and mode, and if it matches, it converts the image to a different format without considering the original format. This can lead to incorrect conversion and loss of image data.

4. To fix the bug, the condition for checking the image format and mode should be modified to correctly handle the image conversion based on its original format and mode. Additionally, the method can be modified to handle different image formats and modes more gracefully.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import ImagesPipeline

class CustomImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format in ['PNG', 'GIF']:
            if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
                image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking the image format and mode has been modified to handle multiple formats and modes. The method now checks for both 'PNG' and 'GIF' formats and converts them to 'RGB' mode if the original mode is 'RGBA' or 'P'. The rest of the code remains the same.
