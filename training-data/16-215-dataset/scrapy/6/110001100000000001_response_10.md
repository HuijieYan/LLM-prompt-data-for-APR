1. The buggy function is supposed to convert images to a specified format and size. The potential error location is the conditional check for the image format and mode.

2. The potential error is in the conditional check for the image format and mode. The function may not behave as expected when checking the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional check for the image format and mode is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add additional conditional checks for other image formats and modes.
   - Use a more comprehensive library or method for image format and mode detection.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.format != 'JPEG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, additional checks for other image formats and modes have been added to make the function more comprehensive. The conditional statement for image mode has also been adjusted to include a check for image format. This should help in ensuring that the function behaves as expected for a wider range of input images.
