The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The purpose of this function is to convert the image to a specified size and format.

The potential error in the function is the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. This condition checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If these conditions are met, the code creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it, then converts the image to RGB format. The bug is likely to be in the `background.paste(image, image)` line, where `image` should be replaced by the tuple `(0, 0)` representing the top left corner.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect usage of the `paste` method in the `PIL` library, or potentially incorrect conditions for the image format and mode.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to rework the conditions and the logic of the function to ensure it correctly handles images of different formats and modes, and to properly apply the background paste operation.

The corrected code for the `convert_image` function is provided below:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0))
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is now handled correctly: the `paste` method is used with the correct syntax `(image, (0, 0))`, and the background image is created with the 'RGB' mode instead of 'RGBA'. This should fix the bug and improve the functionality of the `convert_image` function.
