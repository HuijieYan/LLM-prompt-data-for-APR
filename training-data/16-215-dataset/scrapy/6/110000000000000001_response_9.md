1. The buggy function is intended to convert an image to a specific format and size. However, there are some issues with the code that need to be fixed.

2. The potential error location is in the if-elif-else statement where the image format and mode are being checked and manipulated.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling all possible scenarios for image format and mode. There are also issues with the way the image is being processed and saved.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for all possible image formats and modes, and handling each scenario appropriately.
   - Making sure the image is properly processed before saving it.
   - Ensuring that the function returns the correct image and buffer after processing.


5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the image format is 'JPEG' or if the mode is not 'RGB', in which case it converts the image to RGB format. Then, it resizes the image if a size is provided. Finally, it saves the image to a buffer in JPEG format and returns both the image and the buffer.
