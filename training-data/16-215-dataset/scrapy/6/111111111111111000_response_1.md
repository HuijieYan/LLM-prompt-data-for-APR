The issue with the buggy code is that it incorrectly handles the conversion of images. The code should be updated to correctly convert images and maintain the correct format, mode, and size.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
        new_image = Image.open(buf)

        return new_image, buf
```

The main updates include:
1. Correctly creating an RGB background and pasting the RGBA image onto it.
2. Converting the image to RGB if it's not already in that format.
3. After saving the image to the buffer, we reset the buffer position to the beginning and then open a new image from it.
4. When the function returns, it returns the new image and the buffer with the correct content.
