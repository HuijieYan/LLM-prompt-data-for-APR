This buggy function is designed to convert images to JPEG format and resize them if a size is provided. However, there are several issues identified in the cases and the function itself.

1. The function is not handling the image format properly. It should not convert JPEG images to RGB unnecessarily.
2. When resizing the image, the function is not updating the image size properly.
3. For PNG images with RGBA mode, the function is not pasting the image onto a new background correctly.

To fix these issues, the following approaches can be taken:
- Add a condition to check if the image format is already JPEG before performing any conversion.
- Update the image size after resizing so that the new size is reflected in the output.
- Fix the background paste operation for PNG images with RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format != 'JPEG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the issues identified in the test cases should be resolved and the function should produce the expected results.
