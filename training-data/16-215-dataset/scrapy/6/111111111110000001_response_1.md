### Analysis
The function `convert_image` is supposed to take an image and optionally a size and convert it to a JPEG format. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the conversion, as the resulting image does not match the expected output.

The potential error lies in the conditional block that checks the format and mode of the image. It may not be converting the image format and mode as expected, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Cause
The bug could be caused by incorrect conditional checks for image format and mode. Additionally, the handling of the transparency case for RGBA and PNG images may not be correct.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the conditional checks for image format and mode to ensure that the correct conversion logic is applied.
2. Ensure that transparency handling for RGBA and PNG images is correctly implemented.
3. Use the Pillow library's image processing functions to handle the conversions and thumbnail creation accurately.

### Corrected Code
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

With the corrected code, the conditional checks for image format and mode have been adjusted to ensure that the correct conversions are applied. Additionally, the handling of transparency for RGBA and PNG images has been modified. This corrected code should now pass the failing test.
