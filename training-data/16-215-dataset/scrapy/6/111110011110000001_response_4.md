1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a JPEG format, but it is failing for images with PNG format and RGBA mode. The failing test is using images with different color modes and sizes to check the behavior of the `convert_image` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. It is failing to properly handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function is creating a new image with a white background, pasting the original image onto the new background, and then converting it to 'RGB'. However, this process is not handled correctly for images with PNG format and RGBA mode, as evidenced by the failing test and error message.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle PNG format and RGBA mode images separately to correctly convert them to 'RGB'.
   - Use the correct method to convert images from PNG format and RGBA mode to a simple 'RGB' mode.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Correctly handle PNG format and RGBA mode
            image.load()  # Load image data
            converted = image.convert("RGB")  # Convert to RGB
        else:
            converted = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB

        if size:
            converted.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)  # Create thumbnail with given size

        buf = BytesIO()  # Create a buffer to save the image
        converted.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the converted image to the buffer
        buf.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the buffer
        return converted, buf  # Return the converted image and the buffer
```

With the corrected code above, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG format and RGBA mode images correctly and pass the failing test.
