The potential error location within the problematic function is in the first conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. 

The bug's cause is that when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function is creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it. However, it is incorrectly using the original image as the paste argument instead of the background image.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image onto the background image and then convert it to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we create a new RGB background image, then paste the original RGBA image onto it. We then convert the background image to 'RGB' and continue with the rest of the function.
