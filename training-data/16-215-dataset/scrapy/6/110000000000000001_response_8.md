1. The buggy function is a method for converting an image to a different format and size. It takes an image and an optional size as input, and then performs various operations on the image based on its format and mode.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. The paste operation and conversion of the image may not work as intended.

3. The cause of the bug is that the paste operation and conversion of the image inside the conditional statement may not be functioning correctly, leading to unexpected results when the function is used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the conditional statement to properly handle the image format and mode.
   - Correct the paste and conversion operations within the conditional statement.
   - Ensure that the image is properly handled based on its format and mode.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # return to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The paste operation is fixed by specifying the position (0, 0) for pasting the image onto the background.
- The buffer is returned to the beginning after saving the image, to ensure that it can be read from the start.
