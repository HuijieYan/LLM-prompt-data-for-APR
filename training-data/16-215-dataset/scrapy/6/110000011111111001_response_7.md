The bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode correctly. The function is converting the image to RGB, but it should first create a new RGBA image with a white background and then paste the original image onto the new one.

The failing test shows that the getcolors() method is returning incorrect values for the expected and actual converted images. This indicates that the image conversion is not being performed correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
