The main issue in the provided code is the incorrect use of the `paste` method on the background image. This method should take a position as its second argument, not the image itself.

The `paste` method should be called as `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, which specifies the position to paste the image onto the background.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code should now satisfy all the provided test cases and their expected input/output variable information.
