The problem with the `convert_image` function is that when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new image with white background, pastes the original image onto the background, and then converts it to 'RGB'. However, the return values of the function should be the converted image and a buffer.

The bug is specifically in the section that handles the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. It should create a new RGB image, paste the original image onto the new background, and then save it to a buffer.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
