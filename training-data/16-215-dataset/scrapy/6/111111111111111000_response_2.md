The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the image conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode. The function is not checking if the image format is PNG before performing the RGBA mode check. Additionally, the alpha channel is not removed when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Only paste the RGB part, ignoring alpha
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function now properly handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode by creating a new RGB background and pasting the RGB part of the original image onto it, effectively ignoring the alpha channel. This ensures that the resulting image is in RGB mode without the alpha channel.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected results for the given input cases.
