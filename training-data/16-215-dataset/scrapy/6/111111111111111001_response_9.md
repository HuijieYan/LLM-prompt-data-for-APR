It appears that the issue with the `convert_image` function is within the conditional block that checks for the image format and mode. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly convert the image or create a new background, resulting in the incorrect output in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block to correctly handle the different image formats and modes. Specifically, we need to ensure that the background is created and applied properly when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO


class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS, centering=(0.5, 0.5))
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle different image formats and modes, and the failing test should pass.
