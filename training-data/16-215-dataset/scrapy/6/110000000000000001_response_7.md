The potential error in the buggy function is that the image is being saved to a BytesIO buffer, but the function is returning both the image and the buffer. This is redundant and not consistent with the function's purpose, which seems to be to convert and resize the image.

To fix this function, we can remove the return of the image and only return the buffer. If needed, the calling function can extract the image from the buffer.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return buf
```

This function now takes only the image and size as parameters, and it returns the BytesIO buffer. The calling function can use this buffer to save the image to a file or do any other processing as needed.
