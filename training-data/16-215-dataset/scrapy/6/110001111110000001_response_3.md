The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert images of different formats to either RGB or JPEG format depending on certain conditions. The failing test checks for the correct conversion of images with different formats and sizes. The error message indicates a problem with the color being returned after the conversion.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the color of the converted image is checked using `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`. This assertion is failing, indicating that the converted colors are not as expected.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the image conversion not being handled correctly. The function does not handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format, and it also does not handle the case where the image has transparency and needs to be converted to JPEG format.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Add a condition to handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format, preserving the transparency.
2. Add a condition to handle the conversion of images with transparency to JPEG format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB', background=Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255)))
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the function now checks for RGBA images and converts them to RGB format while preserving transparency. It also handles the thumbnail size and the format for saving the image. This corrected function should pass the failing test.
