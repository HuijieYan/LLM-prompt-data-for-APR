The potential error in the buggy function is in the `convert_image` function. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle PNG images with an 'RGBA' mode. As a result, it leads to an incorrect conversion of the image to the RGB format. This bug is leading to the improper selection of the image mode by not considering the alpha transparency channel properly.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle PNG images with an 'RGBA' mode and also consider resizing the image correctly using the specified size. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the function checks for the image mode and converts it to 'RGB' if the mode is 'RGBA' without considering the format explicitly. Then it proceeds to resize the image if a size is specified and finally saves and returns the image and the buffer.
