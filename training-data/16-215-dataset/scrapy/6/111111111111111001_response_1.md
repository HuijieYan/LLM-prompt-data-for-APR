The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the processing of PNG images with an RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts these images to RGB, resulting in the loss of transparency.

1. The `convert_image` function takes an image and an optional size, and it transforms the input image to a JPEG format. However, when the input image is in the PNG format and has an RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts it to RGB, causing the loss of transparency.

2. The `convert_image` function is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which appears to be a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The failing test for this function is checking if the converted image retains its original mode and transparency.

3. The error message indicates that in the failing test, the converted image is expected to retain its original transparency, which is not happening. This discrepancy between the expected and actual output suggests that the function is not handling PNG images with an RGBA mode correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to handle PNG images with an RGBA mode differently. Instead of converting them to RGB, we should preserve the transparency. One approach to achieve this is to check if the input image is a PNG with an RGBA mode and then handle it accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Preserve transparency by creating a new image with RGBA mode
            new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = new_image
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function checks if the input image is a PNG with an RGBA mode. If it is, the function creates a new image with an RGBA mode, pastes the original image onto it, and then uses the new image for further processing. This way, the transparency of the PNG image is preserved.
