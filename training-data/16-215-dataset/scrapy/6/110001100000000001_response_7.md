1. The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to a different format and size. It checks the format and mode of the image and applies different conversions based on the conditions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statements that check the format and mode of the image.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The bug arises from the conditional statements in the `convert_image` function. It incorrectly handles the conversion of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It also may not correctly handle the conversion of images with mode other than 'RGB'.
   (b). The related function `Image.new` and `image.convert` are used to create a new image with the specified mode and convert the image to a different format, respectively. However, the usage within the conditional statements may not be correctly implemented, leading to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Refactor the conditional statements to handle the conversion of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' correctly.
   (b). Ensure that the conditional statements appropriately handle the conversion of images with different modes.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Changed RGBA to RGB
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Updated the paste method arguments
        image = background  # Removed the convert call
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been refactored to handle the conversion of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' correctly. Also, the paste method and image format have been updated, and the return value of the function has been modified to include the buffer position reset.
