The buggy function is `convert_image`. It takes an image and a size as input, converts the format of the image to 'RGB' and resizes the image to the specified size, if provided. The bug is likely due to incorrect transparency handling when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the functionality of the `convert_image` function by creating images of different formats and modes, then converting them and checking if the results match the expected output. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the output.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `convert_image` function doesn't handle transparency properly when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle transparency when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. This can be achieved by checking the alpha channel in the input image and handling transparency appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Handle transparency in PNG images with RGBA mode
            r, g, b, a = image.split()
            image = Image.merge("RGB", (r, g, b))
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By handling transparency in the PNG images with RGBA mode separately and converting the images correctly, we can ensure that the `convert_image` function works as intended and passes the failing test.
