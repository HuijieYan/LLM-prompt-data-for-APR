1. The buggy function is a method that is expected to convert an image to JPEG format and thumbnail. The failing test is checking the behavior of the `convert_image` method with various types of images and sizes. The error message indicates that the test is failing with a message about lists differing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of the image to a different format and thumbnailing size.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect conversion of the image to a different format and thumbnailing size, which is not producing the expected results. The failing test is expecting certain colors and sizes after the conversion, but the buggy function is not generating the expected result. This is causing the test to fail.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
    - Check the image format and mode correctly before applying any conversion.
    - Ensure that the thumbnailing size is being applied as expected and keeping the correct image ratio.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

class ImageProcessor:
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)  # Fix orientation issue
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With the corrected code, the `convert_image` method properly handles the image format and mode, applies the thumbnail size, and saves the image in JPEG format. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
