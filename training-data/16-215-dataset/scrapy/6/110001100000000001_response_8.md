1. The buggy function is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of images from RGBA to RGB format and the resizing of images to a specific size.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the image conversion part, specifically the condition for checking if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `paste` method and the use of `convert` method without checking for the image mode.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
   - Refactor the conditional statements to correctly handle the conversion of images from RGBA to RGB and vice versa.
   - Ensure that the resizing of images is done correctly and consistently for all image formats.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
