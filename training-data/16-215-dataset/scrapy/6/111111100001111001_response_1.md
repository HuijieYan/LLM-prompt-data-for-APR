The potential error lies in the conditional statement for converting the image to RGB if the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. The code in the if block is incorrect, and it should be fixed to correctly convert the image to RGB in this case.

The root cause of the bug is that the background.paste() method is being used incorrectly. The method expects the second argument to be a tuple representing the position to paste the image, not the image itself. This results in the image not being converted to RGB as intended.

To fix the bug, the if block should be modified to use the correct syntax for pasting the image onto the background and converting it to RGB. Additionally, the else if block for image mode != 'RGB' should be updated to an else block to handle other image modes as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, as well as handle other image formats and modes appropriately, satisfying all the expected input/output variable information provided.
