The issue with the buggy function is that the condition to check for the image format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' is incorrect. Additionally, the conversion of the image to RGB mode is not being done in the expected way.

The potential error location is within the first conditional statement that checks for the image format and mode.

The cause of the bug is that the condition to check for the image format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' is incorrect, and the image mode conversion is not being done properly. This leads to discrepancies in the expected and actual output values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition to check for the image format and mode.
2. Ensure that the image mode conversion is done correctly according to the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided in all the test cases.
