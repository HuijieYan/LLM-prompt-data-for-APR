1. The buggy function takes an image and converts it to a different format and size, then saves it as a JPEG file. However, there are some issues with the code such as potential errors with the image format, mode, and saving process.

2. The potential error locations in the code are the if conditions checking for image format and mode, and the saving process using BytesIO and image.save().

3. The main cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the input image has a format other than PNG and a mode other than RGBA or RGB.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check for the image format and mode before processing the image
   - Handling different image formats and modes appropriately
   - Improving the saving process to ensure the correct format and quality

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    image = image.copy()  # Create a copy of the original image to avoid modifying it
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- We make a copy of the input image to avoid modifying the original image.
- We handle different image formats and modes appropriately.
- We fix the saving process to ensure the correct format and quality, and we reset the buffer to the beginning after saving the image.
