1. The buggy function "convert_image" is a method within the "ImagesPipeline" class. It is responsible for converting and resizing images, and then saving the result as a JPEG.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. There may also be potential issues with the image resizing and saving process.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The conditional statement for PNG format and RGBA mode may not be functioning as expected, resulting in an incorrect conversion.
   (b). Additionally, the image resizing and saving process may not be handled correctly, leading to potential errors in the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the conditional statement to properly handle PNG format and RGBA mode conversions.
   (b). Ensure that the image resizing and saving process is handled accurately, using the appropriate methods and parameters.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement for PNG format and RGBA mode has been updated to create a new RGB background and paste the original image onto it. Additionally, the image resizing and saving process has been adjusted to ensure proper handling.
