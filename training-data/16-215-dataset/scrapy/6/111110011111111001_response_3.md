The issue with the buggy function lies in the first if condition which incorrectly checks for the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' and incorrectly converts it to 'RGB'.

The failing test is indicating that the function is not converting the image as expected. The first issue is caused by the fact that the function is unconditionally converting any PNG RGBA image to RGB by pasting it onto a white background, which is an incorrect behavior.

To solve this issue, the function should only convert an RGBA image to RGB if it contains transparency. Otherwise, it should convert it directly to RGB without any background. Additionally, the function should also retain the original palette colors if the image mode is 'P'.

With these considerations in mind, updating the function to handle these cases would be the best approach to fix the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA') or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
            # Convert transparent PNG or RGBA to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        else:
            # Convert to RGB without adding a white background
            image = ImageOps.invert(image.convert('RGB')).convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with incorrect conditional checks for image format and mode, and handles the conversion of images correctly according to the specified conditions. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
