The issue in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't handle the case where the input image format is already 'JPEG'. In this case, the function should simply resize the image to the specified size and return it, without any need to create a new background or convert the image.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' before creating a new background and converting the image. Otherwise, it should simply resize the image to the specified size, if provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """ 
    
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where the input image is already in 'JPEG' format, as well as the specified resizing behavior.
