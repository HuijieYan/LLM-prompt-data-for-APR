The bug in the provided function seems to be with the handling of the image format and mode. The function is expected to convert images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB' and convert all other image modes to 'RGB' as well. However, the handling of the format and mode is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', then create a new background with mode 'RGB' and paste the original image onto it. After that, convert the image to mode 'RGB'. For all other cases, we can simply convert the image to mode 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', as well as other image formats and modes, and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
