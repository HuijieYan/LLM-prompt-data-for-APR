The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of image conversion and thumbnail resizing in the `convert_image` function. The function fails to correctly convert images to RGB and resize them when required.

The failing test case specifically fails when comparing the colors of the converted images, indicating that the conversion is not being performed correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the image is properly converted to RGB and resized when necessary.

The corrected code for the `convert_image` function is as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this updated code, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle image conversion to RGB and thumbnail resizing. This should address the failing test and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
