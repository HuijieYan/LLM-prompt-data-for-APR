1. The buggy function is part of a class called ImagesPipeline which is inheriting from FilesPipeline. The function is designed to convert an image to a specified size and format.

2. The potential error location within the function is the condition "if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'". There might be an issue with the comparison of the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition "if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'" is never met, leading to the code within that block not executing. This results in incorrect image conversion when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Double-check the comparison of image format and mode to ensure it is correct
   - Add debugging statements to the function to inspect the image format and mode

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```
