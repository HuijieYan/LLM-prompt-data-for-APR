1. The function is intended to convert the input image to a specific format and size, and return the converted image along with its bytes representation. However, there are a couple of potential issues in the function.

2. The potential error is in the line: `background.paste(image, image)`. This line is trying to paste the image onto the background, but it should be using the correct syntax `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. Additionally, there might be an issue with converting the image to 'RGB' format in the elif statement.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the `paste` function is being used incorrectly, and the 'RGB' conversion might not work as intended.

4. To fix the bug, we can correct the syntax for the `paste` function and handle the 'RGB' conversion differently.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# corrected version of the function
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image) # Handle the image transformation with exif data to ensure proper orientation

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the `paste` function is used with the correct syntax, and the 'RGB' conversion is handled using `ImageOps.exif_transpose` to ensure proper orientation.
