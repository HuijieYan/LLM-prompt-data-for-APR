1. The convert_image function is responsible for converting an image to a specified format and size. It currently has a bug related to the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode.

3. The bug occurs due to the conditional logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The condition to check for image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA' is incorrect, and as a result, the function fails to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which indicates that the converted.getcolors() is not returning the expected result.

4. To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for thumbnail generation should be reviewed to ensure that the image ratio is maintained.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the failing test for the convert_image function should pass successfully.
