The `convert_image` function has a few issues. 

The first issue is in the conditional statement. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image over it. However, it is using the `paste` method incorrectly.

The second issue is that the function does not handle the case when the image mode is 'P'.

The failing test is testing the conversion of images with different modes and sizes. The error message indicates that the first differing element is between the expected list of colors and the actual list of colors after the image conversion for the transparency case with palette.

To fix the issues, we need to correct the image pasting process and handle the 'P' mode as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' or image.mode == 'P':
        image = ImageOps.grayscale(image)

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test.
