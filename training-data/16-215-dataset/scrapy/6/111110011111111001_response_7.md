The buggy function `convert_image` has a couple of issues. 

1. In the first `if` condition, the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', and then creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it. However, it should be checking for image format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', not 'PNG' and 'RGB'.
2. In the first `if` condition, after pasting the image onto the background, it converts the image to 'RGB'. However, it should be setting the mode of the background to 'RGB' after pasting the original image onto it. 
3. The location where `background.paste(image, image)` is incorrect. The second 'image' in the `paste` method should be a tuple representing the position where the image should be pasted onto the background. 

The correction should involve making these changes to the function.

Possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Update the first `if` condition to check for the correct format and mode.
2. Correct the pasting of the image onto the background.
3. Set the mode of the background to 'RGB' after pasting the original image onto it.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
