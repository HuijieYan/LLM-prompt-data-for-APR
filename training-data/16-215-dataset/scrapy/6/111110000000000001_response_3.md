1. The buggy function is a part of the ImagesPipeline class, which is a subclass of FilesPipeline. The function is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format.

2. The potential error is in the section where the image format is checked and converted to RGB if it's not already in that format.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect conversion of the image format to RGB. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function tries to convert it to RGB. However, the implementation is incorrect, resulting in the image not being converted properly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB is done correctly, and that the correct conditions are being checked to identify the image format and mode.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the conversion of RGBA to RGB by using the `Image.new()` and `paste()` methods correctly. Additionally, we have also adjusted the condition to check for RGB mode instead of specific image formats.
