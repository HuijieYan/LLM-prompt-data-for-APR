The issue with the provided function is that it incorrectly handles the conversion of images and the generation of thumbnails. 

The failing tests show that the `convert_image` function is not producing the expected output in some cases, which is likely due to incorrect conversion logic inside the function.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function should be modified to correctly handle the conversion and thumbnail generation for different image formats and modes. The main issue is with the incorrect logic to handle PNG images with RGBA mode.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import ImagesPipeline

class CustomImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        # Convert RGBA PNG images to RGB
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function should resolve the issues highlighted in the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
