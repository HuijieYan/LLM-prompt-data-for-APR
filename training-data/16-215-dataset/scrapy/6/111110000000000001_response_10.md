1. The buggy function `convert_image` is a method within the `ImagesPipeline` class which is meant to implement image thumbnail generation logic.

2. The potential error location in the function is the conditional statement checking for the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statement in the `convert_image` function is checking if the image is in the 'PNG' format and has an 'RGBA' mode, and if so, it attempts to convert the image to 'RGB' format. However, the problem lies in the `background.paste(image, image)` line. This line should be changed to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to correctly paste the RGBA image onto the new background.

4. The possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
   - Fix the conditional statement to correctly handle RGBA images and convert them to RGB.
   - Properly handle the image pasting and conversion process.
   - Ensure that the thumbnail generation and image saving processes are working as expected.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement has been fixed to handle RGBA images correctly, the image pasting process has been adjusted, and the `image.convert('RGB')` line has been updated.
