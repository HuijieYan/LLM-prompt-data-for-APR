The bug in the `convert_image` function is that in the first `if` statement, it is checking for the format to be 'PNG' and mode to be 'RGBA', and then it is handling the conversion. However, if the format is 'PNG' but the mode is not 'RGBA', it does not handle the conversion, which leads to incorrect behavior. Additionally, in the first `if` statement, `background.paste(image, image)` should be replaced with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to correctly paste the image onto the background.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function needs to handle the case where the format is 'PNG' but the mode is not 'RGBA' by converting it to 'RGB'. Additionally, the `background.paste` method needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode != 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        else:
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected `convert_image` function now handles the case where the format is 'PNG' but the mode is not 'RGBA', and also correctly pastes the image onto the background. The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided for the test cases.
