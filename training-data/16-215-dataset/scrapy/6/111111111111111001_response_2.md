The buggy function has several issues that can be identified from the failing test cases and error messages. 

1. The first issue is that the function is not handling PNG images with an RGBA mode properly. It has a condition to check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, but it converts the entire image to RGB, losing the alpha channel.

2. The second issue is that the function doesn't handle PNG images with a palette mode (P) correctly. It appears to be treating them as RGBA images and converting them to RGB.

3. The function is saving the image as a JPEG without considering the original image format.

To fix these issues, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA and palette modes, and also consider the original image format when saving.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            # Convert to RGB and apply the alpha composite
            image = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            image.paste(background, (0, 0), background)
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        # Save the image with the original format
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In this corrected code, we create a new RGBA image with a white background, then paste the original image on top, preserving the alpha channel. We also use `ImageOps.fit` to create a thumbnail with the correct aspect ratio. Finally, we save the image using the original format.

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
