The bug in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the input `size` when it is provided. The function also doesn't handle the case where the image format is already 'JPEG' and mode is 'RGB' and unnecessarily converts it.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB' and skip the conversion in that case. It also needs to correctly handle the provided `size` parameter and maintain the correct format of the image.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    from PIL import Image
    from io import BytesIO

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function will now handle the specified cases as per the expected input/output variable information provided.
