The issue in the provided function is the way it handles the image conversion. The function convert_image() currently has a conditional to check if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', but it fails to correctly handle the conversion in this case, leading to failing tests.

The failing test is testing the image conversion under different scenarios, such as converting an image to a thumbnail and handling image formats like PNG and JPEG, and testing whether the expected image format and size are preserved after the conversion. The error message indicates that the specific failing assertion is related to the colors of the converted image.

To fix the bug, the function convert_image() needs to be modified to ensure that the image is correctly handled based on its format and mode. Additionally, the function should be able to convert the image to a thumbnail while preserving the image's ratio.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to revise the conditional statement to check for the image format and mode, and apply the respective conversion logic based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the convert_image() function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, ImageFile.Parser().parse(buf)
```

With these modifications, the function should now correctly handle image conversion based on its format and mode, and also preserve the image ratio when applying a size for thumbnail conversion.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
