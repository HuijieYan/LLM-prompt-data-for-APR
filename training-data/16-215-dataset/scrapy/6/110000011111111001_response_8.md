The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement that checks for image format and mode. This is where the conversion to RGB for PNG with RGBA mode is expected to occur, but it is not happening correctly.

The bug's cause is that the conversion to RGB for PNG images with RGBA mode is not being handled correctly. This is evident from the failing test and error message, which shows that the color values are not being converted as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that PNG images with RGBA mode are converted to RGB and that the transparency information is handled properly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the thumbnail creation is also functioning correctly for all image types.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image over the white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the composite image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        # Convert other types of images to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the image to a buffer
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code should now handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB correctly, as well as properly resize the images when a size parameter is provided. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
