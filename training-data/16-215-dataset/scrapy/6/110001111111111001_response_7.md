The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:

1. The condition to check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA is incorrect. The current condition checks for PNG and RGBA, but should check for PNG and RGBA channel count equal to 4.
2. When pasting the image onto a new background, the correct syntax for the `paste` method is `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
3. Saving the image as JPEG without quality specification can cause issues in certain JPEG interpreters due to the lack of quality metadata.
4. The function doesn't return the correct values for the converted image and the BytesIO buffer.

To fix the issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA' and image.getextrema()[3][1] != 255:
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now correctly checks for PNG images with an alpha channel, uses the proper paste method syntax, sets the quality parameter when saving the image as JPEG, and returns the correct values for the converted image and the BytesIO buffer.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
