The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if image.format == 'PNG'` which converts the image to RGB mode, regardless of its mode (RGBA) at the beginning.

The bug's cause is that the function does not properly handle RGBA images with the PNG format. Additionally, the function is not handling the conversion of images to the JPEG format correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle RGBA images with the PNG format and also handle the conversion of images to the JPEG format correctly. The function needs to check for the image format before performing any conversions and handle RGBA images separately.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected code addresses the issues identified with the original function. It properly handles RGBA images with the PNG format and correctly converts images to the JPEG format. This should now satisfy all the provided test cases and expectations.
