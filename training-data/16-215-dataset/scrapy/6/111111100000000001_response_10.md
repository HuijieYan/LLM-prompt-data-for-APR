1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the Image thumbnail generation logic.
3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `convert_image` function is attempting to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB and making thumbnails, but there is a potential error in the logic.
   (b). The `ImagesPipeline` class contains methods for processing and generating thumbnails for images.
   (c). The related functions are responsible for image processing and saving thumbnails.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use exception handling to handle image conversion errors.
   - Ensure that the image format and mode are properly handled before processing.
   - Use a more robust method for creating thumbnails.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
