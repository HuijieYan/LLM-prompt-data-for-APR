The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to RGB format and save it as a JPEG. The bug in the function is causing the failing test to produce the error message: "Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]".

The issue is with the logic in the `convert_image` function, specifically in the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The function creates a new background with a white color and pastes the image onto it. However, the call to `image.paste(image, image)` seems to be incorrect and does not actually paste the image onto the background.

The failing test `test_convert_image` is testing different scenarios and expected results for converting images, including keeping image ratio and testing transparency with different color modes.

To fix the bug, the logic for pasting the image onto the background needs to be corrected, and the conversion to RGB format also needs to be adjusted.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `paste` method of the `background` image to properly paste the original image onto the background without using `image.paste(image, image)`. Additionally, the conversion to RGB format should handle both RGBA and other modes properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test and no longer produce the error message.
