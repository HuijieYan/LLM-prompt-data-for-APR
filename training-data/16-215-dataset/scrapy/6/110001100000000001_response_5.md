1. The buggy function is supposed to convert an image to a different format and resize it if needed. The potential error is likely in the image conversion process or when handling different image modes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the image conversion process and handling different image modes.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function may encounter an error when converting the image to a different format or when handling different image modes.
   (b). The related functions may not properly handle the conversion and resizing of the image, leading to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check and handle all possible image modes and formats.
   b. Use error handling to catch any exceptions during image conversion or resizing.
   c. Ensure the image is properly resized before saving it to the buffer.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The `paste` function is used to properly paste the image onto the background in the PNG RGBA case.
- The `format` parameter is explicitly specified when calling the `save` method to avoid any format-related issues.
- The `seek(0)` method is used to move the buffer's position back to the beginning before returning it.
