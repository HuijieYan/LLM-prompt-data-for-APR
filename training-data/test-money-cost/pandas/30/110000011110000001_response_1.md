1. The buggy function is supposed to parse a column in an ndarray-like format into a date column. It attempts to coerce objects in Epoch or ISO formats and integer/float in Epoch formats. The failing test is trying to read a JSON string into a series but fails with a TypeError stating that a boolean is not convertible to datetime. This suggests that the function is attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not possible.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` where it tries to convert the `new_data` to a datetime.

3. The buggy function fails because it attempts to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible. The failing test is expecting a series of boolean values, but the function is trying to parse them into datetime, causing a TypeError.

4. To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input data contains boolean values and handle them accordingly before attempting to convert to datetime. Potential approaches for fixing the bug include adding a condition to handle boolean values before the conversion, or returning an error if the input data contains boolean values, as it cannot be converted to datetime. 

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # handle boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == np.bool_:
        return data, False  # return False as it cannot be converted to datetime

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd._libs.tslibs.nattype.iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code handles boolean values and returns False if the input data contains boolean values, as they cannot be converted to datetime.
