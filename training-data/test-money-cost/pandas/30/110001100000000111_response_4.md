1. Analyzing the function and its relationship with the related functions and the GitHub issue:
   The function _try_convert_to_date is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column. The GitHub issue relates to the function pd.read_json, which is used to read a JSON file into a pandas object. The specific issue is that when using the function with typ="series" and a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps or an exception instead of a series of bools.

2. Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:
   The potential error location is within the try-except block that attempts to convert the data to int64 if its dtype is "object".

3. Elucidating the bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to convert the data to int64 if its dtype is "object", but it does not handle bool values correctly.
   (b). This function is related to the functionality of the pd.read_json function, which is supposed to read the JSON list of bools into a pandas series, but it currently doesn't handle it properly.
   (c). The GitHub issue details that the expected output should be a series of bools, and that the behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case, where it works correctly.

4. Suggesting possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   To fix the bug, the function _try_convert_to_date should be modified to correctly handle bool values and ensure that when used with pd.read_json with typ="series", it returns a series of bools.

5. Presenting the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaT
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

# The corrected function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
``` 

The corrected code now includes an additional check for bool values, and it will return the data without conversion and a False flag if the data type is bool. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
