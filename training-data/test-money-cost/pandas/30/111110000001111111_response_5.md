The issue seems to be with the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `Parser` class. The function is trying to convert data to a date column but is not handling boolean data correctly, resulting in incorrect output.

The problem seems to be caused by the code that is coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. This code is not handling boolean data correctly and is returning incorrect values.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data correctly and return the expected output. We also need to handle the case where the data is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `Parser` class:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import RangeIndex, Series
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype, is_integer_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False

        if is_integer_dtype(data):
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, unit='s')
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                return data, False

        return data, False
```

This corrected code should handle the boolean data correctly and return the expected output for the given test cases. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub by returning a Series of boolean values for boolean data.
