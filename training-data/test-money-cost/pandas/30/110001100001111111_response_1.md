The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` is that it is incorrectly converting boolean values to timestamps instead of returning a Pandas Series of booleans. This is causing the function to raise a TypeError.

The error occurs when converting a Pandas Series of boolean values to dates, as the function incorrectly treats boolean values as dates.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle boolean values and return a Pandas Series of booleans instead of trying to convert them to dates.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Return the data as is, without trying to convert to dates
    return data, False
```

This corrected code will address the issue reported in the GitHub issue, returning a Pandas Series of boolean values instead of trying to convert them to dates.
