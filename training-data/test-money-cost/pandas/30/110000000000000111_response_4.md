1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue because it attempts to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column, which is causing unexpected behavior when the input is a series of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for converting the input data to datetime. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where the user expects the output to be a series of boolean values but is instead getting a series of timestamps or an exception.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert boolean values into datetime, which is not the expected behavior for the input data. This is causing the unexpected output when the input is a series of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check if the input data is boolean, and if so, return the input data as is (without attempting to convert to datetime).
   - Update the function to handle different data types appropriately, ensuring that boolean values are not mistakenly converted to datetime.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a new condition to check if the input data is a boolean series, and if so, it returns the input data as is without attempting to convert it to datetime. This update should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
