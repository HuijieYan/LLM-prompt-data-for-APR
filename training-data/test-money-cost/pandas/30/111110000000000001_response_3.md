1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class, which is responsible for converting data into a date column. The function checks if the data is empty, attempts to convert object types to int64, ignores numbers that are out of range, and then tries to convert the data to a datetime object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic used to handle conversion of object types to int64 and in the checks for numbers that are out of range.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the mishandling of object types and the checks for out of range numbers. The logic for converting object types to int64 seems incomplete, and the checks for out of range numbers are not effectively handling all cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include revising the logic for converting object types to int64 to ensure all cases are handled properly, and improving the checks for out of range numbers to accurately identify and handle them.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In this corrected code, the handling of object types and the checks for out of range numbers have been improved to address the potential issues that were causing the bug.
