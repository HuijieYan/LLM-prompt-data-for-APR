The issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is causing the TypeError. The function is trying to handle different data types and coerce them into a date column, but it doesn't differentiate between boolean values and other data types.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling boolean values properly when trying to convert them to datetime.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to add a check for boolean values in the `_try_convert_to_date` function and handle them separately. This would prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle boolean values and prevent the TypeError from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and also pass the failing test.
