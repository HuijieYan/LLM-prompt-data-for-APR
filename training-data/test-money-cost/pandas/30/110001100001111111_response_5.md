The issue seems to stem from the `_try_convert_to_date` function which is incorrectly parsing boolean data as dates. This is causing the function to return unexpected results and raise a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

The potential error location within the function is the conversion of boolean data to dates, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle boolean data differently and avoid treating it as dates. This can be achieved by checking the datatype of the input data and returning the unmodified data with a False flag, indicating that the parsing was not successful.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected code should now handle boolean data appropriately, returning the unmodified data with a False flag to indicate that parsing was not successful. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
