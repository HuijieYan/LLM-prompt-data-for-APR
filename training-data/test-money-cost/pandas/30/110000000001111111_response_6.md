The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is likely located within the logic for converting object types to date. The function attempts to convert the data to int64 dtype if it is of type "object" and then checks for out-of-range numbers. However, the specific logic for converting object types to date seems to be causing the issue based on the GitHub issue provided.

The bug's cause is likely a result of incorrect conversion of boolean values to datetime. The function should return a Series of boolean values, but it is returning a Series of timestamps instead, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for converting object types to date needs to be adjusted to handle boolean values correctly. Additionally, the logic for checking out-of-range numbers also needs to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core.nanops import iNaT
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaTType
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            if new_data.dtype == 'int64' and (new_data == 0 | new_data == 1):
                new_data = new_data.astype('bool')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if isna(new_data._values) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data._values == iNaT) | (new_data.dtype == iNaT) | (new_data.dtype is NaTType()):
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, it should now correctly handle boolean values and return a Series of boolean values as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
