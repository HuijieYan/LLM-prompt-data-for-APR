1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert a boolean series to a date format, which is causing a `TypeError` because boolean values cannot be converted to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)`, which is attempting to convert the data to datetime without checking if it is already in a valid format.

3. The bug's cause is due to the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not valid. This is evident from the failing test that expects a Series of boolean values, but instead, it's encountering a `TypeError` when attempting to convert the boolean values to datetime. The GitHub issue further illustrates the problem and the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the data type before attempting to convert to datetime, and return the original data if it's a boolean type.
   - Update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values gracefully, potentially by returning a boolean series without attempting to convert it to datetime.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":  # Check for boolean type
        return data, False  # Return the original data and indicate parsing was not successful

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will check for boolean type, and if the data is boolean, it will return the original data and indicate that parsing was not successful. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and also pass the failing test.
