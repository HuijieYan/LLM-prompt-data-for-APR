1. The problematic function is `_try_convert_to_date` which is a method within the `Parser` class. It is responsible for attempting to convert the data into a date column. The failing test is testing the `read_json` function with `typ="series"`, which triggers the problematic behavior in `_try_convert_to_date`. The error message indicates that a boolean value is not convertible to datetime, which is the source of the bug. The GitHub issue reflects the same problem and provides details on the expected output and the versions of pandas and other related libraries.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the line where the conversion to datetime is attempted. This is likely where the boolean value is causing the exception.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert the input data to a date column.
   (b). The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` method, which is used in the `read_json` function.
   (c). The failing test function is attempting to read a JSON with boolean values as a series, triggering the problematic behavior and generating the error message.
   (d). The error message indicates that a boolean value is not convertible to datetime, which is the source of the bug.
   (e). The GitHub issue further elaborates on the problem, its expected output, and the environment in which it occurs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the data type of the input to `_try_convert_to_date` and handle boolean values differently.
   (b). Implement a conditional check to handle boolean values and return the original data as a boolean series if encountered.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    # handle boolean values separately
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return pd.Series(new_data), True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for the boolean data type and returns a boolean series if the input data contains boolean values, thus resolving the issue indicated in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
