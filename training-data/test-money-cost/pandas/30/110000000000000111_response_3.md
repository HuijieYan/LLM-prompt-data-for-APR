1. The buggy function is supposed to convert a ndarray into a date column, but it is causing issues when the input data is of type bool. This relates to the GitHub issue because when using pd.read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools, it results in an unexpected output of timestamps or raises an exception instead of returning a Series of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of data to datetime using the to_datetime function. This is where the function is unable to handle bool values properly and results in the unexpected output.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling bool values properly and does not have a specific case for converting bool values to datetime. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, which explains how using pd.read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in an unexpected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a specific case to handle bool values and return a Series of bools instead of trying to convert them to datetime.
   - Checking the data type before attempting any conversion and handling bool values separately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # handle bool values separately
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a specific case to handle bool values separately and return them as is, without attempting to convert them to datetime. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
