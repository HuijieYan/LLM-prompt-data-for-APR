The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into a date column, but it is converting boolean values into timestamps, causing a `TypeError` when it encounters a boolean. This behavior is not consistent with the `typ="frame"` case or the expected output, which should be a Series of boolean values.

The root cause of the issue appears to be the incorrect handling of input data types. The function does not differentiate between different data types or handle boolean values properly when converting to datetime.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean data separately and ensure that it returns a Series of boolean values rather than converting them to datetime.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False

        return new_data, True
```

The corrected function now properly handles boolean data separately and returns the original data with a boolean flag indicating whether the conversion was successful.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub, ensuring that the `read_json` function returns a Series of boolean values when `typ="series"`.
