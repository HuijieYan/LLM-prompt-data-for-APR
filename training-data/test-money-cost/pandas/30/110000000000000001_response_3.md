1. The buggy function is trying to convert data into a date format, but there are several issues with the implementation. It uses undefined functions and variables such as `isna`, `iNaT`, `self.date_unit`, `self.min_stamp`, and `to_datetime`. It also has issues with the logic flow, such as returning `data, False` at the beginning of the function without actually converting the data.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the usage of undefined functions and variables, as well as the incorrect logic flow that prevents proper data conversion.

3. The bug's cause is mainly due to the incorrect usage of undefined functions and variables, as well as the flawed logic flow that prevents the function from properly converting the data into a date format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the undefined functions and variables such as `isna`, `iNaT`, `self.date_unit`, `self.min_stamp`, and `to_datetime`.
   - Implement the data conversion logic in a way that properly handles different data types and formats.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data)
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            np.isnan(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        
    return new_data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- Imported `numpy` and `pandas` as they are used within the function.
- Replaced `isna` with `np.isnan`.
- Replaced `iNaT` with `pd.NaT`.
- Replaced `to_datetime` with `pd.to_datetime`.
- Used the correct logic flow to properly handle data conversion and return the result.
