1. The buggy function is part of a class called `Parser`. It seems to be a method for converting data into date format. The function contains some logic for parsing different date formats and handling errors during the conversion process.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for converting data of dtype "object" to "int64", as well as in the date parsing and error handling logic.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of date dtype conversions and error checking, leading to incorrect date parsing and returning of the boolean value.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Verify the logic for converting data of dtype "object" to "int64" and handle any type conversion errors properly.
   - Review the logic for date parsing and error handling, making sure that the correct date units are being used and that error handling is implemented properly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the `data` variable is being properly handled in the `try_convert_to_date` method. The logic for converting dtype "object" to "int64" has been fixed, and the date parsing and error handling logic has been reviewed and updated.
