Based on the expected and actual input/output variable information provided, it seems that the function is failing to return the expected new_data and in_range values. The bug is likely located in the logic that is supposed to handle the conversion and range checking of the new_data variable.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the conversion of data types and the range checking. The function is not correctly converting the `data` parameter to the required data type and is not performing the range check as expected.

To fix the bug, the code for handling the data type conversion and range checking needs to be updated to ensure that the new_data variable is correctly converted to the required data type and the range check is performed as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser:
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The corrected function uses the correct logic to convert the data to the required data type and performs the range check as expected. This satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
