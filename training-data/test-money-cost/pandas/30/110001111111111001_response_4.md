The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to parse a date from input data. It checks if the input `data` is of type "object", and if so, attempts to convert it to type "int64". It then checks if the data is within a certain range and attempts to convert it to a datetime object. If it fails, it continues with the next date unit.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it to a Series, which then triggers the attempt to convert the boolean values to datetime.

The error message indicates that the boolean values cannot be converted to datetime, which is expected since the input data is not actually representing dates. This suggests that the function does not handle non-date data properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-date data appropriately. We can check the data type before attempting to convert it, and if it's not in a date format, we can return indicating that parsing was not successful.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            # ignore numbers that are out of range
            if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    isna(new_data._values)
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                    | (new_data._values == iNaT)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False
                return data, True

    return data, False
```

This version of the function now properly handles non-date data by returning False when it cannot convert the data to a date. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
