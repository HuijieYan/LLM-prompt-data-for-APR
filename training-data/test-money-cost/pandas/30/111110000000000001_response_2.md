1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class. It is supposed to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of different data types and the parsing of the date columns.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be improper handling of data types and errors in the parsing process within the _try_convert_to_date function. There may also be issues with handling exceptions and returning the correct boolean value.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Check the data type of the input and convert it if necessary before parsing.
   - Handle exceptions properly and ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value for successful parsing.
   - Verify the logic for checking if numbers are out of range and ensure it is working as intended.
   - Check the date_unit attribute and its usage within the function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(data) | (data > self.min_stamp) | (data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            pass

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", format="%Y-%m-%d")
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            pass

        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the data type checking and conversion have been simplified. The parsing process has been improved by using the to_datetime function with the specified date_unit and format. The handling of exceptions has also been enhanced to ensure proper error handling and boolean return values.
