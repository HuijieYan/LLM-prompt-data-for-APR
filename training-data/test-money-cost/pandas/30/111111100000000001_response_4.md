1. The buggy function is called _try_convert_to_date and it is part of the Parser class. It is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column. The function tries to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats and returns a boolean if parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the try-except block where data is being converted to int64. There might also be issues with the comparison and assignment of new_data.

3. The bug's cause could be due to improper handling of data types and comparisons within the function. The buggy class, Parser, may not be handling the conversion to date and the comparison of data types properly. There might also be issues with the related functions used within the _try_convert_to_date function, such as astype, isna, to_datetime, etc.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly handle the conversion of object types to int64 in a try-except block
   - Check for data types and handle comparisons properly
   - Ensure that related functions are being used correctly within the _try_convert_to_date function
   - Use appropriate error handling to ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, we have made some changes to properly handle the conversion of object types to int64 by using new_data instead of data. We also fixed the comparison and assignment of in_range and new_data. Additionally, we adjusted the usage of related functions such as isna and to_datetime to ensure proper handling and exception catching.
