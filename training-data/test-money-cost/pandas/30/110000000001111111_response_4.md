The issue with the buggy function is that it is attempting to convert boolean values into date/time values, which is not the expected behavior and is causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the function is checking for date units and attempting to convert the data into date/time values, even when the data is not in a date/time format. This is causing the function to return incorrect results when the input data is not in a date/time format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to only attempt to convert the data to date/time format if it is actually in a non-integer format. For boolean or integer data, the function should simply return the input data without attempting to convert it.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the data type of the input data and only convert it to date/time format if it is of type 'object', indicating that it might be in a date/time format. Otherwise, the function should simply return the input data without any conversion.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif not issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        return data, False
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    in_range = (
        isna(data._values)
        | (data > self.min_stamp)
        | (data._values == iNaT)
    )
    if not in_range.all():
        return data, False

    return data, True
```

With this correction, the function will only attempt to convert the data to date/time format if it is of type 'object', and will simply return the input data without any conversion if it is already a boolean or an integer. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
