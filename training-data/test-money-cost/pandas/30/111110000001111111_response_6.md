Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the logic for converting the data to a date column. It is incorrectly identifying non-date data as dates and attempting to convert them, leading to the unexpected behavior.

Bug cause: The function is incorrectly handling non-date data as date values and attempting to convert them, leading to the unexpected output of dates instead of boolean values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the data is already in a boolean format and return it as is.
2. If the data is not in boolean format, try to convert it to boolean format instead of date format.
3. Handle non-boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them to dates.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = data.astype("bool")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected code checks if the data is already in boolean format and returns it as is. If not, it attempts to convert it to boolean format and returns the result. This should resolve the issue and return a Pandas Series of boolean values as expected. It also avoids the unnecessary attempt to convert non-boolean values to dates.
