# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute. This suggests that there might be an issue with the size of the values being processed in the function, which could be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message indicates a RuntimeWarning for an overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute. This error is related to numerical operations and may help in identifying a potential issue in the nonsingular function.
Conclusion: Yes.
