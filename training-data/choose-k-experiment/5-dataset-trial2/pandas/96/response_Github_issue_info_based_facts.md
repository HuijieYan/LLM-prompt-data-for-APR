## Response 1
Justification: The GitHub issue message is related to using date_range with CustomBusinessHour and holidays, which is not directly related to the buggy function's logic.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Justification: The GitHub issue message provides information about the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays with `CustomBusinessHour`. This is relevant as the buggy function `apply` seems to be related to business hours and date/time calculations, which aligns with the issue reported.
Conclusion: Yes.
