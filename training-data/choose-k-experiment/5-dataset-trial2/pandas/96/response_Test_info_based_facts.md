## Response 1
Justification: The error message indicates a problem validating the frequency, which may be related to how the `apply` function handles and adjusts the datetime input. It seems that the bug in the `apply` function might be causing the frequency validation issue.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message provides information about the specific line where an error occurred within the function, along with the context in which the error occurred. It also highlights the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, which could be relevant to understanding the bug in the function.
Conclusion: Yes.
