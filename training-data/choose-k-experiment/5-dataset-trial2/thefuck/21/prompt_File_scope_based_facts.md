Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
