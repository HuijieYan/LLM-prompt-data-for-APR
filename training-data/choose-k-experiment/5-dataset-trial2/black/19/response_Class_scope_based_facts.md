## Response 1
Justification: The method signatures provided are not relevant to fixing the bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function. The provided method signatures are for a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, but they do not directly address the logic within the _maybe_empty_lines function itself.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signatures provide information about the purpose and behavior of the _maybe_empty_lines method, which is to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
Conclusion: Yes.
