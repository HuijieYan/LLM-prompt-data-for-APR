## Response 1
Justification: The method signature of the _maybe_empty_lines function is provided, including the type of input parameter and the return type. The description of the EmptyLineTracker class is also given, explaining the purpose of the method and the assumptions it makes.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signature for _maybe_empty_lines() specifies that it takes a 'self' parameter, indicating that it is a method of a class. The method also takes a 'current_line' parameter of type Line, and returns a Tuple[int, int].
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signature of the _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int] suggests that the function takes in a Line object and returns a tuple of two integers. This information is crucial for understanding the input and output of the function, which is essential in identifying any potential issues or mismatches with the data types or values being used.
Conclusion: Yes.
