# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The provided function signatures such as is_import, is_decorator, is_class, is_def, is_flow_control, and is_yield are relevant to the conditions and checks in the buggy function's source code. These functions are likely used to determine certain properties of the current or previous line, which could be crucial in understanding and debugging the behavior of the function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to checking whether a line is an import, a decorator, a class, a function definition, a flow control statement, or a yield statement. These are directly related to the conditions and logic present in the buggy function, as they are used to determine the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to operations performed within the buggy function, such as determining if a line is an import, a decorator, a class, a function definition, a flow control statement, or a yield statement. These functions will help in determining the context of the current line and making decisions based on it within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.
