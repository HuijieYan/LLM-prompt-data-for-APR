# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The error message indicates that there is a RuntimeWarning for an overflow encountered in scalar subtract and a RuntimeWarning for overflow encountered in scalar absolute, both of which relate to the arithmetic operations within the `nonsingular` function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" along with a specific line in the `nonsingular` function where the warning is triggered. This gives a clear indication of where the bug may be and the nature of the issue, which can be valuable in identifying and fixing the bug.

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The test code and error message provided indicate potential overflow issues with the function, specifically relating to the calculations involving the 'maxabsvalue' variable. This points to a possible flaw in the handling of extreme values and could help identify the root cause of the buggy function.

Conclusion: Yes.
