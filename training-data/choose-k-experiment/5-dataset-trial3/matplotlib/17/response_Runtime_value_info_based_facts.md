# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The runtime values of the input parameters and variables are directly related to the calculations and conditional checks within the function. The values of vmin, vmax, expander, tiny, and increasing directly impact the conditional statements and calculations in the function. The variable runtime values of swapped and maxabsvalue are also directly impacted by the input parameters.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The runtime variable values provided, including the input parameter values and the variables before the function return, are all directly involved in the calculations and conditions of the buggy function. These values are used for comparisons, calculations, and branching logic within the function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The runtime variable values include the input parameter values and types, as well as the intermediate variable values and types before the function return. These values can help to identify the specific conditions and calculations that lead to the bug in the function.
Conclusion: Yes.
