## Response 1
Justification: The github issue message provides a clear example of unexpected behavior in the CustomBusinessHour frequency when adding holidays, which seems to be similar to the issue in the buggy function's apply method.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The issue is related to the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, which is similar to the context of the buggy function related to adjusting business hours with datetime. The issue description also provides examples of the unexpected behavior and a workaround that works fine. This information could potentially help in identifying the root cause of the bug in the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The github issue mentions a problem with date_range when using periods and adding holidays, which could be related to the CustomBusinessHour frequency behavior. This could potentially be useful in understanding if the issue is related to the behavior of the CustomBusinessHour function or the holidays parameter.
Conclusion: Yes.
