# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The corresponding test code and error message provide valuable information about the specific error encountered in the buggy function. The error message highlights that an IndexError occurred in the line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'". This indicates that the split() method is not providing the expected result, leading to the IndexError when trying to access the second element of the resulting list.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided test code and error message indicate that the bug in the 'match' function is related to an IndexError, which occurs when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list.
