## Response 1
Justification: The test code provides specific scenarios and expected outcomes for the `table_exists` function, including different tables and partitions, as well as an issue with case insensitivity. The error message also shows which specific test cases are failing and provides insight into the expected and actual results.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The test code and error message highlight specific scenarios where the table_exist function is being tested with different input and show the corresponding expected outcomes and actual outcomes. This can help in identifying the specific scenarios where the function is failing and why it is failing. 
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message provides valuable insight into the specific failing test case, indicating that the assertion of the `table_exists` function returning True at a certain point is failing.
Conclusion: Yes.
