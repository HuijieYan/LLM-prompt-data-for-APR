The potential error location in the buggy function is identified in the calculation of `max_allowed` and `newlines`.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect assignment and manipulation of `max_allowed` and `newlines` variables based on conditional checks, which leads to incorrect return values.

Approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the conditional logic and variable assignments in the function to ensure that the correct values are being assigned based on the conditions.
2. Adding explicit checks for the conditions and adjusting the values of `max_allowed` and `newlines` accordingly.
3. Confirming that the relationships with the related functions (`is_import`, `is_decorator`, etc.) are correctly handled and do not interfere with the expected behavior of `_maybe_empty_lines`.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the logic for assigning values to `max_allowed` and `newlines` has been adjusted based on the conditional checks and returned values, ensuring that the incorrect values are no longer being returned, which should address the bug and align the function with the expected input/output variable information.
