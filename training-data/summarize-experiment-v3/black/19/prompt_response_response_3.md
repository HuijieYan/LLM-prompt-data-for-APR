Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect logic in determining the values to return. Specifically, the cases where `max_allowed` and `newlines` are determined do not accurately follow the conditions specified. This is likely due to incorrect conditional statements and variable assignment within the function.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements within the function need to be carefully evaluated and adjusted to accurately reflect the intended logic.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code aligns the conditional statements and variable assignments with the expected logic, ensuring that the function returns the correct values for `max_allowed` and `newlines` based on the input conditions and the intended behavior. The bug should now be fixed, and the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` in the `test_black.py` file should pass without any errors.
