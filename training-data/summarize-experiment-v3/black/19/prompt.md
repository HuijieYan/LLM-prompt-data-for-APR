## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_19/black.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Related functions in the same file and not in the same class as the buggy function include:

- `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None`
- `is_decorator(self) -> bool`
- `is_import(self) -> bool`
- `is_class(self) -> bool`
- `is_def(self) -> bool`
- `is_flow_control(self) -> bool`
- `is_yield(self) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=True) -> None`

These functions likely have interactions with the buggy function, `_maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]`, but without knowing the specifics of their implementation, it's difficult to determine exactly how they are related. The presence of these functions indicates a complexity and interconnectedness in the codebase that may contribute to the bug in `_maybe_empty_lines`.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` in the `test_black.py` file throws an AssertionError in the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error is caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The `actual` output is missing some empty lines and does not match the expected output. The error message provides a detailed comparison between the two outputs, showing the specific differences.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: current_line.depth (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: max_allowed (value: 2, type: int)
Rational: for this input, the function is supposed to return different values based on the condition of current_line.depth, but it always returns the value 2, which is incorrect.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In case 1, the value of max_allowed is expected to be 2, but the buggy function returns 1, indicating a discrepancy in the output. In case 6, the expected value of newlines is 2, but the function returns a value of 0, which is also a discrepancy. These discrepancies highlight potential issues in the function's logic and need to be addressed in order to fix the bug. Additionally, other discrepancies can be identified based on the detailed cases provided.
