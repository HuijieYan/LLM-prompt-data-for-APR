The potential error location within the buggy function is near the beginning, where `max_allowed` is set to 1, then conditionally changed to 2. There's a subsequent min comparison where `before` is re-assigned, which might lead to incorrect values being used. It's possible that the code is not correctly handling the different conditions and their expected outcomes.

The bug's cause stems from the conditional logic that sets the value for `max_allowed` and `newlines`. It seems that in some cases, the correct value isn't being assigned based on the input conditions. This could be due to mutability of the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` along with their conditional reassignment. The existing logic for the conditions might not be handling all cases properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, you could consider restructuring the conditional logic in the function. Care should be taken to appropriately handle the different conditions and ensure that the correct values are assigned to `max_allowed` and `newlines` based on the input parameters and their corresponding requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
