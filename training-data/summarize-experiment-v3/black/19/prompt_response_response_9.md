The potential error in the buggy function lies in how it assigns the value of `max_allowed`. It should return a value of 2 when `current_line.depth == 0`, but it always assigns the value of 2, leading to discrepancies in the output.

The bug's cause can be traced back to the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The initial value of `max_allowed` is set to 1, but the subsequent condition that checks `current_line.depth == 0` should modify `max_allowed` to 2, which does not happen due to the incorrect assignment of the value.

To fix this bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be modified to correctly assign the value of `max_allowed` based on the condition of `current_line.depth`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this fix, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now return the correct values based on the conditions specified, thereby resolving the bug.
