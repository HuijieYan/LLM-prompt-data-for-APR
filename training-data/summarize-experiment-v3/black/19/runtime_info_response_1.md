The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: current_line.depth (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: max_allowed (value: 2, type: int)
Rational: for this input, the function is supposed to return different values based on the condition of current_line.depth, but it always returns the value 2, which is incorrect.
