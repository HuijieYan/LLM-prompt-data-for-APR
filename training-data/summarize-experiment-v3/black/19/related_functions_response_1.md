Related functions in the same file and not in the same class as the buggy function include:

- `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None`
- `is_decorator(self) -> bool`
- `is_import(self) -> bool`
- `is_class(self) -> bool`
- `is_def(self) -> bool`
- `is_flow_control(self) -> bool`
- `is_yield(self) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=True) -> None`

These functions likely have interactions with the buggy function, `_maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]`, but without knowing the specifics of their implementation, it's difficult to determine exactly how they are related. The presence of these functions indicates a complexity and interconnectedness in the codebase that may contribute to the bug in `_maybe_empty_lines`.
