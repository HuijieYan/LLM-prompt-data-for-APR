Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the logic for setting the value of `max_allowed` and `newlines` in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Bug Cause:
The incorrect output seems to be caused by the conditional checks for `current_line.depth` not being handled correctly. The value of `max_allowed` is always set to 2, and the value of `newlines` is not being calculated as expected for different conditions.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the conditional check for setting the value of `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Revisit the logic for calculating the value of `newlines` to ensure it aligns with the expected output for different conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the updated function should now handle the various conditions correctly and produce the expected output based on the input provided.
