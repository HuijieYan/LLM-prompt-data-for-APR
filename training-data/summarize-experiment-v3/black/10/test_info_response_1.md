The failing test "test_comment_indentation" in the file "test_black.py" encounters an AssertionError in the "assertFormatEqual" method at line 156. The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual contents, where the expected and actual outcomes mismatch at a comment line within nested if blocks. This points to a discrepancy in formatting between the two contents, indicating a potential bug in the "_partially_consume_prefix" function that handles indentation and comment lines. Specifically, the bug might be related to the handling of comment lines within nested if blocks, causing incorrect formatting.
