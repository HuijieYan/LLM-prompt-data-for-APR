The potential error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines, leading to discrepancies in the output. It seems that the implementation of handling different types of characters, specifically spaces, tabs, and newlines, is not consistent, resulting in unexpected output.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to ensure consistent handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines, and their impact on the current line and the lines list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Non-indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines is made consistent throughout the loop. Additionally, the logic for checking when to return the consumed prefix and the leftover portion is adjusted to ensure correct behavior.

This corrected code aims to address the issues related to inconsistent handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines, and should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
