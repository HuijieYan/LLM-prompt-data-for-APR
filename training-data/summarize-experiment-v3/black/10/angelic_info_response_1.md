In case 1, the expected value of the variable `current_line` is `'    # comment\n'`, but the actual code is creating an empty list `[]`. This discrepancy indicates that the function is not functioning as expected. In case 3, the variable `current_line` is expected to be `'\t'`, but the actual output is an empty string `''`. Similarly, in case 5, the expected value of the variable `current_line` is `'    '`, while the actual output is an empty string `''`. These discrepancies highlight that the function is not producing the correct output in specific cases, and further debugging and modifications are necessary.
