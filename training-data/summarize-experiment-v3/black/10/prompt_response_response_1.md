The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines when processing input prefixes. The outputs of the function do not align with the expected results in specific cases, indicating a potential issue with the processing logic for these characters.

To address this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the indentation and formatting of comment lines within nested if blocks. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adjusting the conditions for handling whitespace characters and tabs, refining the logic for managing newlines, and ensuring the correct output formatting for consumed and leftover portions of the prefix.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    consume_line = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if consume_line:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                consume_line = True
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if consume_line:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            consume_line = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional logic to handle the correct consumption and formatting of prefix lines, especially when encountering newline characters and managing the indentation level. By refining the conditionals and control flow within the function, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent should be resolved. Once this corrected code is implemented, it should be tested to ensure that it appropriately addresses the formatting discrepancy and aligns with the expected results for the provided test cases.
