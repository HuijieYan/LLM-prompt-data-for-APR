The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be causing incorrect handling of comment lines within nested if blocks, leading to incorrect formatting of the code. This is evidenced by the failing test "test_comment_indentation" in the file "test_black.py" and the corresponding error message regarding mismatched expected and actual outcomes when comparing comment line formatting.

The buggy function appears to be incorrectly processing and consuming the prefix string, resulting in discrepancies in the `current_line` and `lines` variables based on different input scenarios involving tabs, newlines, and spaces.

To address this bug, a potential approach could involve revisiting the logic for processing whitespace and newline characters, especially in scenarios involving nested if blocks and comment lines. Additionally, ensuring consistent handling of indentation levels and comment line placement within the code can potentially resolve the formatting discrepancies.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the conditional statements and character concatenation within the `for` loop, the corrected code aims to address the issues related to indentation, comment line processing, and prefix consumption within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This revised approach is intended to accurately handle the prefix string based on the specified column parameter and address the formatting discrepancies observed in the failing test cases.
