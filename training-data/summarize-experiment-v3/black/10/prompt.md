## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_10/blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class method `_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column)`: This function appears to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided column parameter. It seems to handle whitespace, tabs, and newlines to determine when to stop consuming the prefix and return the consumed part along with the leftover portion.

Related functions or method calls:
- None

Overall, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be responsible for processing a prefix string and returning the consumed part along with the leftover portion based on the specified column. However, without the context of related functions or method calls, it is challenging to fully understand the role of this function within the larger codebase.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test "test_comment_indentation" in the file "test_black.py" encounters an AssertionError in the "assertFormatEqual" method at line 156. The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual contents, where the expected and actual outcomes mismatch at a comment line within nested if blocks. This points to a discrepancy in formatting between the two contents, indicating a potential bug in the "_partially_consume_prefix" function that handles indentation and comment lines. Specifically, the bug might be related to the handling of comment lines within nested if blocks, causing incorrect formatting.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
### Case 1
- input parameters: 
  - prefix (value: `'    # comment\n    '`, type: `str`)
  - column (value: 8, type: `int`)
- Output variables: 
  - lines (value: `[]`, type: `list`)
  - current_line (value: `'    # comment\n'`, type: `str`)
Rational: The unexpected result in `current_line` may be affected by the handling of newlines and spaces in the prefix.

### Case 3
- input parameters: 
  - prefix (value: `'\t# comment\n\t'`, type: `str`)
  - column (value: 2, type: `int`)
- Output variables: 
  - lines (value: `[]`, type: `list`)
  - current_line (value: `'\t# comment\n'`, type: `str`)
Rational: Similar to Case 1, the newline and tab characters in the prefix may be causing issues in the output.

### Case 5
- input parameters: 
  - prefix (value: `'\t\t# comment\n\t'`, type: `str`)
  - column (value: 2, type: `int`)
- Output variables: 
  - lines (value: `['\t\t# comment\n']`, type: `list`)
  - current_line (value: `'\t'`, type: `str`)
Rational: The unexpected result in `current_line` and `lines` indicate an issue with the processing of tabs and newlines.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In case 1, the expected value of the variable `current_line` is `'    # comment\n'`, but the actual code is creating an empty list `[]`. This discrepancy indicates that the function is not functioning as expected. In case 3, the variable `current_line` is expected to be `'\t'`, but the actual output is an empty string `''`. Similarly, in case 5, the expected value of the variable `current_line` is `'    '`, while the actual output is an empty string `''`. These discrepancies highlight that the function is not producing the correct output in specific cases, and further debugging and modifications are necessary.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
