Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the handling of whitespace characters and newlines. This may lead to incorrect indentation and formatting, especially for comment lines within nested if blocks.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the handling of whitespace and newline characters in the `prefix` string. The function does not properly account for different combinations of tabs, spaces, and newlines, leading to unexpected output for `current_line` and `lines`. This affects the expected behavior when consuming and separating the prefix based on the specified column.

To fix the bug, it is essential to revise the logic for handling whitespace characters and newlines in the input `prefix` string. This can involve reevaluating the conditional checks for spaces, tabs, and newlines to ensure correct prefix consumption and separation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if not wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # valid character
                current_line += char
                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                # newline encountered after indentation
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected code should address the bug by properly handling the whitespace and newline characters in the prefix string. It separates the consumed part based on the specified column and ensures correct formatting for comment lines within nested if blocks.

By implementing this correction, the function should now pass the failing test "test_comment_indentation," satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
