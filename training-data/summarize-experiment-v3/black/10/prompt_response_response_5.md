The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the handling of indentation and newlines, particularly when encountering comment lines within nested if blocks.

The bug's cause is likely related to how the function processes whitespace characters, tabs, and newlines. The function may not be handling these characters correctly, leading to discrepancies in the output, especially when dealing with comments and nested if blocks.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revisit the logic for processing whitespace, tabs, and newlines to ensure correct handling of comment lines within nested if blocks.
2. Verify that the logic for determining when to stop consuming the prefix and return the consumed part along with the leftover portion is accurate.
3. Consider edge cases, such as the usage of tabs and comments at various indentation levels, to ensure comprehensive handling.

Corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Change from < to <=
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Remove resetting current_column to 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made to ensure proper handling of indentation, tabs, and newlines. Additionally, adjustments have been made to the conditionals for consuming the prefix and returning the consumed part along with the leftover portion.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and ensure that the function processes the prefix string accurately, especially in cases involving comments within nested if blocks and varying levels of indentation.
