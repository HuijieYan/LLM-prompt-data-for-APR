Based on the information provided, the bug in the `info()` function of the Fish shell is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output values. This bug is highlighted by a failing test in the `test_info` function in the `test_fish.py` file, resulting in an AssertionError due to the mismatch.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be updated to ensure the correct version is obtained and returned by the `info()` function. Additionally, the output parsing should be handled correctly to eliminate any discrepancies.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the command used to retrieve the version has been updated to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure the correct version is obtained. The output parsing remains the same to construct the string representing the name and version of the Fish shell. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `info()` function returns the expected version of the Fish shell, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
