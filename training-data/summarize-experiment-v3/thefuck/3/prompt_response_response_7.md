Based on the provided information, the potential error in the `info` function lies in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The current implementation of the function does not return the expected version of the shell, leading to a failing test.

The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `Popen` function to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This results in an unexpected version string that includes the words 'fish, version' in addition to the actual version number.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the command executed by `Popen` to accurately retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the command passed to `Popen` has been modified to 'fish --version' to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without any additional text. This modification ensures that the `info` function returns the correct version of the Fish shell, resolving the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
