## Bug's Location

The potential error location within the buggy function is the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.


## Bug's Cause

(a) The buggy function is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell due to the incorrect command used.
(b) The incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
(c) The failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output.
(d) The error message is an AssertionError showing the mismatch between the expected and actual output.
(e) Actual Input/Output Variable Values:
    - Actual Output: 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'
    - Actual version: '3.5.9'
(f) Expected Input/Output Variable Values:
    - Expected Output: 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
(g) GitHub Issue Information: The issue involves the use of the `thefuck` plugin with Oh-My-Fish, triggering a recursive loop due to the incorrect version retrieval.


## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the function should be updated to handle the retrieved version string appropriately.


## Corrected Code

The corrected code for the `info` function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code uses the `--version` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and then processes the output to obtain the desired version information. This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the expected version of the Fish shell.
