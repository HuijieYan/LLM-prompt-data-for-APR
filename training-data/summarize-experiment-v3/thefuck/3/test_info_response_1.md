The failing test is associated with the `info` function in the `thefuck.shells.fish` module. The error is caused by the assertion failure within the `test_info` method of the test file `tests/shells/test_fish.py` at line 118. It seems that the expected output of `shell.info()` does not match the actual output. Specifically, the expected result is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual result is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the processing of the version information in the `info` function, possibly related to the handling of the output from the Popen call.
