In the provided case, the function info returns the expected version of the Fish Shell. However, the returned version does not match the expected value. The program returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of the expected value, indicating that the function is not working correctly for this case. This discrepancy suggests that the function is not obtaining the correct version of the shell, and further debugging is required to identify and fix the bug.
