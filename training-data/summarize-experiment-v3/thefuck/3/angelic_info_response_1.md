The function 'info' is expected to return the name and version of the current shell, "Fish Shell 3.5.9". However, the current function attempts to retrieve the version by running 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' using Popen, which is not consistent with the expected behavior. The return value is based on the expectance of version directly from the Popen output, "fish, version 3.5.9". The discrepancy arises from the incorrect use of Popen and the way version is read and formatted, indicating that the function is not working as expected.
