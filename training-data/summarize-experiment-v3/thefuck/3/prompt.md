## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```


## Summary of Related Functions

`Popen()` function call: Executes a command in a subshell and returns a tuple containing file objects representing the standard output and error streams of the child process. In this case, it is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

`u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`: Constructs a string representing the name and version of the Fish shell.

The `info()` function is likely intended to return the name and version of the current shell, retrieved using the `Popen()` function to execute a command in the shell. The issue may stem from the way the output is being handled and returned within the function.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test for the `info` method in the Fish shell returns an AssertionError on line 118 due to a mismatch between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This mismatch is caused by the use of the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. The stack trace shows that the failing assertion is within the `test_info` function in the `test_fish.py` file.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant runtime values are:
- version, value: '3.5.9', type: str

Rational: The function is expected to return the name and version of the current shell, but the version value seems to be incorrect. The issue may be related to the command used to retrieve the version or the parsing of the output.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the provided case, the function info returns the expected version of the Fish Shell. However, the returned version does not match the expected value. The program returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of the expected value, indicating that the function is not working correctly for this case. This discrepancy suggests that the function is not obtaining the correct version of the shell, and further debugging is required to identify and fix the bug.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.
