## Potential Error Location
The potential error is likely in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function, leading to an incorrect output.

## Bug's Cause
(a) The `Popen()` function executes the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, this command may not return the expected version value.
(b) The `info()` function was expected to return the name and version of the current shell, but the version value seems to be incorrect.
(c) The failing test for the `info` method in the Fish shell returns an AssertionError due to a mismatch between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
(d) The error message is an AssertionError due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
(e) The actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
(f) The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
(g) The GitHub issue is related to the function 'thefuck -v' triggering a recursive loop due to an issue with the `info()` function. 

## Suggested Approach for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, ensuring that it returns the correct version value.

## Corrected Code
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1].split(' ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the command `['fish', '-v']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and then processes the output to extract the correct version value. This should address the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
