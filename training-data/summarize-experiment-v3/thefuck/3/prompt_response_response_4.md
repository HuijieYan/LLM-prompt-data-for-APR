The bug in the `info` method of the Fish shell in the `thefuck` repository is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The Popen() function is used to execute the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, but it returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of the expected '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be updated to return the correct version string.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method in the `fish.py` file:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen('fish --version', shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` method will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return the expected output, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
