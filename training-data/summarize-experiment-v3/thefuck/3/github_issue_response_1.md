The issue "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function in the `fish.py` file. When Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses the command thefuck -v, it leads to a recursive loop due to a call to the `info` function, which causes the hang during Fish Shell initialization. This behavior has been identified as a bug, and a fix is in progress.
