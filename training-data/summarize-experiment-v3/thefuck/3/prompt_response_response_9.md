The potential error in the `info` function lies in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The current implementation uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' as the command, but it should be 'fish --version' to obtain the correct version string.

The bug's cause is the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be changed to 'fish --version' in the `Popen` call.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell and resolve the issue on GitHub.
