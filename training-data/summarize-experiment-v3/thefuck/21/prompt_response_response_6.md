The bug in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` module is caused by attempting to split the `command.script` without checking if it contains more than one element. This results in an `IndexError` when attempting to access index `1` of the split result.

To fix this bug:
- The `match` function should be updated to check if the split result has at least 2 elements before attempting to access index `1`.
- The function should also check if the first element of the split result is 'git' to ensure it is identifying the correct command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
