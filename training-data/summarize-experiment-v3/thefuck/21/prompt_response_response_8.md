## Bug's cause:

The bug is caused by the `IndexError` occurring on line 8 of the file when the `command.script` is split, and the index `1` is being accessed. This error is indicative of not enough elements available to split, resulting in a list index out of range error. The function checks if the second part of the split script is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr. The input parameters provided are relevant to identifying the potential issue in the logic of the function.

## Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be updated to properly check that the command includes `'stash'` and that the command's standard error includes `'usage:'`. Adjusting the split operation or utilizing a different approach to extract the necessary information would likely resolve the issue.

## The corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The correction involves splitting the `command.script` into parts and checking whether there are more than one part in the split result. Then, it checks if the second part of the split script is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in the command's stderr. This should address the `IndexError` and rectify the logic of the function.
