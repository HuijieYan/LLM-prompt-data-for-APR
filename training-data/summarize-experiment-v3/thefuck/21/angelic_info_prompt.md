Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing runtime information of a program to identify a bug. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with the values it is supposed to produce. These values include the input parameters (with their values and types) and the expected output (with the values and types of relevant variables) at the function's return. Note that if an input parameter's value is not mentioned in the expected output, it is presumed unchanged. Your role is not to fix the bug but to summarize the discrepancies between the function's current output and the expected output, referencing specific values that highlight these discrepancies.


# Example source code of the buggy function
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 0: # should be x > 1
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```

# Example expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `-5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `-5`, type: `int`

## Case 2
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `0`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `0`, type: `int`

## Case 3
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `1`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `1`, type: `int`

## Case 4
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `6`, type: `int`

# Example summary:
In case 3, x is equal to 1, which is grater than 0, so the function returns 2, however, the expected output is 1, indicating that the function is not working properly at this case. In case 4, x is greater than 0, so the function should return x + 1.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

# Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter values and types
### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
command.script, value: `'git'`, type: `str`

command, value: `Command(script=git, stdout=, stderr=
usage: git stash list [<options>]
   or: git stash show [<stash>]
   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q`, type: `str`
