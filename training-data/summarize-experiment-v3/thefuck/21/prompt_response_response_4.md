The bug in the `match` function is due to the assumption that the command's script will always contain more than 1 word. When the script is just "git", the split operation results in a list with only one element, and accessing index 1 will raise an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split result has at least 2 elements before accessing index 1. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function will first check if the split result contains at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the `IndexError` was raised when the script was just "git".
