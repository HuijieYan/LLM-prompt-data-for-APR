The issue describes how the 'git_fix_stash' rule fails when the script is just 'git', and the detailed description includes a traceback that shows an IndexError error occurring in the 'git_fix_stash.py' file at line 8. The match function checks whether the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, given the error message 'IndexError: list index out of range', it appears that the split operation used on the command script does not yield enough elements to perform the comparison, leading to the bug.
