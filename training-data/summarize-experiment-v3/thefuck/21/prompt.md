Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```# A failing test function for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py

def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test 'test_not_match' encountered an 'IndexError' at line 8 of the 'git_fix_stash.py' file. The error occurred in the 'match' function which is decorated by 'git_support' at line 32 of 'git.py'. The failing assertion failed to match the command script and its stderr with the expected condition, which resulted in the 'IndexError: list index out of range'.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- command.script, value: 'git', type: str
- command.stderr, value: '\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q', type: str
- splited_script, value: ['git'], type: list

Rational: The comparison of command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' will always return False because command.script contains only 'git' and not 'stash'. This indicates that the condition for the match function is not being met, leading to incorrect behavior.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the provided cases, the match function is expected to return True if the command.script contains 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is found in the command.stderr. However, based on the provided expected values and types, the current implementation of the function returns True only when the command.script is equal to 'stash' and the 'usage:' string is present in the command.stderr. Therefore, the discrepancies in the current and expected outputs need to be addressed.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

The issue describes how the 'git_fix_stash' rule fails when the script is just 'git', and the detailed description includes a traceback that shows an IndexError error occurring in the 'git_fix_stash.py' file at line 8. The match function checks whether the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, given the error message 'IndexError: list index out of range', it appears that the split operation used on the command script does not yield enough elements to perform the comparison, leading to the bug.
