The bug in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` module is due to the current implementation only checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the standard error. However, it should check if the word 'stash' is in the command's script and if 'usage:' is in the standard error.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the implementation to check for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command's script.
2. Fix the logic to check if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` module:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
