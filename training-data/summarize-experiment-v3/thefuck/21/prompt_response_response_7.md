## Bug's Cause

The bug occurs because the function is splitting the `command.script` without first verifying that it contains at least two elements. This leads to a `list index out of range` error when trying to access the second element of the split list.


## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the function should first verify that the split command has at least two elements before checking if the second element is 'stash'.


## The corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first splits the command script into its individual words and then checks if it contains at least two elements before proceeding to check if the second element is 'stash'. This should resolve the `list index out of range` issue reported in the GitHub issue.
