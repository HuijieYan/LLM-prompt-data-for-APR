## The bug's cause

The bug arises because the current implementation of the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash` module assumes that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements after splitting. Thus, when the script is just 'git', it raises an `IndexError` due to trying to access an element at index 1, which is out of range.

## Approaches for fixing the bug

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `match` function to check the presence of 'stash' in the command and whether 'usage:' is present in the standard error. This way, we can avoid the IndexError by not directly accessing the second element of the split command script.

## The corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function checks if 'stash' is present in the command's script and if 'usage:' is present in the standard error, without directly splitting the command script. This should resolve the bug and ensure the function performs as expected.
