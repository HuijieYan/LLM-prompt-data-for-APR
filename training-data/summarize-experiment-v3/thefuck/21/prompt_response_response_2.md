Based on the feedback collected and the description of the problem, the issue with the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash` module is being caused by an attempt to access index `1` of the split `command.script`, resulting in a list index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Check the length of the split script list before accessing index `1`.
2. Update the logic to ensure that the second part of the split script is 'stash' and that 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this updated code, the function first checks the length of the `splited_script` to ensure that there are enough elements before attempting to access index `1`. Then it verifies that the second part of the split script is 'stash' and that 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, addressing the issue identified in the GitHub report.

This correction should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as expected.
