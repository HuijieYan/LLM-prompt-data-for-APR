Based on the provided error message and the relevant stack frames, it can be summarized that the bug is likely occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` module. The `IndexError` is occurring on line 8 of the file when the `command.script` is being split and the index `1` is being accessed. This indicates that there are not enough elements to split, resulting in a list index out of range error.
