The bug in the provided `match` function is that it tries to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if the split actually has at least two elements. This results in an `IndexError` when the split does not have enough elements.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) >= 2 and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `splitted_script`. Then, we check if the length of `splitted_script` is greater than or equal to 2 to ensure that we have at least two elements in the split. If this condition is met, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

With this correction, the `IndexError` due to accessing an out-of-range index should be resolved, and the `match` function should now work as expected based on the test cases and expected behavior.
