In the provided source code, the function 'match' is expected to check if the command string contains 'stash' and if the command's standard error includes 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the standard error. This oversight results in discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs for the given cases. Specifically, the current implementation solely checks for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command's script, leading to inaccurate match results.
