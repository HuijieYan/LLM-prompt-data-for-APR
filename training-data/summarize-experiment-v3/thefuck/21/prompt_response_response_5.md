## Bug's Cause

The bug is caused by the assumption that the `split` operation on `command.script` will always result in a list with at least two elements. However, when the input command is just 'git', the split operation only results in a list with one element, resulting in the IndexError when trying to access index 1 in the list.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the match function to handle cases where the split operation does not result in at least two elements.

## The corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version uses the `split` function to split the script into parts, and then checks if there are at least two parts before accessing the index 1. If there are, it checks if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This ensures that the function doesn't encounter an IndexError when accessing the second part of the split script.
