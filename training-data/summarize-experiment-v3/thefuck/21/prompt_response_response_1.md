The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will contain at least two words, which is not always the case. The function tries to access the second element of the split command script without verifying that it exists, leading to a `list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should also check if 'stash' is the second word in the split script, not just anywhere in the script.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix checks if the split script has at least two elements, and then proceeds to check if 'stash' is the second word in the split script and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
