## Bug Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the function `get_new_command`. These options are not being removed from `command.script_parts` as expected, leading to discrepancies in the derived output values.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the implementation must correctly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the value of `push_upstream` must be derived correctly from the command's stderr output.

## The corrected code

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
