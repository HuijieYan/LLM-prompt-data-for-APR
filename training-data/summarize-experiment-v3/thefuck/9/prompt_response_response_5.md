The potential error location within the buggy function is the handling of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the command script_parts.

The bug's cause is that the function get_new_command is not properly handling the "--set-upstream" flag or "-u" option, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual output.

Approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking for both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options separately and removing them from the command.script_parts as necessary.
2. Updating the method for deriving the push_upstream value to ensure it accurately captures the suggested git command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there's an argument to remove as well
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should handle the presence of "--set-upstream" and "-u" options properly, remove them from the command.script_parts, and accurately derive the push_upstream value. This will ensure the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
