The failing test is located in the test_git_push.py file and asserts the expected output of the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates an IndexError in the git_push.py file on line 27. This is caused by trying to pop elements in the `command.script_parts` list that is already empty. The root cause is the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from `command.script_parts` where both options are not present causing the pop operation to fail.
