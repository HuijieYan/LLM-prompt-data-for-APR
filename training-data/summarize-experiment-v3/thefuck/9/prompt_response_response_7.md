## Bug's Location
The potential error location within the function is when attempting to remove the '--set-upstream' and its argument from the command.script_parts list. If the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are not present in the list, the index will return -1, indicating the absence of these options. However, the implementation does not handle this case properly, leading to an IndexError when attempting to remove the options.


## Bug's Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options within the command.script_parts list. This causes discrepancies in the expected and actual output values, resulting in the failing test and the corresponding IndexError. The failing test also provides details about the incorrect behavior of the function related to the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts.


## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the presence or absence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list. This can be addressed by implementing conditional checks to remove these options only if they are present in the list. Additionally, the derivation of push_upstream should be adjusted to ensure that the correct value is obtained.


## The corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected code now includes conditional checks to properly handle the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list. It removes these options and their arguments only if they are present, addressing the issue that caused the failing test. Additionally, the derivation of push_upstream remains unchanged as it was already correctly obtaining the expected value. This correction meets the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
