The issue occurs because the function get_new_command does not handle the "--set-upstream" flag or "-u" option properly, leading to an IndexError in the failing test. The function is not correctly removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from command.script_parts and not correctly deriving the push_upstream value. This is evidenced by discrepancies in the expected and actual input/output values.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the "--set-upstream" flag and "-u" option by removing them from command.script_parts and correctly deriving the push_upstream value.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above corrections, the function will handle the "--set-upstream" flag and "-u" option properly, leading to the expected behavior and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
