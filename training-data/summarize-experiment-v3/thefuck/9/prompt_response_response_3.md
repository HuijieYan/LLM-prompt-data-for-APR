Based on the analysis, the issue in the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options. Additionally, it fails to derive the correct value for push_upstream. This can be seen in the failing test, which leads to an IndexError when the pop method is called on an empty list.

To fix the bug:
1. Handle the "--set-upstream" and "-u" options properly by removing them and their corresponding arguments from command.script_parts.
2. Derive the correct value for push_upstream based on the git stderr message.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function will handle the "--set-upstream" and "-u" options properly and derive the correct value for push_upstream, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
