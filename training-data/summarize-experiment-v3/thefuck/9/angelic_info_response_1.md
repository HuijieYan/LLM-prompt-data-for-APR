In the expected case 1, the expected value of upstream_option_index is -1, indicating that the --set-upstream or -u options should not be present in command.script_parts. However, the current implementation does not remove these options, leading to discrepancies with the expected output. Additionally, the expected value of push_upstream is 'push --set-upstream origin master', which is not being correctly derived in the current implementation. These discrepancies highlight the issues in the current implementation of the get_new_command function.
