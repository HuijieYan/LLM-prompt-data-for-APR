In expected case 1, the expected value of `push_upstream` is `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, which signifies that the function is not correctly extracting the required string from the `command.stderr` and that this discrepancy impacts the overall output. This suggests that the `get_new_command` function is not operating as expected, and the bug is likely related to the extraction of the `push_upstream` variable.
