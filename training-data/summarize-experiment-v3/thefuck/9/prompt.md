## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_9/thefuck/rules/git_push.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The error seems to be originating on line 27 in the file git_push.py, where the pop method is called on an empty list; this results in an IndexError. It seems that the function get_new_command is not handling the "--set-upstream" flag or "-u" option properly, as evidenced by the IndexError in the failing test.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- Case 1: 
   - command.script_parts (value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`)
   - push_upstream (value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`)
Rational: The script_parts value caused the function to behave incorrectly by appending '--set-upstream origin master' to the push command. This indicates that the buggy function fails to correctly handle the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command script_parts.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the expected case 1, the expected value of upstream_option_index is -1, indicating that the --set-upstream or -u options should not be present in command.script_parts. However, the current implementation does not remove these options, leading to discrepancies with the expected output. Additionally, the expected value of push_upstream is 'push --set-upstream origin master', which is not being correctly derived in the current implementation. These discrepancies highlight the issues in the current implementation of the get_new_command function.

#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```
