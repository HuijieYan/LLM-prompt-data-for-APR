def test_get_new_command(stderr):

        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\

    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test is located in the test_git_push.py file and asserts the expected output of the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates an IndexError in the git_push.py file on line 27. This is caused by trying to pop elements in the `command.script_parts` list that is already empty. The root cause is the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from `command.script_parts` where both options are not present causing the pop operation to fail.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: 
  - command.script_parts (value: `['git', 'push']`, type: list)
  - command.stderr (value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: str)
- Output: 
  - push_upstream (value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: str)
Rational: The bug seems to be occurring when the --set-upstream or -u options are present in the command. The push_upstream variable is including these options when it's not supposed to.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In expected case 1, the expected value of `push_upstream` is `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, which signifies that the function is not correctly extracting the required string from the `command.stderr` and that this discrepancy impacts the overall output. This suggests that the `get_new_command` function is not operating as expected, and the bug is likely related to the extraction of the `push_upstream` variable.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Based on the issue description, it seems that the bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the incorrect suggestion for the `git push -u` command. The function does not properly handle the upstream option and fails to generate the correct command for setting the upstream branch. This results in a faulty suggestion for the `git push -u` command, leading to the wrong output. The source of the bug can be traced to the handling of the upstream option index and the extraction of the push upstream value from the command's stderr.
