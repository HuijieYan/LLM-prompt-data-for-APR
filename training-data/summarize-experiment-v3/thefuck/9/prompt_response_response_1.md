The potential error location within the buggy function is the block of code that attempts to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command.script_parts list with the pop method. The issue arises when the pop method is called on an empty list, resulting in an IndexError.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the failing test, which experiences an IndexError when attempting to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command.script_parts list. The failing test indicates that the get_new_command function does not handle these options properly, leading to discrepancies with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we should handle the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the command.script_parts list and ensure that these options are correctly removed before further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list if present
    modified_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(modified_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we use a list comprehension to create a new list (`modified_script_parts`) containing all elements from `command.script_parts` that are not equal to '--set-upstream' or '-u'. This ensures that these options are properly removed, preventing the IndexError from occurring. We then proceed with further processing to obtain the correct `push_upstream` value and return the modified command.

With this correction, the program should pass the failing test and the function will handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options properly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
