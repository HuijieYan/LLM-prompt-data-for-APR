## Bug's Cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options in the command script_parts. The function does not appropriately remove these options, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the command script_parts. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct value for push_upstream is derived from the command.stderr. 

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the remove method to remove "--set-upstream" or "-u" from command.script_parts, and correctly deriving the value of push_upstream from command.stderr, the corrected function should now handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options properly and provide the expected output.
