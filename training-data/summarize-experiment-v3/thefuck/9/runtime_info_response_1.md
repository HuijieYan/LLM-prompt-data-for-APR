The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: 
  - command.script_parts (value: `['git', 'push']`, type: list)
  - command.stderr (value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: str)
- Output: 
  - push_upstream (value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: str)
Rational: The bug seems to be occurring when the --set-upstream or -u options are present in the command. The push_upstream variable is including these options when it's not supposed to.
