## The bug's cause

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the get_new_command function fails to handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options properly. This results in an IndexError when the pop method is called on an empty list. Additionally, the value of push_upstream is not being correctly derived, leading to discrepancies with the expected output.

## Suggested approaches for fixing the bug

1. Check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in command.script_parts and remove them if found.
2. Ensure that the push_upstream value is correctly extracted from the command.stderr.

## The corrected code

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code adds conditionals to check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list and removes them if found. Additionally, it ensures that the push_upstream value is correctly extracted from the command.stderr. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
