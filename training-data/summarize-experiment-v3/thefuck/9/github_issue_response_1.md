Based on the issue description, it seems that the bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the incorrect suggestion for the `git push -u` command. The function does not properly handle the upstream option and fails to generate the correct command for setting the upstream branch. This results in a faulty suggestion for the `git push -u` command, leading to the wrong output. The source of the bug can be traced to the handling of the upstream option index and the extraction of the push upstream value from the command's stderr.
