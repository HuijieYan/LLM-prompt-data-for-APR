The bug in the get_new_command function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options. This leads to an IndexError when trying to remove these options from the command.script_parts list. Additionally, the push_upstream value is not being correctly derived in the current implementation, leading to discrepancies with the expected output.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the get_new_command function to correctly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options from the script_parts list and ensure the correct derivation of the push_upstream value.

Here is the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) >= upstream_option_index + 2:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and derive the push_upstream value, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the GitHub issue.
