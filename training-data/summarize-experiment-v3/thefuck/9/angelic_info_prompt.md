Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing runtime information of a program to identify a bug. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with the values it is supposed to produce. These values include the input parameters (with their values and types) and the expected output (with the values and types of relevant variables) at the function's return. Note that if an input parameter's value is not mentioned in the expected output, it is presumed unchanged. Your role is not to fix the bug but to summarize the discrepancies between the function's current output and the expected output, referencing specific values that highlight these discrepancies.


# Example source code of the buggy function
```python
def f(x):
    if x > 0: # should be x > 1
        y = x + 1
    else:
        y = x
    return y
```

# Example expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `-5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `-5`, type: `int`

## Case 2
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `0`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `0`, type: `int`

## Case 3
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `1`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `1`, type: `int`

## Case 4
### Input parameter value and type
x, value: `5`, type: `int`
### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
y, value: `6`, type: `int`

# Example summary:
In case 3, x is equal to 1, which is grater than 0, so the function returns 2, however, the expected output is 1, indicating that the function is not working properly at this case. In case 4, x is greater than 0, so the function should return x + 1.


## The source code of the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

# Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter values and types
### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, expected value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`
