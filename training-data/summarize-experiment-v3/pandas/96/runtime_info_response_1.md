The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: other (value: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`, type: `Timestamp`), self.n (value: 1, type: int)
- Output: other (value: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`, type: `datetime`)
Rational: The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime values based on the input parameters, leading to an unexpected output. The bug may be related to the adjustment of business hours and days. The function does not seem to be handling the adjustment logic correctly.
