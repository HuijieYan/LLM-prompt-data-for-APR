## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, _get_calendar, _is_normalized, _to_dt64, apply_index_wraps, as_datetime, roll_yearday, shift_month
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_96/pandas/tseries/offsets.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,

## Summary of Related Functions

Class `BusinessHourMixin` is the primary class containing the `apply` function mentioned. This function interacts with a large number of other functions within the same file. It also calls functions such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset` within the same class. Additionally, there are external functions `apply_wraps` and `is_on_offset` that are likely to be used in the `apply` function. The `apply` function primarily seems to be dealing with datetime and business hour calculations, and it is integrating a lot of different logic to achieve this. The issue with this function might likely be related to the logic involved in datetime calculations, as well as how it interacts with the other functions and classes in the file.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to test the functionality of `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency that starts at 15:00 and includes a holiday on "2020-11-26". However, the error message indicates that there is an issue when validating the frequency, as the inferred frequency does not conform to the expected frequency. The failure occurred within the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimes` module when attempting to create the expected `pd.DatetimeIndex`, which is related to a validation error regarding the compatibility of a frequency with the values of a DatetimeArray/Index. The error is encapsulated within a `ValueError` and is raised due to the discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

In summary, the failing test is encountering a bug related to the validation of the frequency or inferred frequency, which is causing the test to fail.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: other (value: `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`, type: `Timestamp`), self.n (value: 1, type: int)
- Output: other (value: `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`, type: `datetime`)
Rational: The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime values based on the input parameters, leading to an unexpected output. The bug may be related to the adjustment of business hours and days. The function does not seem to be handling the adjustment logic correctly.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
This code works fine

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
Output:

DatetimeIndex(['2020-11-25 10:00:00', '2020-11-25 11:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 12:00:00', '2020-11-25 13:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 14:00:00', '2020-11-25 15:00:00',

               '2020-11-27 11:00:00', '2020-11-27 12:00:00',
               '2020-11-27 13:00:00', '2020-11-27 14:00:00',

               '2020-12-01 15:00:00', '2020-12-01 16:00:00',

               '2020-12-02 12:00:00'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='CBH')
If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',end='2020-11-27 16:00:00',
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
