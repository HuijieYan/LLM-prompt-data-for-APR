Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue with the `apply` function is causing problems with the `pd.date_range` functionality when using custom business hours and holidays. This issue is related to the validation of frequency and inferred frequency, leading to unexpected results in the date range generation.

The bug's potential location lies in the logic of adjusting business days and hours within the `apply` function, which might not be handling datetime values correctly.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to review and revise the business day and business hour adjustment logic within the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly handles the datetime values with respect to the given holidays and business hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function with the potential fixes implemented:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing logic)

        # adjust by business days first
        if abs(bd) > 0:
            direction = 1 if n > 0 else -1  # direction of adjustment
            while bd != 0:  # adjust by business days
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + BusinessDay(direction)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + BusinessDay(direction).apply(other))
                bd -= direction

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if r != 0:
            direction = 1 if n > 0 else -1  # direction of adjustment
            remainder = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while remainder != timedelta(0):  # adjust by remaining business hours
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    business_hours = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    business_hours = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if remainder >= business_hours:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours) if n > 0 else self._get_closing_time(other + business_hours)
                    remainder -= business_hours
                else:
                    other += remainder
                    remainder = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code revises the adjustment of business days and hours to ensure that it correctly handles the datetime values with respect to the given holidays and business hours, addressing the issue encountered with `pd.date_range`.
