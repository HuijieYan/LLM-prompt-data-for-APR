The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to test the functionality of `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency that starts at 15:00 and includes a holiday on "2020-11-26". However, the error message indicates that there is an issue when validating the frequency, as the inferred frequency does not conform to the expected frequency. The failure occurred within the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimes` module when attempting to create the expected `pd.DatetimeIndex`, which is related to a validation error regarding the compatibility of a frequency with the values of a DatetimeArray/Index. The error is encapsulated within a `ValueError` and is raised due to the discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

In summary, the failing test is encountering a bug related to the validation of the frequency or inferred frequency, which is causing the test to fail.
