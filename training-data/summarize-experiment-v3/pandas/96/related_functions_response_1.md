Class `BusinessHourMixin` is the primary class containing the `apply` function mentioned. This function interacts with a large number of other functions within the same file. It also calls functions such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset` within the same class. Additionally, there are external functions `apply_wraps` and `is_on_offset` that are likely to be used in the `apply` function. The `apply` function primarily seems to be dealing with datetime and business hour calculations, and it is integrating a lot of different logic to achieve this. The issue with this function might likely be related to the logic involved in datetime calculations, as well as how it interacts with the other functions and classes in the file.
