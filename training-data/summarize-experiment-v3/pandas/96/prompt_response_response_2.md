## Bug's Cause
The issue might be caused due to the incorrect adjustment of the business hours and days inside the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The incorrect adjustment logic leads to unexpected outputs, causing discrepancies in the frequency validation for generating `pd.DatetimeIndex` when using the `pd.date_range` function.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function accurately reflect the intended behavior of adjusting business hours and days.

## Corrected Code
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        new_other = other.replace(tzinfo=None).replace(microsecond=0)

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    new_other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    new_other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * businesshours), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                new_other = new_other + skip_bd

            days_to_adjust = r // businesshours
            remaining_seconds = r % businesshours * 60

            if n >= 0:
                for _ in range(days_to_adjust):
                    new_other = self._next_opening_time(new_other)
            else:
                for _ in range(days_to_adjust):
                    new_other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            new_other = new_other + timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)

        return new_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic for handling business hours and days within the `apply` function to ensure that the adjustments are made accurately. The adjusted logic should resolve the issue experienced when using the `pd.date_range` function in certain scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
