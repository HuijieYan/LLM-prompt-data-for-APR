## Bug Cause
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of dates and times when dealing with business hours and days. This issue manifests when using the `pd.CustomBusinessHour` frequency in conjunction with holidays, as observed in the failing test case. The `apply` function should appropriately handle the adjustment logic for business hours and days but appears to be creating a mismatch between the expected and actual outcomes.

# Approach for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the faulty logic responsible for the incorrect date and time adjustments within the `apply` function should be identified and corrected. Additionally, the business hour and day logic should be carefully evaluated to ensure that it properly accounts for holidays and business schedules.

# Corrected Code for the Buggy Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self._holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[-1]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if other in self._holidays:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, remainder = divmod(abs(n), businesshours / 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, remainder = -bd, -remainder

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
            while other in self._holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        minutes_left = int(remainder)

        if n >= 0:
            while minutes_left > 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_diff = (closing_time - other).seconds // 60
                if minutes_left < time_diff:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += timedelta(minutes=minutes_left)
                    minutes_left = 0
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    minutes_left -= time_diff
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                    if other in self._holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while minutes_left < 0:
                opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                time_diff = (other - opening_time).seconds // 60
                if abs(minutes_left) < time_diff or (abs(minutes_left) == time_diff and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(minutes_left))
                    minutes_left = 0
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    minutes_left += time_diff
                    closing_prev_opening = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(closing_prev_opening)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code incorporates several changes to address the identified issues:
1. Proper handling of holiday dates when adjusting for business days and hours.
2. Correct adjustment logic for both positive and negative business hour offsets.
3. Improved validation of business hour intervals to ensure accurate adjustments.
4. Removal of unnecessary attribute manipulation to ensure consistent date and time adjustments.

The corrections made to the `apply` function should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test and align the actual output with the expected output.
