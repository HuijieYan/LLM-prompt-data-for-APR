## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import lib, properties, reshape, tslibs
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import ensure_platform_int, is_bool, is_categorical_dtype, is_dict_like, is_extension_array_dtype, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_object_dtype, is_scalar
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCMultiIndex, ABCPeriodIndex, ABCSeries
from pandas.core.arrays import ExtensionArray
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Float64Index, Index, InvalidIndexError, MultiIndex, ensure_index
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_21/pandas/core/series.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```


## Summary of Related Functions

`def _slice(self, slobj: slice, axis: int=0) -> 'Series'`:  This function is likely used to slice a `Series` object based on the given slice object and axis.

`def _get_values_tuple(self, key)`: This function probably retrieves values based on the provided key, although the specifics of this function are not relevant to the issue at hand.

`def reindex(self, index=None, **kwargs)`: This function likely reindexes the `Series` based on the specified index or keyword arguments.

The `def _get_with(self, key)`: This function is the one that needs attention as it seems to handle various types of keys and performs different operations based on the type. Debugging this function might reveal the underlying cause of the issue.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test titled `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `test_getitem.py` raises a `KeyError` exception because the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" does not match with the expected exception. Specifically, the failure occurs at the `ser[key]` line. The failing parameterized test cases were using the given `box` function object to create different types of objects to be tested. All instances of these tests failed, citing the error message above, and pointing to the exact line.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- key, value: `['C']`, type: `list`
- key_type, value: `'string'`, type: `str`

Rational: The key_type is incorrectly identified as 'string' instead of 'object', possibly leading to incorrect behavior in the function.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In all test cases provided, the 'key_type' variable is expected to have the value of 'string' with type 'str' before the function's return. However, the current implementation of the function does not produce the expected output in any of the cases. This indicates that the function is not correctly inferring the type of the 'key' input parameter. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual output, and the function is not working as intended, likely due to a bug.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
We treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers:

ser = pd.Series(["A", "B"])
key = pd.Series(["C"])

>>> ser[key]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[pd.Index(key)]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[np.array(key)]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[list(key)]
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File "/Users/bmendel/Desktop/pd/pandas/pandas/core/indexing.py", line 1312, in _validate_read_indexer
    raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [{axis_name}]")
KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"
Also inconsistent because ser.loc[key] raises for all 4 cases.

Is there a compelling reason for this? I tried making all of these behave like the list case and only one test broke (that test being the example above). The test was added in #5880.
```
