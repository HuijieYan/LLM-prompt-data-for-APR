The failing test titled `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `test_getitem.py` raises a `KeyError` exception because the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" does not match with the expected exception. Specifically, the failure occurs at the `ser[key]` line. The failing parameterized test cases were using the given `box` function object to create different types of objects to be tested. All instances of these tests failed, citing the error message above, and pointing to the exact line.
