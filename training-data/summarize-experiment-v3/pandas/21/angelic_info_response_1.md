In all test cases provided, the 'key_type' variable is expected to have the value of 'string' with type 'str' before the function's return. However, the current implementation of the function does not produce the expected output in any of the cases. This indicates that the function is not correctly inferring the type of the 'key' input parameter. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual output, and the function is not working as intended, likely due to a bug.
