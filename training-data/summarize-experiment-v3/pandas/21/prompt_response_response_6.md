The potential error in the `def _get_with(self, key)` function lies in the incorrect identification of the key_type when it is a list. It seems the function is not correctly inferring the type of the 'key' input parameter, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly identified as 'string' for lists, and the function should behave consistently regardless of the type of indexer.

Here's the corrected code for the `def _get_with(self, key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = 'string'
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, when the key is identified as a list, it immediately sets the key_type to 'string' and returns `self.loc[key]`. This modification ensures consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer and correctly identifies the key_type for lists. Therefore, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
