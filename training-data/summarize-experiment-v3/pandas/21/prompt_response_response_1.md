According to the GitHub issue, the problem arises when using a list as an indexer in the `ser` object, where the behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers. All types except for the list indexer return `NaN`, and using `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases. The original implementation of the `_get_with` function likely makes an incorrect inference about the type of the key when it is a list, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should correctly identify the type of the key being used, and handle the list indexer case consistently with the other types of indexers.

Based on this assessment, here is the corrected implementation of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the case where the key is a list, and the behavior should be consistent with other types of indexers as described in the GitHub issue. This should address the inconsistency and the incorrect inference about the key's type, resolving the bug.
