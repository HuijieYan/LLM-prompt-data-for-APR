## Bug Cause

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect identification of the type of the 'key' input parameter, leading to unexpected behavior in the function. This incorrect identification causes the function to not behave as intended and results in the discrepancy between the expected and actual output. This is evident in the failing test cases, as well as the specific error message raised during the test.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly infer the type of the 'key' input parameter and perform the appropriate operations based on that type. Identifying and updating the logic responsible for determining the type of the 'key', and subsequently handling different types of keys, would likely resolve the issue.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using the `ensure_index` function, we ensure that the 'key' input parameter is properly identified and the correct operations are performed based on its type. This should address the issue and produce the expected output.
