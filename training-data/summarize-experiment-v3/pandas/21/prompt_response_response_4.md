## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class where it incorrectly handles the case when the `key` is a list. This results in inconsistent behavior and a `KeyError` message when accessing the `Series` object using a list key. The bug seems to be related to how the function infers the type of the key and how it handles different types of indexers.

## Bug Fix

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` method. Specifically, we need to ensure that when the `key` is a list, it is treated appropriately to avoid triggering a `KeyError`. We also need to improve the type inference for the `key` variable to ensure that it is identified correctly. 

Additionally, the function should be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers to avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above corrected code, the `_get_with` method should now handle list indexers consistently and avoid triggering a `KeyError` for list indexers. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
