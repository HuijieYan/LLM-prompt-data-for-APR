Potential Error Location: The conditional branches for is_datetime64_dtype and is_timedelta64_dtype are suspect in the buggy function astype_nansafe. The execution flows within these branches are not handling NaN values correctly, which could lead to the failure to raise a ValueError as expected.

Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle NaN values properly within the conditional branches for datetime and timedelta dtype checks. As a result, when attempting to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer, the function does not raise the expected ValueError.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional branches for is_datetime64_dtype and is_timedelta64_dtype to properly handle NaN values and raise a ValueError when necessary.
2. Ensure that the conditional checks for datetimelike and timedelta types are working correctly and are able to differentiate between valid and invalid conversions.

Updated Code for the Buggy Function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    #... existing code ...

    # allow frequency conversions
    if dtype.kind in ["M", "m"]:
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NA values to datetime / timedelta")
            
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... existing code ...
```

With these modifications, the code should now properly handle the conversion of datetime and timedelta dtypes, including NaN values, and raise appropriate ValueErrors when needed. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure proper handling of dtype conversions in the astype_nansafe function.
