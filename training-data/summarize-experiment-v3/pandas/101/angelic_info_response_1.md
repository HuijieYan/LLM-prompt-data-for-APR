The function astype_nansafe is expected to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, in the failed test cases, the expected outputs indicate that the casted dtype, specifically for case 1 and case 2, should be 'int64' with a kind of 'i' and name of 'int64'. This suggests that the current function is not properly casting the elements of the array to the expected dtype, leading to a discrepancy between the current and expected outputs.
