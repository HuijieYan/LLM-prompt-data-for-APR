It seems that the failing tests are related to the buggy function `astype_nansafe`. The error message states that it did not raise the expected `ValueError` when attempting to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer. The issue appears to be in the conditional branch where it checks for `np.datetime64` and `np.timedelta64` datatypes. It seems that these checks are not working correctly and causing the function to not raise a `ValueError` as expected when the input is NaT.
