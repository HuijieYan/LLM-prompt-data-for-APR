The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` is related to the incorrect handling of NaN values during dtype conversion. The function does not raise a ValueError as expected when attempting to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer. This issue has been raised on GitHub, and the description mentions that converting categorical series back into an integer column leads to unexpected negative integer values for NaN categories.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function raises the expected ValueError when attempting to convert NaN values to an inappropriate dtype, such as int.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Or when attempting to convert NaN to an inappropriate dtype.

    """
    # ... (rest of the function)

    if is_object_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype.type, np.integer):
        if not isna(arr).any():
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to an integer dtype")

    # ... (rest of the function)

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        msg = (
            f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
            f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected code:
- We added a new conditional block to handle the case where the input array has object dtype and the target dtype is a subtype of integer. If NaN values are present in the array, it raises a ValueError indicating that NaN values cannot be converted to an integer dtype.
- This addresses the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub report about unexpected negative integer values for NaN categories when converting categorical series to an integer column.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle NaN values during dtype conversion and raise the expected ValueError when attempting to convert NaN to an inappropriate dtype.
