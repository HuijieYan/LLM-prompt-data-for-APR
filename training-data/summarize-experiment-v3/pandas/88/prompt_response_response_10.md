## Bug Analysis

The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to how it handles multiindex columns, as indicated by the failing test cases. The error message "AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'" suggests that the function is trying to access a 'columns' attribute on a 'Series' object, which is likely a result of an unexpected data type or structure within the function's processing. This inconsistency seems to happen when the function deals with multiindex column combinations, leading to the attribute error.

Additionally, the function seems to be interacting with related functions `_add_margins` and `log_action`, which may further contribute to the unexpected behavior.

## Bug Location

The bug is likely located within the block of code where the function checks for a specific condition related to multiindex columns and subsequently tries to access the 'columns' attribute. The block involving the following condition seems to be the source of the bug:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

This block is likely encountering the 'Series' object, leading to the attribute error.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug seems to stem from how the function handles multiindex columns, which might be leading to the unexpected data type of the 'table' variable when trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

## Bug Fixes

To fix the bug, the function may need to be modified to handle multiindex columns more robustly and ensure that the data types and structures are appropriately accounted for throughout the computation. Specifically, the condition involving accessing the 'columns' attribute on the 'table' variable should be reviewed and adjusted to avoid the attribute error.

The correction should also ensure that the function interacts appropriately with related functions such as `_add_margins` and `log_action` to maintain consistent behavior.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# Import necessary packages and types
from typing import Union
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, concat, Series

# Corrected pivot_table function
def pivot_table(
    data: DataFrame,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> DataFrame:
    # Existing code...

    if isinstance(table, DataFrame) and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    # Existing code...

    return table
```

In the corrected code, the condition for accessing the 'columns' attribute on the 'table' variable has been adjusted to ensure that it operates on a DataFrame and that 'table' is not empty before attempting to access 'columns'. This modification should prevent the attribute error related to multiindex columns and 'Series' objects.

By making these changes, the corrected `pivot_table` function should resolve the attribute error related to multiindex columns and provide consistent behavior across different index and column combinations.
