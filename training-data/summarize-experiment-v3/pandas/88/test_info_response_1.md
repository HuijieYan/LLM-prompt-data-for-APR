Based on the failing test cases, the stack trace shows that there are errors related to the `df2.pivot_table` function call in the `pivot_table` function of the `pandas.core.frame` and `pandas.core.reshape.pivot` modules. The error message indicates that the `'Series'` object has no attribute `'columns'`, which is likely a point of failure when the `pivot_table` function is invoked with different multiindex column combinations (`cols`). The failing tests provide different `cols` values, including the combination (1, 2), ('a', 'b'), (1, 'b'), and ('a', 1), and each of these cases results in the same attribute error. Therefore, the bug appears to be related to the handling of multiindex columns in the `pivot_table` function, which may not be accounting for the multiindex setup appropriately, leading to the attribute error.
