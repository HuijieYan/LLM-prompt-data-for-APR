The stack trace and error message indicate that the issue is occurring within the `_get_grouper` function at the statement `raise KeyError(gpr)` where it raises a `KeyError`. This error is raised when attempting to process the grouping of the dataframe involving the argument passed for the `group_name`. The error occurs when the `group_name` is specified as a single string or a list with a single string, leading to a condition where the input key is not found in the data object. This suggests that there might be an issue in processing and matching the input key with the data object.
