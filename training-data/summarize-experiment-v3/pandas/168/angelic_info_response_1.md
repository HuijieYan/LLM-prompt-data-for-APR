The function `_get_grouper` is meant to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, but it seems to encounter issues with the input parameters. In both cases, the expected output for the variables `group_axis`, `is_tuple`, `all_hashable`, `keys`, `match_axis_length`, `any_arraylike`, and others is not met. The discrepancies indicate that the function is not processing the input parameters as intended, leading to incorrect variable values and types. This suggests that the function may not be correctly determining the groupings and exclusions, and may not be creating the internals grouper as expected. Further investigation and debugging of the function's logic are needed to identify the specific bug causing these discrepancies.
