Class docstrings: The class related to `_get_grouper` is not present in the example provided. Therefore, I will not make assumptions based on class docstrings.

`_is_label_like(val)`: This function is used in the `_get_grouper` function, but its details are not provided. This function likely takes a parameter `val` and returns a boolean value, possibly indicating whether the input is a label.

`_get_grouper(self, obj, validate=True)`: This function is almost identical in signature to the `_get_grouper` function we are analyzing. It seems to be a helper function with similar functionality to the main `_get_grouper` method. 

`is_in_axis(key)`: It appears to be a helper function, likely taking a `key` parameter and performing some checks related to the axis.

`is_in_obj(gpr)`: It seems to be another helper function, probably related to checking the existence of an object.

The `_get_grouper` function is a rather large and complex function that seems to be involved in creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This function appears to manipulate and process data based on the parameters provided and is reliant on the helper functions mentioned above. The issue with the `_get_grouper` function could be related to any of the operations or parameter checks performed within this large block of code.
