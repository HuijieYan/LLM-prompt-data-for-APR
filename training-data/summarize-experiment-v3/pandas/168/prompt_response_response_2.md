## Bug Cause Analysis

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be caused by the handling of the input parameter `key`, specifically when `key` is a string or a list with a single string. This leads to a condition where the input key is not found in the data object, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised. This issue is evident in the failing test case scenarios and the corresponding error message.

The issue seems to stem from how the function processes the input parameter `key` and attempts to match it with the data object. The function has conditional logic and checks related to the type and content of the `key` parameter, which may be leading to unexpected behavior and the raised `KeyError`.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix this bug, the conditional logic and checks related to the `key` parameter need to be revisited and potentially modified to ensure that the function correctly processes the `key` input. This may involve refining the checks to handle string keys and lists with a single string element appropriately. Additionally, it may be necessary to update the conditional logic related to the `key` parameter to align with the expected behavior of grouping by columns.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplify the logic for non-MultiIndex instances
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Simplify the logic for handling level as a list-like object
    if is_list_like(level):
        nlevels = len(level)
        if nlevels == 1:
            level = level[0]
        elif nlevels == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    if level and obj.index.name != level:
        raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        # Handle grouping by column name when axis is 1
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = obj[key]  # Transform key into the column

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]  # Unpack the list if it has a single element

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... (remaining logic for processing keys)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The corrected code includes simplified and refined conditional logic to address the issues identified in the bug cause analysis. Specifically, the code now properly handles the case where the `key` parameter is a string or a list with a single string element, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior of grouping by columns when `axis` is set to 1. Additionally, the code has been updated to handle the `level` parameter more effectively and to unpack a list with a single element if necessary.

With these corrections, the `_get_grouper` function should now process the input parameters as intended and avoid raising a `KeyError` when grouping by columns. This corrected code should resolve the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
