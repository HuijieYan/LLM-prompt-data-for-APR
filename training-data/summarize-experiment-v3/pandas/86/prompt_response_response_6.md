The potential error location within the "pivot" function is the block of code that handles the case when the "values" argument is not None. Specifically, the line "index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])" is causing the KeyError due to the missing "index" argument, as indicated by the error message and the failing test.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The buggy function "pivot" tries to handle the case when the "values" argument is not None, but it fails to properly handle the case when "index" is None and "columns" is passed as an argument.
(b) The failing test "test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error" calls the "pivot" function with missing required arguments, resulting in a KeyError due to the missing "index" argument.
(c) The corresponding error message indicates a KeyError occurrence due to a missing "index" argument.
(d) The GitHub issue points out that the error message is confusing and should indicate that "columns" is not optional, which aligns with the failing test scenario.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the "index" argument is None and handle it appropriately when "values" is not None.
2. Ensure that the error message accurately reflects the requirement for the "columns" argument in the pivot function.

Here is the corrected code for the "pivot" function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if columns is None:
            raise ValueError("The 'columns' argument is required in the pivot function.")

        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]

        if columns is None:
            raise ValueError("The 'columns' argument is required in the pivot function.")

        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, we added checks for the "columns" argument to ensure it is not None, and appropriately raised a ValueError if it is missing. This resolves the issue raised in the failing test and aligns with the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.
