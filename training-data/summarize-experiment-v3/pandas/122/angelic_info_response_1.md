Based on the detailed case provided, the expected output of the function does not match the current output. Specifically, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is problematic, as the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function seems to be producing an unexpected order. Additionally, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not yielding the expected results, which indicates that the logic for comparing these two sets of blocks is flawed. Moreover, the comparison between the `self_axes` and `other_axes` also does not provide the expected output, which points to a potential issue in the comparison logic. These discrepancies suggest that the function is not working as intended and requires further investigation to identify and address the underlying bug.
