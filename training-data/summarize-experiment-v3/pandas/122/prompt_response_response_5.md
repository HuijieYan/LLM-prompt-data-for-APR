Based on the analysis, the bug is likely caused by the comparison of the blocks within the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` tuples, leading to false negatives in the equality check. The issue has also been reported on GitHub, with an example demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should review the comparison and sorting logic within the `equals` function, specifically focusing on how the blocks are compared and sorted. Additionally, we should consider the reported GitHub issue and the expected output to ensure that the function behaves as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Sort the blocks by their type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare the sorted blocks for equality
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type name and manager locations using the `canonicalize` function, we ensure a consistent order for comparison. Additionally, we compare the sorted blocks for equality, addressing the reported issue and ensuring that the function meets the expected output.

This corrected code should resolve the bug and meet the expected behavior, as well as address the GitHub issue.
