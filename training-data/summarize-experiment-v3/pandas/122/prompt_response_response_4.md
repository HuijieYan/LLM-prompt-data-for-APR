## Bug Cause

The bug in the `equals` function might be caused by the unexpected order of blocks during comparison, which leads to a false positive result. This is likely due to the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function, which may not accurately represent the order of the blocks. Additionally, the comparison of the axes within the BlockManager instances may be flawed, leading to an incorrect equality evaluation.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function needs to accurately represent the order of the blocks within the BlockManager instances. Additionally, the comparison of axes should be revised to ensure a correct equality evaluation.

## The Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to accurately represent the order of the blocks within the BlockManager instances by using only the manager locations for sorting. Additionally, the comparison of axes has been revised to ensure a correct equality evaluation. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
