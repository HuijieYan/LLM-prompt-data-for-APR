## Bug's Cause Analysis

The bug is likely caused by the comparison logic within the `equals` function. The issue is related to the comparison of blocks within the tuples `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Both tuples contain blocks of the same type and shape, but in a different order, which could lead to a false negative in the equality check. The comparison logic for the axes (`self_axes` and `other_axes`) also seems to be flawed, as it does not provide the expected output.

This bug results in the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" where the comparison between two dataframes (`df1` and `df2`) is expected to return False, but it is returning True, leading to an assertion error.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to account for the different order of blocks within the tuples.
2. Review the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function to ensure it produces the expected order for comparison.
3. Verify the comparison logic for axes to accurately determine whether the axes are truly equal.

## Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):  # check the length of axes
        return False
    
    # compare the values of axes
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):  # check the number of blocks
        return False

    # sort and compare the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)  # consider mgr_locs in sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)  # compare the sorted blocks
    )
```

By modifying the comparison logic and sorting the blocks based on `mgr_locs` and `dtype`, the corrected code aims to address the bug and pass the failing test case.
