## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_122/pandas/core/internals/managers.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: The BlockManager class is a core internal data structure to implement DataFrame, Series, etc. It manages a bunch of labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays. The related functions `as_array`, `equals`, `canonicalize`, and `_consolidate_inplace` are likely used to manipulate and compare the data within this class.

`def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None)`: This function likely converts the data within the BlockManager into an array, possibly with the option to transpose the array and specify specific items.

`def _consolidate_inplace(self)`: This function may be responsible for consolidating the data within the BlockManager in place.

`def equals(self, other)`: This function compares the BlockManager with another object, likely checking for equality between the two.

`def canonicalize(block)`: This function may be used to canonicalize the order of blocks within the BlockManager by combining the type name and manager locations.

The buggy function `equals(self, other)`: This function likely compares the axes and blocks of the current BlockManager instance with another instance. It then goes on to consolidate the data in place, canonicalize the block orders, and compare the blocks for equality. The issue with this function could be related to how it handles the comparison and consolidation of the data within the BlockManager.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Based on the error message, the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" is located in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py". The assertion error is saying that "True is not False", where the test case expects the result of the comparison between the two dataframes df1 and df2 to be False. The failing line in the test is where df1.equals(df2) is being asserted to be False, but the actual comparison is returning True. This directly points to the possible cause of the bug in the "equals" function in the pandas source code, particularly in the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- self.blocks, value: (IntBlock: slice(0, 1, 1), 1 x 2, dtype: int64, ObjectBlock: slice(1, 2, 1), 1 x 2, dtype: object), type: tuple
- other.blocks, value: (IntBlock: slice(1, 2, 1), 1 x 2, dtype: int64, ObjectBlock: slice(0, 1, 1), 1 x 2, dtype: object), type: tuple
Rational: The bug is likely related to the comparison of blocks within the tuples. Both tuples contain blocks of the same type and shape, but in a different order, which could lead to a false negative in the equality check.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the detailed case provided, the expected output of the function does not match the current output. Specifically, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is problematic, as the sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function seems to be producing an unexpected order. Additionally, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is not yielding the expected results, which indicates that the logic for comparing these two sets of blocks is flawed. Moreover, the comparison between the `self_axes` and `other_axes` also does not provide the expected output, which points to a potential issue in the comparison logic. These discrepancies suggest that the function is not working as intended and requires further investigation to identify and address the underlying bug.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
  version: 3.6.8
# Your code here
  df3 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': ['s', 'd']})
  df4 = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['s', 'd'], 'b': [1, 2]})
  df3.equals(df4)

Problem description

When I read the source code, I did a simple test on it, and then failed.

Expected Output
I expected it return False
