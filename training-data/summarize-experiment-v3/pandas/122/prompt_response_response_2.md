## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` tuples. The sorting logic based on the `canonicalize` function may be producing an unexpected order, leading to false negatives in the equality check. Additionally, the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` does not provide the expected output, suggesting a potential issue in the comparison logic.


## Approach to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` tuples produces the expected result. Additionally, the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` needs to be addressed to ensure the comparison logic works as intended.


## Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate data in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
The corrected code addresses the issues identified by ensuring that the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` tuples produces the expected result. Additionally, it ensures that the comparison between `self_axes` and `other_axes` works as intended.

This corrected code should resolve the bug and address the failing test case reported in the GitHub issue.
