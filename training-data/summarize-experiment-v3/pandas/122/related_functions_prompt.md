Help developers grasp why a function is failing by outlining its interactions with other functions or classes. Focus on the signatures and roles of related functions or classes to reveal how the problematic function fits within the larger codebase. Summarize related functions by refering to the example below. You should not solve the error directly.

## Example Buggy Function with Related Functions
```python
def log_action(action: str) -> None:
    # Details of this function are not the focal point

class DocumentProcessor:
    def append_text(self, text: str) -> None:
        # The implementation details of this method are not our concern

    def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None:
        # Ignore the workings of this method

    def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None:
        # The inner workings of this method are not relevant

    # The function with an issue needing attention
    def process_document(self, text_to_append: str, remove_chars: int, new_title: str) -> None:
        self.remove_text(remove_chars)
        self.append_text(text_to_append)
        self.update_title(new_title)
        log_action(f"Processed document " + self.title)
```

## Example Summary
The buggy function `process_document` first calls the function `def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None`. This function likely takes a length parameter, which is presumably the number of characters to be removed from the start or end of the document.

Then, the buggy function calls the `def append_text(self, text: str) -> None` function. From the name of the function, we can infer that this function appends text to an existing document, which is maintained by the current class, `DocumentProcessor`.

After that, the buggy function calls `def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None` function. This function likely changes the internal record of the class to store a new title name.

In the end, the function calls `log_action()`, which essentially prints a sequence of actions.

        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
    
```
