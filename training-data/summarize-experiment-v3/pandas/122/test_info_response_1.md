Based on the error message, the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" is located in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py". The assertion error is saying that "True is not False", where the test case expects the result of the comparison between the two dataframes df1 and df2 to be False. The failing line in the test is where df1.equals(df2) is being asserted to be False, but the actual comparison is returning True. This directly points to the possible cause of the bug in the "equals" function in the pandas source code, particularly in the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes.
