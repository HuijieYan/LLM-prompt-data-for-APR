The `equals` function is part of the `managers.py` file in the `pandas/core/internals` directory. This function compares two objects and determines if they are equal. It interacts with other functions and classes within the file, such as `self._consolidate_inplace()`, `block.equals()`, and `canonicalize`. The function performs comparisons, sorting, and canonicalization of blocks to check for equality. The related functions handle the internal processing and comparison of blocks, which is crucial to the overall equality check performed by the `equals` function.
