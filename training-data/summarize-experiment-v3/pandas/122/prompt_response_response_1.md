## Bug Cause

The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to the comparison and sorting of the blocks within the BlockManager. The comparison of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function may not be producing the expected order, leading to incorrect results in the equality check. Additionally, the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be functioning as intended, causing further discrepancies in the function's output.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To address the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Review the logic in the `equals` function to ensure that the comparison of blocks and axes is performed correctly.
2. Verify the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function to guarantee that it results in the expected block order.
3. Check the consolidation process in the `_consolidate_inplace` function to confirm that it is correctly consolidating the data within the BlockManager.
4. Validate the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` to determine the cause of the unexpected output.

## Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate the data in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    # Check the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort the blocks by type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code addresses the issues in the `equals` function by ensuring that the comparison of axes and blocks is performed correctly. It also validates the sorting logic and data consolidation process to produce the expected output. This corrected code aims to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue by providing accurate comparisons and handling of the BlockManager's data.
