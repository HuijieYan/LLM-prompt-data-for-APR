The issue seems to be related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method returning True even when the blocks have identical values but are located in different positions. This suggests an issue with the comparison logic, possibly within the `equals` method's comparison of the blocks.

The failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" expects the comparison between two dataframes to return False using the `equals()` method, but it is actually returning True, leading to an assertion error.

The potential issue within the buggy function may be related to the sorting logic using the `canonicalize` function to order the blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. Additionally, there could be a problem with the comparison logic when checking for equality between the blocks within the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the sorting and comparison logic within the `equals` method should be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks within the dataframes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function only uses the manager locations to create a sorting key for the blocks, as the dtype name may not be relevant for comparison. This change ensures that the comparison of blocks is based on their actual positions within the dataframes, addressing the issue raised in the failing test case and GitHub issue.
