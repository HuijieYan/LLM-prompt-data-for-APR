The issue appears to be a problem with the `index._get_level_number(i)` within the `_unstack_multiple` function. It's trying to get the level number that doesn't exist due to improper index handling.

To fix the bug, we need to update the indexing logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the cases where appropriate levels exist.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [c for c in range(index.nlevels) if c not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[c] for c in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[c] for c in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[c] for c in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[c] for c in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[c] for c in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[c] for c in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Calculate the dummy index based on the non-stacked levels
    dummy_index_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids]
    dummy_index_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]
    dummy_index_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"]

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=dummy_index_levels,
        codes=dummy_index_codes,
        names=dummy_index_names,
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    # Update the levels and names for the columns
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The changes made in the corrected version are as follows:
1. Removed the unnecessary `clocs = ...` line and used `rlocs` instead.
2. Renamed `dummy_index` construction based on the non-stacked levels.
3. Updated the unstacked DataFrame according to the new levels, names, and codes.

This correction should resolve the indexing logic issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function, ensuring that the unstacking process properly handles the provided data and levels.
