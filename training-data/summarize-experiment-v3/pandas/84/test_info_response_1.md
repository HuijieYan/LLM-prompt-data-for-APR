The failing tests `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` both fail on the `_get_level_number` function of the `_unstack_multiple` method, which is called from the `unstack` method. The error is raised due to an attempt to find the index of a level that does not exist. The original error messages indicate that the levels are not found in the names list, causing a `ValueError` or `KeyError` to be raised. This appears to be an issue with the indexing logic implemented in the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is trying to get the level number that doesn't exist due to improper index handling. Therefore, the bug is in the indexing logic of the `_unstack_multiple` function.
