The analysis of the failing test executions shows several discrepancies between the current output of the `_unstack_multiple` function and the expected output. For example, the expected values of the `clocs` variable before the function's return should be a list `[0, 1]`, but the current output shows a value of `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which is a tuple. Additionally, for the `dumm_index` variable, the expected value is a `MultiIndex` type, but the current output is a `DataFrame`. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working as expected and should be further investigated for potential bugs.
