Considering the provided context, the potential error location within the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be the logic responsible for obtaining the level numbers based on the provided `clocs`.

The bug's cause could be attributed to the fact that the indexing logic implemented in the `_unstack_multiple` function incorrectly handles the attempt to obtain the level number that doesn't exist, leading to ValueError or KeyError as reported in the test failures.

To fix this bug, the logic for obtaining the level numbers needs to be revised, ensuring that the provided `clocs` are properly evaluated with respect to the index levels. Additionally, a better index handling approach might need to be applied to account for the presence of hierarchical columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = []
    for clc in clocs:
        for i, n in enumerate(index.names):
            if isinstance(clc, tuple) and len(clc) == 2:
                if clc[0] == n[0] and clc[1] == n[1]:
                    clevel_numbers.append(i)
                    break
            elif clc == n:
                clevel_numbers.append(i)
                break

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    # The remaining code for reshaping the data and unstacking remains the same...
    # ... (omitted for brevity)
```

This updated code revises the logic for obtaining the level numbers (`clevel_numbers`) based on the provided `clocs` by traversing the index names and matching them with the provided values (considering both single and multi-level cases). This should resolve the issue with KeyError or ValueError being raised.

After applying this fix, the `unstack` tests should pass, and the `_unstack_multiple` function would successfully handle the unstacking process based on the input parameters. This corrected implementation should address the GitHub issue related to unstacking with tuple names as well.
