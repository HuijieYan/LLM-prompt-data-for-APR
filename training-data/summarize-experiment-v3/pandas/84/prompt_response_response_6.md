The issue description from GitHub provides information about the situation where `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` fails, resulting in a `ValueError` and a `KeyError`. It is evident from the error message that the problem arises from the `_get_level_number` method when it tries to find the index of a level that does not exist, causing a `ValueError` or `KeyError` to be raised.

The problematic code in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to how the index levels are handled, leading to an erroneous index access that triggers the error.

Based on the initial analysis, here are the identified potential errors:

1. The `clocs` parameter is expected to be a list of level numbers, but the current implementation erroneously deals with it as a tuple. This leads to issues during the reshaping operation.
2. The logic employed in reshaping the data to perform unstacking is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly, resulting in undesired outputs.

To fix these issues, the following approaches are suggested:

1. Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly process the `clocs` parameter, ensuring it is a list of level numbers.
2. Review the logic responsible for reshaping the data within the `_unstack_multiple` function to verify and update the handling of hierarchical columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Convert clocs to list

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
    # (Remaining logic for reshaping and unstacking)
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By converting the `clocs` parameter to a list and reviewing the reshaping logic, the corrected code aims to address the identified potential errors and align with the expected input/output variable information.
