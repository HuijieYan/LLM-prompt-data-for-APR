The function being analyzed, `_unstack_multiple`, appears to have a bug as it produces incorrect outputs for the runtime cases provided. The relevant input/output values are:

Case 1:
- Input parameters: clocs (value: ('A', 'a'), type: tuple), data (type: DataFrame)
- Output: unstacked (type: DataFrame)

Rational: The bug seems to be related to the unstacking of the data based on the input parameters. The output 'unstacked' does not match the expected unstacking based on the given input data.

Case 2:
- Input parameters: clocs (value: ('A', 'a'), type: tuple), data (type: DataFrame)
- Output: unstacked (type: DataFrame)

Rational: Similar to Case 1, the unstacking of the data based on the input parameters does not produce the expected output, indicating a potential bug in the function.

Case 3:
- Input parameters: clocs (value: (('A', 'a'), 'B'), type: tuple), data (type: DataFrame)
- Output: unstacked (type: DataFrame)

Rational: Once again, the unstacking process based on the input parameters does not result in the expected output, corroborating the presence of a bug in the function.
