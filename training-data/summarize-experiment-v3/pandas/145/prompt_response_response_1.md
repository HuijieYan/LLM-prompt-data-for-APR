The issue with the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be in the `column_op` function where it evaluates the operation on the columns. The expected output should be a DataFrame, but it appears that the output is an ndarray. This discrepancy could be causing the TypeError when the function is called in DataFrame arithmetic.

To resolve the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that the output is a DataFrame. Additionally, the use of the `expressions` module should be reviewed to ensure that it is handling the operations correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = column_op(left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- The `column_op` function now applies the operation directly to the columns using the `apply` method, ensuring that the output is a DataFrame.
- The use of the `expressions` module remains unchanged, as it appears to handle the operations correctly.

With these changes, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now be able to handle the DataFrame arithmetic operation without causing a TypeError.
