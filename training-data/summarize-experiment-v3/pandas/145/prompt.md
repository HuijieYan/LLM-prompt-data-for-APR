## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import Timedelta, Timestamp, lib, ops as libops
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCExtensionArray, ABCIndexClass, ABCSeries, ABCTimedeltaArray, ABCTimedeltaIndex
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_145/pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This `dispatch_to_series` function is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching the operation to the Series implementation column-by-column.

`column_op(a, b)`: This function appears to be used within the `dispatch_to_series` function to perform column-wise operations. It takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result of applying the `func` operation to each column.

`import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions`: The `dispatch_to_series` function imports the `expressions` module, suggesting that it may be used to evaluate the column-wise operations.

The function `dispatch_to_series` seems to have different logic paths based on the type of `right` parameter, as it handles scalar, DataFrame, and Series cases differently. The `column_op` function is used to perform the actual operation on the columns in different scenarios. There are also assertions to ensure that the shapes of the DataFrames and Series are compatible. The function concludes by evaluating the column operations and returning the new data.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The error occurs when calling the `dispatch_to_series` function from DataFrame arithmetic, specifically in the line `result = df * ser`. The error is a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for multiplication. The highest frames pointing to the error are in the pandas source code in the function `na_arithmetic_op`, and more precisely, in `expressions.py` and `array_ops.py`. The error seems to stem from handling `NaT` (Not a Time) values alongside numpy array operations.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: right (value: 0   NaT
1   NaT
dtype: timedelta64[ns], type: Series), func (value: <built-in function mul>, type: builtin_function_or_method), left (value:   0  1
0  1  2
1  3  4, type: DataFrame), axis (value: 'columns', type: str)
Rational: The input parameters provide information about the input Series, DataFrame, and axis being used in the function.

- Output: right (value: array(['NaT', 'NaT'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]'), type: ndarray), a (value:   0  1
0  1  2
1  3  4, type: DataFrame), b (value: array(['NaT', 'NaT'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]'), type: ndarray)
Rational: The output values help to identify what the function is doing with the input parameters and what might be causing the bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided information, it is apparent that the "dispatch_to_series" function has a bug. In Expected Case 1, the variable "right" is of type Series, and when it's being used in the "column_op" function, the expected output should be a DataFrame. However, the function does not return a DataFrame as expected. Furthermore, the variable "expressions" has an incorrect expected value, which indicates that the function is not working properly. These discrepancies highlight the presence of a bug in the function.
