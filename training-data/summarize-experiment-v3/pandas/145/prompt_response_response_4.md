## Bug Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the "column_op" function not returning the expected output type, which should be a DataFrame. Additionally, the "expressions" module may not be used correctly, leading to an incorrect expected value. These discrepancies suggest that the function is not working as intended, leading to a type error when calling the function.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the "column_op" function returns a DataFrame as expected based on the input parameters. Additionally, you must re-evaluate the usage of the "expressions" module to ensure that it is used correctly to reflect the expected behavior.

## Corrected Code

After analyzing the bug and based on the provided information, here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The key fix in the corrected code is the modification of the "column_op" functions to ensure that they return a DataFrame as expected based on the input parameters. The use of the "expressions" module remains the same, as it was assumed to be working as intended.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected when handling different types of inputs for the "right" parameter.
