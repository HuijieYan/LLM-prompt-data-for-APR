Based on the provided information, it is apparent that the "dispatch_to_series" function has a bug. In Expected Case 1, the variable "right" is of type Series, and when it's being used in the "column_op" function, the expected output should be a DataFrame. However, the function does not return a DataFrame as expected. Furthermore, the variable "expressions" has an incorrect expected value, which indicates that the function is not working properly. These discrepancies highlight the presence of a bug in the function.
