The error occurs when calling the `dispatch_to_series` function from DataFrame arithmetic, specifically in the line `result = df * ser`. The error is a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for multiplication. The highest frames pointing to the error are in the pandas source code in the function `na_arithmetic_op`, and more precisely, in `expressions.py` and `array_ops.py`. The error seems to stem from handling `NaT` (Not a Time) values alongside numpy array operations.
