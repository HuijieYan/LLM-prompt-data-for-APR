The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to its handling of different types of input `right` and the subsequent operations performed using the `column_op` function. The function does not seem to return the expected DataFrame output in some cases, leading to the error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic and assertions related to the different types of input `right`.
2. Ensure that the `column_op` function returns a DataFrame in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        return left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        return left.apply(lambda col, other=right: func(col, other))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        return left.apply(lambda col, other=right: func(col, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        return left.apply(lambda col, other=right: func(col, other))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
```

In the corrected code, the `dispatch_to_series` function now uses the `apply` method to perform the operations on the DataFrame columns based on the type of input `right`. This ensures that the function returns the expected DataFrame output for each case, addressing the bug.
