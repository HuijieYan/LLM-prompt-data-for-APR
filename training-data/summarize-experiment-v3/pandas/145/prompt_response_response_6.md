The potential cause of the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function could be the incorrect handling of the `right` parameter when it is of type Series, leading to a mismatch in return types and incorrect processing of the input.

One approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the function `column_op(a, b)` returns a DataFrame when `right` is of type Series. This would involve modifying the logic within the function to properly handle the different types of the `right` parameter and ensure that the return type matches the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, when the `right` parameter is of type Series, the `column_op` function now explicitly constructs a DataFrame from the applied function results for each column. Additionally, all other cases are handled as before to maintain compatibility with different types of `right` parameters.
