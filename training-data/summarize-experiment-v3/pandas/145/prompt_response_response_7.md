There is a bug within the `dispatch_to_series` function that is causing the `TypeError` to occur. The issue seems to be related to handling `NaT` (Not a Time) values alongside numpy array operations. The function `column_op` is expected to return a dictionary with the column index as the key and the result of the operation as the value, but it seems to be returning an incorrect data type. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to construct a DataFrame from the dictionary and then return it. Additionally, the `expressions` module is being used to evaluate the column-wise operations, but the way it is being used might be causing the bug. We should revisit the usage of the `expressions` module and ensure that it is working correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return pd.DataFrame({i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))})

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version of `dispatch_to_series`, the `column_op` function now constructs a DataFrame from the dictionary comprehension and returns it. Additionally, the `expressions.evaluate` call is retained, but we need to verify if the `expressions` module is being adequately utilized, which might require further investigation.
