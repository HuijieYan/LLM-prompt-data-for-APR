Class docstring: The class TimeGrouper serves as a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, with parameters for frequency, closed end of interval, label, and convention.

`_get_time_bins(self, ax)` function: This function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of DatetimeIndex, and then calculates time bins based on the input.

`_get_timestamp_range_edges(first, last, offset, closed='left', base=0)`: This function seems to calculate the range edges for timestamps based on the first and last timestamps, as well as an offset.

`ax(self)`: This function doesn't seem to be directly related to the buggy function.

`_adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)`: This function is called within the `_get_time_bins` function, and it appears to be involved in adjusting bin edges based on the input.

These related functions and class provide context for the `_get_time_bins` function, showing how it interacts with other functions and classes within the codebase.
