## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_34/pandas/core/resample.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: The class TimeGrouper serves as a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, with parameters for frequency, closed end of interval, label, and convention.

`_get_time_bins(self, ax)` function: This function checks if the input `ax` is an instance of DatetimeIndex, and then calculates time bins based on the input.

`_get_timestamp_range_edges(first, last, offset, closed='left', base=0)`: This function seems to calculate the range edges for timestamps based on the first and last timestamps, as well as an offset.

`ax(self)`: This function doesn't seem to be directly related to the buggy function.

`_adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)`: This function is called within the `_get_time_bins` function, and it appears to be involved in adjusting bin edges based on the input.

These related functions and class provide context for the `_get_time_bins` function, showing how it interacts with other functions and classes within the codebase.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `test_datetime_index.py` produces an `AmbiguousTimeError` when down-sampling a DataFrame, due to a failure caused by a bug in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file, specifically at line 1425, which then reverts to the `date_range` in the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` file, line 966. The error occurs while attempting to infer dst time from a specific timestamp, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`, and the error originates from the `tz_localize_to_utc` function in the `pandas/_libs/tslibs/tzconversion.pyx` file.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters:
    - ax (value: DatetimeIndex([...], freq='H', tz='America/Havana'), type: DatetimeIndex)
- Output:
    - binner (value: DatetimeIndex([...], freq='D', tz='America/Havana'), type: DatetimeIndex)
    - labels (value: DatetimeIndex([...], freq='D', tz='America/Havana'), type: DatetimeIndex)
    - bins (value: [16, 41, 49], type: ndarray)
Rational: The output values binner, labels, and bins are relevant to the bug as they are derived from the input parameter ax, which is the source of the issue.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Code Sample
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
start = datetime(2018, 11, 3, 12)
end = datetime(2018, 11, 5, 12)
index = pd.date_range(start, end, freq="1H")
index = index.tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert('America/Havana')
data = list(range(len(index)))
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)
groups = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='1D'))

Problem description
On a long clock-change day in Cuba, e.g 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. pd.Grouper does not handle this as I expect. More precisely the call to groupby in the code above raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

This issue is of a similar nature to #23742 but it seems #23742 was fixed in 0.24 whereas this was not.

Expected Output
The call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of november). The group for the 4th of november should be labelled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (that is the first midnight, before the clock change) and it should contain the 25 hourly data points for this day.
