## Bug's Cause Elucidation

The bug appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` is calling the `round` method on a DataFrame, but this operation in turn calls `get_indexer` internally, which then raises a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. The bug is likely related to the handling of closed intervals, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the values of the 'closed' attribute between the input and output.

This issue may arise from incorrect processing of different cases such as overlapping or non-overlapping intervals, handling homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes, and utilizing an internal engine within the `get_indexer` method. The `target_as_index.values` being incompatible with the method's signature could also be a potential cause of the issue.


## Approaches for fixing the bug

1. Examine and verify the data types of 'closed' and 'values' attributes to ensure compatibility with the method's signature.
2. Check the logic for dealing with overlapping and non-overlapping intervals to ensure that it handles the cases correctly.
3. Verify the processing of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes and the usage of the internal engine to identify any potential issues.
4. Consider updating the logic within the method to better handle the different cases and ensure compatibility with the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.


## Corrected Code

After analyzing the bug and its potential causes, the following corrected version of the `get_indexer` method is provided:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed:
            raise ValueError("Closed attribute mismatch between source and target IntervalIndex")

        if self.dtype.subtype != target_as_index.dtype.subtype:
            raise ValueError("Incompatible subtype between source and target IntervalIndex")

        indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        for i, (start, stop) in enumerate(self):
            matches = (target_as_index.left < stop) & (target_as_index.right > start)
            indexer[matches] = i

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code:
- Additional checks are added to ensure that the 'closed' attribute and the subtype of the IntervalIndex are compatible between the source and target IntervalIndex.
- The logic for determining the indexer when the target index is also an IntervalIndex is updated to correctly identify matching intervals based on their start and stop values.
- Error handling and appropriate exception raising are also added where necessary.

With these corrections, the `get_indexer` method should now be able to handle the various cases more effectively and ensure compatibility with other methods such as the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
