Class docstring: The `IntervalIndex` class represents an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. It has related methods such as `left()`, `right()`, `closed()`, `values()`, `dtype()`, `is_overlapping()`, `get_loc()`, `get_indexer()`, `where()`, `equals()`, `_maybe_convert_i8()`, and `_check_method()`.

`def left(self)`, `def right(self)`, `def closed(self)`, `def values(self)`, `def dtype(self)`, `def is_overlapping()`: These functions likely serve as accessors for the properties and characteristics of the intervals in the `IntervalIndex` class.

`def get_loc(self, key: Any, method: Optional[str]=None, tolerance=None) -> Union[int, slice, np.ndarray]`: This function likely retrieves the location of a given key within the `IntervalIndex`.

`def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray`: This function may be responsible for generating an index based on a target object, and it seems to rely on other internal methods for its behavior. 

`def _engine(self)`: This function is perhaps a low-level engine or helper for `get_indexer()`.

`log_action()` function call: Not present in the given code, but if existent, it could be used to log details of the intervals.

The `get_indexer()` function has complex logic that handles various cases such as overlapping or non-overlapping intervals, handling homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes, and utilizing an internal engine. Therefore, the issue in the `get_indexer()` function might stem from incorrect processing of these different cases, leading to unexpected behaviors or errors. The cause of the failure should be investigated within the `get_indexer()` method and its interactions with other methods and the `IntervalIndex` class.
