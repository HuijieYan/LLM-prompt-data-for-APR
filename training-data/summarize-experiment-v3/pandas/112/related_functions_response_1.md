The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is calling several other functions within the same file, such as `_engine`, `left`, `right`, `closed`, `values`, and `dtype`. These functions likely perform operations related to handling intervals and indexes. Additionally, the buggy function is calling methods like `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `_check_method`, `get_loc`, `where`, and `equals`. It seems that these functions play a role in processing and comparing different indexes or intervals.

The `get_indexer` function appears to be handling the retrieval of indices for a target, based on certain conditions and the properties of the interval index. It also seems to handle cases where there are overlapping or non-overlapping intervals, and it makes a distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.

In order to understand why the `get_indexer` function is failing, it is important to investigate how these related functions and methods are interacting with each other, what data they are processing, and whether there are any discrepancies in the input parameters or logic.
