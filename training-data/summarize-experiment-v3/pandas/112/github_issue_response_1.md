The issue stems from the `get_indexer` function, specifically the line `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):`. When the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `get_indexer` function encounters a TypeError, causing the round method to fail. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to round the data. The bug is likely related to how the function handles `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to the failure of the round method in this specific scenario.
