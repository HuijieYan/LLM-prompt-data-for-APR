The buggy function `get_indexer` in the file pandas/core/indexes/interval.py has several discrepancies between the current and expected outputs. For example, when `target` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`, the function is expected to return specific index matching based on the comparison of left and right values; however, the current implementation does not align with the expected behavior. Additionally, there are discrepancies in handling non-overlapping intervals, and the behavior for heterogeneous scalar indexes also does not match the expected output. These discrepancies need to be addressed in order to fix the function's bug.
