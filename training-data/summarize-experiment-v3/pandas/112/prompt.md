## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Based on the error message and the stack trace, the issue appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, the error is caused by a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found" when trying to get the indexer, in the `pandas/_libs/intervaltree.pxi` file. The failing test is related to rounding interval category columns, and the error occurs during the execution of the `df.round()` method in the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test case.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:

### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
- self.is_overlapping, value: `False`, type: `bool`
- self.closed, value: `'right'`, type: `str`
- target_as_index, value: `IntervalIndex([(0, 1], (1, 2]], closed='right', dtype='interval[int64]')`, type: `IntervalIndex`

### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
- target_as_index.closed, value: `'right'`, type: `str`
- target_as_index.values, value: `<IntervalArray> [(0, 1], (1, 2]] Length: 2, closed: right, dtype: interval[int64]`, type: `IntervalArray`

Rational: The bug might be related to the handling of closed intervals, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the values of the 'closed' attribute between the input and output.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

The issue stems from the `get_indexer` function, specifically the line `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):`. When the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `get_indexer` function encounters a TypeError, causing the round method to fail. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to round the data. The bug is likely related to how the function handles `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to the failure of the round method in this specific scenario.
