Based on the error message and the stack trace, the issue appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` is calling the `round` method on a DataFrame, but this operation in turn calls `get_indexer` internally, which then raises a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. The bug is located in the `IntervalIndex.get_indexer` method, possibly due to the `target_as_index.values` being incompatible with the method's signature.
