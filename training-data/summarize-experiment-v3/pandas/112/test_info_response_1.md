Based on the error message and the stack trace, the issue appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, the error is caused by a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found" when trying to get the indexer, in the `pandas/_libs/intervaltree.pxi` file. The failing test is related to rounding interval category columns, and the error occurs during the execution of the `df.round()` method in the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test case.
