At first glance, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference 'period' that is created inside the `_engine` function. The weak reference is being created from the 'self' parameter, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being preserved correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error when accessing the 'view' attribute in the 'PeriodEngine' of the `_engine` method.

To fix this issue, the weak reference 'period' should be created and handled properly to avoid the reference cycle problem. This would involve ensuring that the weak reference is maintained and used appropriately within the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weak reference 'period' is now correctly invoked as a callable using `period()`, which ensures that the weak reference is used to access the original object it refers to without encountering a `NoneType` error.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `_engine` method functions as expected, passing the failing test case and providing the correct output.
