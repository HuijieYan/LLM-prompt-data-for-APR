Based on the error message, the failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105. It seems that the bug is closely related to the 'is_monotonic' method of the 'IndexEngine' in the 'base.py' file. The error is caused by an 'AttributeError' of the 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute, which leads to a failure in the 'PeriodEngine' of the '_engine' method in the source code.
