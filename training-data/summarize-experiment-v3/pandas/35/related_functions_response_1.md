Class docstring: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It also includes a list of attributes and methods for working with periods.

`_engine` function: This function is a property method with caching enabled, and it is used to access the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current `PeriodIndex` and its length as parameters. The implementation details of `_engine_type` are not relevant at this level.

`@cache_readonly` decorator: This decorator indicates that the `_engine` property method should be cached, allowing for improved performance by only computing the value once and then reusing it on subsequent access.

`_engine_type` class: This class is likely used to create and manage the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. The details of its implementation are not directly related to the current issue with the `_engine` property method.

Overall, the `PeriodIndex` class contains several attributes and methods for working with periods, and the `_engine` property method is responsible for providing access to the underlying engine used within the class. The issue in the `_engine` function should be investigated in the context of how it interacts with the `_engine_type` and other internal workings of the `PeriodIndex` class.
