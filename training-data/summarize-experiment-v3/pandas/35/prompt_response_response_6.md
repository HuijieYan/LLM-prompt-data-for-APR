## Bug Cause

The potential error location within the buggy function is the creation of the weak reference 'period'. The issue is likely caused by the weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

### Bug Cause Analysis
(a) The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference of `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` as a parameter. However, if the weak reference is not properly maintained, it could result in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a NoneType instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

(b) From the `PeriodIndex` class docs, we understand that weak references are used to avoid reference cycles, but if not handled properly, they can lead to unexpected behavior such as the dropping of a weakly referenced object.

(c) The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is failing at line 105. The error is caused by an 'AttributeError' of the 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.

(d) The corresponding error message indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a NoneType instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

(e) The actual input/output variable values are: 
   - `self._values` (value: ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], type: PeriodArray)
   - `self` (value: PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC'), type: PeriodIndex)

(f) The expected input/output variable values are not explicitly provided, but based on the failing test, the expected behavior is for the `is_monotonic` property of the `PeriodEngine` to return True.

(g) The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" highlights the issue by providing a code example and an expected output. The problem description indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely. This may involve revisiting the implementation of weak references and their interaction with the `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Code

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Creating a strong reference to self to avoid premature dropping of the weak reference
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, we avoid the premature dropping of the weak reference, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` without any NoneType issues. This will resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.

This corrected code should address the weak reference handling issue and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
