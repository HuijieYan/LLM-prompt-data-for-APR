## Bug's Cause

The bug is likely caused by the weak referencing of the PeriodIndex within the `_engine` method. As per the GitHub issue description, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex, which causes the error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The error is occurring in the `_engine` method (property method), where the weak reference `period` is being assigned, and it seems that the weak reference is not being maintained or accessed properly.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be maintained properly to avoid it being dropped prematurely. This may require a change within the caching mechanism used by the `@cache_readonly` decorator, or a more careful handling of the weak reference within the `_engine` method.

Additionally, it may be necessary to review the implementation of the `_engine_type` class to ensure that it properly handles the weak reference to the PeriodIndex and does not inadvertently drop the reference prematurely.

## Corrected Code

```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

class PeriodIndex:
    # Other class methods and properties...

    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Other relevant classes and methods...

```

In the corrected code, the weak reference `period` is maintained within the `_engine` property method. This ensures that the reference cycle is avoided and the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is accessible when passed to the `_engine_type` class. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allow the `_engine` method to function as expected without causing the AttributeError.
