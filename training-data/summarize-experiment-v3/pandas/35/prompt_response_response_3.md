To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, it is important to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` variable (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`) is properly maintained and utilized to avoid any reference cycle issues. 

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being handled properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` value instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to properly create and manage the weak reference to the `self` variable. This can be achieved by using the `weakref.proxy` function to create a proxy reference that does not introduce a reference cycle.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.proxy`, ensuring that a reference cycle is avoided while still allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `_engine` function behaves as expected, providing the correct underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class.
