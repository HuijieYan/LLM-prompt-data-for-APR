Based on the analysis, the potential error in the buggy function is in the creation of the weak reference 'period'. It appears that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to a NoneType object being passed to the _engine_type.

The issue is likely caused by a reference cycle problem, where the weak reference is being dropped before it should be.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly maintained to avoid the NoneType object being passed to the _engine_type.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, maintain a weak reference of self using a local variable.
    _self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(_self, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference using a local variable, the issue with the NoneType object being passed to the _engine_type should be resolved. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
