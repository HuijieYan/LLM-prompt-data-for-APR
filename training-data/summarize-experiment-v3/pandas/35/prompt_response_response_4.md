Based on the given information, it seems like the bug is occurring due to the weak reference not being properly created and utilized within the `_engine` function. This can cause the reference to be dropped instead of being used as intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the PeriodIndex, which results in the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, it is important to ensure that the weak reference is created and used correctly within the `_engine` function. Therefore, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly create the weak reference and pass it to the `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Creating a weak reference of self to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Passing the weak reference to _engine_type if it's not None
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where weak reference is None
        # You may raise an error or handle it as per the requirements
        pass
```

In the corrected code, we first create a weak reference `period` of the `self` object. Then, before passing it to `_engine_type`, we check if the weak reference is not `None`. If it is not `None`, we pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. If the weak reference is `None`, you can either raise an error or handle it according to the requirements of the application.

By ensuring that the weak reference is properly created and utilized, the bug should be addressed, and the failing test case should be resolved.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the program passes the failing test.
