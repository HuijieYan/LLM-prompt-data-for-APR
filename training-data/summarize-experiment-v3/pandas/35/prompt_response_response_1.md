The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of the weakref.ref() function. It seems that the weak reference 'period' is not being utilized correctly, which could be leading to the reference cycle issue.

The bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function: The use of weakref.ref(self) to create a weak reference to the 'self' object.
(b) The buggy class docs: No specific details provided on the internal implementation of weak references or the use of weak references within the PeriodIndex class.
(c) The failing test: The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105, related to the 'is_monotonic' method of the 'IndexEngine' in the 'base.py' file.
(d) The corresponding error message: The error is caused by an 'AttributeError' of the 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute, leading to a failure in the 'PeriodEngine' of the '_engine' method in the source code.
(e) The actual input/output variable values: self._values (value: ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], type: PeriodArray), self (value: PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC'), type: PeriodIndex).
(f) The expected input/output variable values: The expected behavior or output of the function is not explicitly provided.
(g) The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes a situation where weakly referenced objects are being dropped before intended, leading to a None being received by the PeriodEngine, causing an error.

To fix the bug, the usage of weak references needs to be carefully examined and adjusted to ensure that the weak reference 'period' is maintained as needed.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the weakref.ref() function has been replaced with weakref.proxy() to create a weak reference to the 'self' object. This should help in avoiding the reference cycle issue and ensure that the weak reference 'period' is maintained as intended.
