Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class. The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' is encountering an AttributeError on a NoneType object, which suggests that the weak reference 'period' is being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference 'period' is maintained and used appropriately within the _engine function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the underlying PeriodEngine receives the correct input without encountering a NoneType object.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we have added parentheses to `period` when calling it as a function to get the actual weakly referenced object. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized within the function.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the expected PeriodIndex object.
