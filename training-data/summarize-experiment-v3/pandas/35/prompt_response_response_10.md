The potential error location in the buggy function is the creation of the weak reference 'period' inside the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This reference is then used to initialize the `_engine_type` class, which is leading to the 'NoneType' object error when accessing the 'view' attribute.

The bug's cause is related to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the error when accessing the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to 'self' is properly maintained to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
from weakref import ProxyType

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = ProxyType(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `ProxyType` from the `weakref` module, we can create a weak reference to 'self' and pass it to the `_engine_type` without the risk of it being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure the proper functioning of the `_engine` method for the `PeriodIndex` class.
