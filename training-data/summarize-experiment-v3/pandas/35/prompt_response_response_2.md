The potential error location within the buggy function is the initialization of the weak reference 'period' using a weakref.ref(self). It's possible that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the 'NoneType' object error when accessing the 'view' attribute.

The bug's cause is related to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped too early, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a 'NoneType' instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is properly maintained throughout the engine's usage.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period is not None else None
```
By adding a condition to check if the weak reference 'period' is not 'None', we can prevent the 'NoneType' object error and ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is maintained.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test case to pass.
