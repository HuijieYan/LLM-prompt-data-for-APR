## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It also includes a list of attributes and methods for working with periods.

`_engine` function: This function is a property method with caching enabled, and it is used to access the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current `PeriodIndex` and its length as parameters. The implementation details of `_engine_type` are not relevant at this level.

`@cache_readonly` decorator: This decorator indicates that the `_engine` property method should be cached, allowing for improved performance by only computing the value once and then reusing it on subsequent access.

`_engine_type` class: This class is likely used to create and manage the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. The details of its implementation are not directly related to the current issue with the `_engine` property method.

Overall, the `PeriodIndex` class contains several attributes and methods for working with periods, and the `_engine` property method is responsible for providing access to the underlying engine used within the class. The issue in the `_engine` function should be investigated in the context of how it interacts with the `_engine_type` and other internal workings of the `PeriodIndex` class.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Based on the error message, the failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105. It seems that the bug is closely related to the 'is_monotonic' method of the 'IndexEngine' in the 'base.py' file. The error is caused by an 'AttributeError' of the 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute, which leads to a failure in the 'PeriodEngine' of the '_engine' method in the source code.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- self._values (value: ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], type: PeriodArray)
- self (value: PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC'), type: PeriodIndex)

Rational: The input parameters self._values and self are being used to initialize the variable 'period' inside the function. These values are relevant as they directly impact the creation of the weak reference 'period', which could be causing the reference cycle issue.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the provided source code of the function, the expected case 1 reflects the input parameter `self` as a PeriodIndex with values '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'. However, the actual function's behavior and output are not provided, making it difficult to identify any discrepancies. To effectively analyze the runtime information and identify the bug, it is important to have access to the actual function's output and behavior in relation to the expected output provided.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
As per comment by @jacobaustin123:
import pandas as pd
idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([pd.PeriodIndex([pd.Period("2019Q1"), pd.Period("2019Q2")], name='b')])
idx2 = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])
all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels) # raises an error

Problem description
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex er dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Expected Output
The above should return True.
```
