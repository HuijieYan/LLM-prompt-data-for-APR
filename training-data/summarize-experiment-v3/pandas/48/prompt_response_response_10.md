## Bug Cause

The bug is likely caused by the inappropriate type casting from `float64` to `int64` within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with safely casting a non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`, leading to the `TypeError` when calling the `mean` function after grouping.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the appropriate type casting is performed, and non-equivalent types are handled properly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype.kind == 'f':
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Existing code...
}
```

The changes include added condition to check if `result` is of non-equivalent type, where we ensure the type is correctly cast using `astype` before creating the `agg_block`. This modification should fix the issue by handling the type casting appropriately.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the code passes the failing test cases.
