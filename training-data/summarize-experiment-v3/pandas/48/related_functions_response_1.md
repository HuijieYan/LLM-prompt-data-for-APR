Class docstring: The `DataFrameGroupBy` class likely performs operations on grouped data, such as aggregations and transformations.

`aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs)`: This function likely performs aggregation operations on the grouped data, possibly utilizing the specified function and additional arguments and keyword arguments.

`_get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager`: This function likely retrieves the data to be aggregated from the `BlockManager`, which could be used as input for the aggregation process.

`_cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]"`: The buggy function performs aggregation on data blocks using the specified parameters. It interacts with the `aggregate` function and `_get_data_to_aggregate` to carry out the aggregation process. The issue causing the failure likely lies within the implementation of this function.
