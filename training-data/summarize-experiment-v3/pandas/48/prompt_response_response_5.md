## Bug Cause

The bug appears to be caused due to the incorrect implementation of the algorithm for computing variance within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Specifically, the line `result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)` seems to be causing the issue, as it tries to cast float values to int64, resulting in the error: "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'".

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the algorithm for computing variance within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated. The function should properly handle the cast of float values to int64, ideally converting the result to a compatible data type rather than triggering the error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if result is not no_result:        
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        elif isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim > 1:
            result = np.mean(result, axis=1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
``` 

By handling the conversion of the result to a compatible data type as shown in the corrected code, the bug related to safely casting non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` can be resolved.

This fix should address the reported issue on GitHub as well.
