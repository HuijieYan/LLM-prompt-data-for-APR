The failing test cases shows that the stack trace points to the _from_sequence method in the buggy function. This method uses an internal helper function coerce_to_array and that uses the safe_cast function, which when called, returns an error with message "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'". This message is the direct cause of the exceptions raised. The failing test cases repeatedly fail for different function inputs such as 'mean', 'median', and 'var', due to the failing _from_sequence method. This error occurs because the safe_cast function cannot safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`. Therefore, this pattern of errors from the test cases should be diagnosed for the cause of the bug in the method at the address in the code. The main method agg_blocks in the function _cython_agg_blocks is related to the error messages. The agg_blocks input coming into this method appears to have a sufficient number of float values to cast, which in turn triggers the error. For the current state of 'cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64', the specific error location needs to be identified, and the error should be checked to be raised properly based on the exception's details.
