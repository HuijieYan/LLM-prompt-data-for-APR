The relevant input/output values for the bug seem to be:
- Input parameters: numeric_only (value: True, type: bool), how (value: 'var', type: str), min_count (value: -1, type: int), self.obj (DataFrame), self.axis (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: result (value: array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]), type: ndarray)

Rational: The output value for the 'var' calculation is consistently not correct (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) across multiple cases, which suggests that there's a bug in the calculation logic for finding the variance. This indicates that there may be an issue with the algorithm for computing variance within the function.
