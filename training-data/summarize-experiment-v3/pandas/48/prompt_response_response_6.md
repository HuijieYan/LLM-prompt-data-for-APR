## Bug Cause

The bug in the provided function is caused by the improper handling of the `block` datatype, resulting in an error when trying to cast a non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`. This is due to a miscalculation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that leads to the erroneous generation of the `agg_blocks` output.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To resolve the bug, the algorithm for computing the aggregation should be reviewed. Specifically, the calculations for variance and type casting from `float64` to `int64` need to be correctly implemented to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code streamlines the process for aggregating the numeric data blocks and handles the calculation of the aggregated results more effectively.

This fix aims to resolve the reported Error message "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'".
