## Bug Cause

The bug appears to be related to the inability of the `DataFrame.quantile()` method to handle datetime data, where it raises a `ValueError` during the quantile computation. The issue seems to be specific to the interaction of the `quantile` method with datetime data, as indicated by the failing test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns`.

Additionally, within the `quantile` method, the initialization of the data structure using the `_constructor` function and the computation of quantiles with the `self._data.quantile()` method might be contributing to the bug. It seems that the `quantile` method is unable to handle empty data when computing the quantile, leading to the `ValueError`.

## Suggested Approach for Fixing the Bug

A potential approach to resolving the bug might involve modifying the `DataFrame.quantile()` method to handle datetime data specifically, ensuring that the quantile computation does not encounter the `ValueError` when working with datetime values. Additionally, reviewing the interactions within the `quantile` method, especially with respect to the initialization process and data structure, could provide insights into resolving the bug.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `DataFrame.quantile()` method, addressing the bug related to datetime data:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    (Previous function implementation)
    ...

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and data.empty:  # Check if the DataFrame is empty
        return pd.DataFrame()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if not result:  # Check if the result is empty
        return pd.DataFrame()
    elif result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result

```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to handle the scenario where the DataFrame is empty, ensuring that the quantile computation does not encounter the `ValueError`. The code also includes a check to handle the case where the result is empty, returning an empty DataFrame accordingly.

This corrected code aims to resolve the bug related to the `DataFrame.quantile()` method's handling of datetime data and empty data scenarios, ensuring that the function can handle a wider range of input data types and edge cases.
