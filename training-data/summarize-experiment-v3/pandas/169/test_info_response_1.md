The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is triggering an error in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. The error originates from the `quantile` method in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file, which invokes the `quantile` from the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. This, in turn, calls `concat_compat` in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file. The error message indicates a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate." Based on the error stack trace, it seems that the `quantile` method is unable to handle empty data when computing the quantile, leading to the `ValueError`.
