Class DataFrame docstring: Provides an overview of the DataFrame class, detailing its properties and capabilities.

`def _constructor(self)`: This function is a part of the DataFrame class and is likely used for initializing the class.

`def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear')`: This function is also a part of the DataFrame class and is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over the requested axis. It involves several parameters such as q, axis, numeric_only, and interpolation, and performs calculations on the data to return the desired quantiles.

The interaction of the `def quantile()` function with the `_constructor` function and the data attributes within the DataFrame class might be impacting its functionality. Understanding how the computations in the `def quantile()` function rely on the initialization process from the `_constructor` function and the data structure within the DataFrame class could provide insights into the source of the bug.
