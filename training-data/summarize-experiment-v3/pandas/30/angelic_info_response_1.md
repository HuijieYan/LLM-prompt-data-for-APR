In the provided case, the function is expected to convert the input data into a date format. However, the current output does not match the expected output. Despite the input parameter values and types being as expected, the variables right before the function's return do not match the expected values and types. The `new_data` variable is expected to be of type `RangeIndex` but is not, `new_data.dtype` is expected to be `dtype('int64')` but is not, `in_range` is expected to be `array([False, False, False])` but is not, and `new_data._values` is expected to be `array([0, 1, 2])` but is not. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working as intended for the given input.
