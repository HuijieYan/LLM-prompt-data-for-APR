## Bug's Cause

The bug's cause is rooted in the conditional statement in the `if` block of the `_try_convert_to_date` function. Specifically, the code intended to handle the conversion of boolean values to dates is not functioning as expected, leading to the incorrect output of the function.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the conditional statement to correctly handle boolean values and prevent their conversion to datetime.
2. Perform type checking on the input data to ensure that the correct conversions are applied based on the data type.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore boolean values and numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, bool):
        return data, False

    in_range = (
        isna(new_data._values)
        | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        | (new_data._values == iNaT)
    )
    if not in_range.all():
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code includes the following changes:
1. Added an additional condition to the `if` statement checking the data type, which handles boolean values explicitly and prevents their conversion to datetime.
2. Removed the erroneous conditional statement that resulted in an incorrect conversion of boolean values.
3. Ensured that the function now handles boolean values appropriately by returning `False` for the boolean input data, as it is not convertible to datetime.

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the input data and prevent boolean values from being erroneously converted to datetime, thereby addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
