## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` attribute being `None` in certain cases, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function. This is evident from the failing test case, where the error message states that `to_bytes` must receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, but it received a `NoneType` instead.

## Approach to Fix

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` and ensure that it is converted to the appropriate data type before trying to manipulate it. We can use the `to_bytes` function to safely handle the conversion and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

## Corrected Code

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    s = method + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we use the `to_bytes` function to convert the `parsed.hostname` attribute to bytes only if it is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and ensures that the function works as expected in handling the HTTP representation of the request.
