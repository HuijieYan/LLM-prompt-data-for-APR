## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is likely related to the handling of the `parsed.hostname` attribute, which is resulting in a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function. This is indicated by the failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file, with the error message indicating that `to_bytes` must receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, but it received a NoneType.

The relevant input/output variable values are:
- Request (value `<GET file:///tmp/foo.txt>`, type: `Request`)
- request.method (value: `'GET'`, type: `str`)
- request.headers (value: `{}`, type: `Headers`)
- request.body (value: `b''`, type: `bytes`)
- Output: s (value: `b'GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n'`, type: `bytes`)

The actual issue is likely related to the `parsed.hostname` attribute being `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `parsed.hostname` attribute needs to be properly checked for `None` before passing it to the `to_bytes` function. This can be done using a conditional check to ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the conditional check ensures that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected code should pass the failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request'.
