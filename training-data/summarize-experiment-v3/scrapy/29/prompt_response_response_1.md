## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the 'parsed.hostname' attribute being set to None, which leads to a TypeError when the 'to_bytes' function is called with it as an argument within the 'request_httprepr' function.

## Approach to Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is None and provide a default value for it.

## The corrected code

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or b'') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- A default value of an empty byte string is provided for 'parsed.hostname' using the `or` operator to handle the case where it is None.
- This prevents the TypeError from occurring when passing 'parsed.hostname' to the 'to_bytes' function.
- This change ensures that the program will pass the failing test.
