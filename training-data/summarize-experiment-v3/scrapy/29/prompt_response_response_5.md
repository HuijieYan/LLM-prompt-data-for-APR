## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the 'parsed.hostname' attribute being None, and the 'to_bytes' function does not handle a NoneType input, leading to the 'TypeError'.


## Approach to Fix

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when 'parsed.hostname' is None and convert it to an empty string before passing it to the 'to_bytes' function.


## The corrected code

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected code makes use of a conditional statement to check if 'parsed.hostname' is None. If it is None, it assigns an empty byte string to 'hostname', otherwise, it converts 'parsed.hostname' to bytes using the 'to_bytes' function. This modification ensures that the 'to_bytes' function does not receive a NoneType input, thus fixing the TypeError.
