Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.


Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The failing test, 
   (c) The corresponding error message, 
   (d) The actual input/output variable values

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test




## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/scrapy_29/scrapy/utils/request.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error is triggered by the 'to_bytes(parsed.hostname)' part of the 'request_httprepr' function. Therefore, the bug is closely related to the handling of the 'hostname' attribute within the 'request_httprepr' function which causes the 'TypeError'. The error message could be simplified as 'TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, got NoneType'.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Request (value `<GET file:///tmp/foo.txt>`, type: `Request`)
- request.method (value: `'GET'`, type: `str`)
- request.headers (value: `{}`, type: `Headers`)
- request.body (value: `b''`, type: `bytes`)
- Output: s (value: `b'GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n'`, type: `bytes`)

Rational: The function appears to replace the scheme value in the output `s` by "HTTP" even though it should maintain the original value of the input. This may indicate the presence of a bug in the handling of the URL scheme in the `request_httprepr` function.
