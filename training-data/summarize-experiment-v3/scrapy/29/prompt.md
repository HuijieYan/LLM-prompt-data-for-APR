Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

    def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):

        request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
        request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request in file tests/test_utils_request.py, line 76, calls the function request_httprepr from scrapy/utils/request.py, line 82, which results in a TypeError for input type NoneType in the to_bytes function from scrapy/utils/python.py, leading to a failure.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant values are:
- Input parameters: request, request.method, request.headers, request.body
- Output: s
Rational: The bug appears to be in the construction of the HTTP request line, as the hostname is not properly handled, leading to incorrect HTTP representation for ftp requests.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the given code, the 'request_httprepr' function is expected to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, based on the provided cases, it fails to produce the expected output. For example, in the first case with input parameter value -5, the expected value of y is also -5, but the function returns a different value. Similarly, in the second case with input parameter value 0, the expected output is 0, but the function again returns a different value. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working correctly and needs to be debugged.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Based on the GitHub issue description, the bug in the `request_httprepr` function seems to be related to the incorrect construction of the HTTP request. The issue mentions that when a request is made with an empty body, the function does not handle it properly, and it leads to a malformed HTTP request. Specifically, the issue indicates that the function does not check if the request body is None before attempting to concatenate it to the raw HTTP representation. This results in an error when trying to send the request. Therefore, the faulty behavior described in the issue is directly related to the incomplete handling of the request body in the `request_httprepr` function.
