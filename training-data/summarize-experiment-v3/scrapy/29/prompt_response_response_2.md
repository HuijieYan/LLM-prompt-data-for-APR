## Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function 'request_httprepr' seems to have a bug related to the 'parsed.hostname' attribute. The error occurs during the call to 'to_bytes(parsed.hostname)', which results in a 'TypeError'. It seems that the 'parsed.hostname' attribute is being set to 'None', causing the 'to_bytes' function to throw an error. This is evident from the error message: 'TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, got NoneType'.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the 'request_httprepr' function should handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is 'None'. This can be done by checking if 'parsed.hostname' is 'None', and setting a default value if necessary.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

The provided correction includes a conditional check to verify if 'parsed.hostname' exists before appending it to the output byte string. This will handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is 'None', preventing the 'TypeError' from occurring.
