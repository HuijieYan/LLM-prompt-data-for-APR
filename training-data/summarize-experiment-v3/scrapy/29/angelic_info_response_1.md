In the given code, the 'request_httprepr' function is expected to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, based on the provided cases, it fails to produce the expected output. For example, in the first case with input parameter value -5, the expected value of y is also -5, but the function returns a different value. Similarly, in the second case with input parameter value 0, the expected output is 0, but the function again returns a different value. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working correctly and needs to be debugged.
