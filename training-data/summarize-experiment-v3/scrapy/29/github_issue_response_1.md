Based on the GitHub issue description, the bug in the `request_httprepr` function seems to be related to the incorrect construction of the HTTP request. The issue mentions that when a request is made with an empty body, the function does not handle it properly, and it leads to a malformed HTTP request. Specifically, the issue indicates that the function does not check if the request body is None before attempting to concatenate it to the raw HTTP representation. This results in an error when trying to send the request. Therefore, the faulty behavior described in the issue is directly related to the incomplete handling of the request body in the `request_httprepr` function.
