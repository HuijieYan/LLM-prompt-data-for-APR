The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error is triggered by the 'to_bytes(parsed.hostname)' part of the 'request_httprepr' function. Therefore, the bug is closely related to the handling of the 'hostname' attribute within the 'request_httprepr' function which causes the 'TypeError'. The error message could be simplified as 'TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str, or bytes object, got NoneType'.
