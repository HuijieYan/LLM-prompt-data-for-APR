The bug appears to be caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` in certain cases, which leads to the `TypeError` raised by the `to_bytes` function. The `parsed.hostname` being `None` likely occurs when the URL does not include a hostname (e.g., `file:///tmp/foo.txt`).

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value or by skipping the `Host` header if the hostname is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and skip adding the `Host` header in such cases, ensuring that the function passes the failing test.
