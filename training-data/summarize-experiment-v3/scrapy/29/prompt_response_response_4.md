## Bug Fix

The bug seems to be related to the `parsed.hostname` attribute potentially being `None` which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` before using it in the `to_bytes` function, we ensure that the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This should fix the bug and make the program pass the failing test.
