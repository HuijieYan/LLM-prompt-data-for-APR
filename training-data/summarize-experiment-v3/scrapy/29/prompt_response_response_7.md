## Bug Fix

The bug in the code seems to be related to the handling of the parsed URL `hostname` attribute, which is causing the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `hostname` attribute is not `None` before converting it to bytes. Additionally, we need to handle the scheme and netloc values correctly to maintain the original values.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        netloc = parsed.hostname
        if parsed.port:
            netloc += ':' + str(parsed.port)
    else:
        netloc = parsed.netloc

    path = urlunparse((parsed.scheme, netloc, parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `parsed.hostname` attribute is checked for `None` before being converted to bytes, and the correct value is used for the `netloc` variable to maintain the original scheme and hostname values. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and ensure that the program passes the failing test.
