## Bug Fix

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the handling of the `parsed.hostname`. The error occurs when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to throw a `TypeError`. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value instead.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, we handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value of `b"localhost"` for the `host` variable. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and ensures that the `request_httprepr` function works as expected.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' passes successfully.
