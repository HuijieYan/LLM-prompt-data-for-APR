## Bug Cause

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of image mode conversion and thumbnail creation within the `convert_image` function. Specifically, the incorrect handling of RGBA images when creating a new background and pasting the original image, as well as not properly converting non-RGB images, causes discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.


## Approach to Fixing the Bug

1. Refactor the code to properly create a new RGBA background and paste the original image for the specific PNG and RGBA case.
2. Ensure that the function correctly converts images to RGB when their mode is not RGB and that thumbnail creation with the correct size and format is performed.


## Corrected Code

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected code addresses the buggy function by properly creating a new RGB background and pasting the original image for the PNG and RGBA case. It also ensures that image mode is correctly converted to RGB when necessary and that thumbnail creation with the correct size and format is performed.
