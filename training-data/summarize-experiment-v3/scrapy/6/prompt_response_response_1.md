## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of image format and mode, as well as the resizing operation.

In the provided function, there are issues with the conditional statements for handling different image formats and modes, as well as the thumbnail creation process. The function is not correctly converting the image to RGB if necessary, and it is not resizing the image properly when a size parameter is provided.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Check if the image format is 'PNG' and its mode is 'RGBA'. If so, create a new RGBA background image and paste the original image onto the background, then convert it to RGB. Otherwise, check if the image mode is not 'RGB', and convert it to 'RGB' if needed.
2. If the size parameter is provided, create a new image with the specified size and generate a buffer with the JPEG format.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle the different image formats, modes, and resizing operations, ensuring that it passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
