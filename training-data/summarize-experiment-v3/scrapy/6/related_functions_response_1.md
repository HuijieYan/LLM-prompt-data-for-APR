Class docstring: This class is an abstract pipeline that implements the logic for image thumbnail generation.

`def convert_image(self, image, size=None)`: This function takes an image object and an optional size parameter. It performs different operations on the image based on its format and mode, including converting it to RGB if necessary and resizing it if a size parameter is provided. Finally, it saves the image as a JPEG and returns the modified image and a buffer.

The `Image` class and its methods like `new`, `paste`, `convert`, `thumbnail`, and `save` are likely used within the `convert_image` function to perform the image manipulation operations.

The `FilesPipeline` class is likely the parent or base class of `ImagesPipeline`, as evident from the class declaration.
