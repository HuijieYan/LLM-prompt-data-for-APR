In case 3, the function should create a new RGBA background image and then convert it to RGB, returning the result. However, the current code does not create a new background image but instead pastes the original image onto itself, resulting in the expected output not being achieved. In case 4, the input image is not in RGB format, and the function is expected to convert it to RGB. However, the current implementation doesn't perform this conversion, leading to a discrepancy between the current and expected output. Additionally, in case 2, when a size parameter is provided, the function should create a new image with the new size and generate a buffer with the JPEG format. However, the current implementation doesnâ€™t produce the expected output, failing to create an image in the correct new size.
