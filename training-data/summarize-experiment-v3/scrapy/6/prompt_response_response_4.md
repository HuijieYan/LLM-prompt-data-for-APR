The potential error within the buggy function is the logic for converting images from RGBA to RGB as well as from other formats to RGB. The current implementation is not achieving the expected output based on the described test cases and their respective actual input/output variable values.

To fix the bug:
- When the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function should create a new RGBA background image and then convert it to RGB. This process is expected to be achieved by creating a new background image and then pasting the original image onto it.
- When the input image mode is not 'RGB', the function should convert it to 'RGB'. This should be addressed by implementing the correct logic for this conversion.
- When a size parameter is provided, the function should create a new image with the new size and generate a buffer with the JPEG format. This step should be revised to ensure the creation of the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- For the case where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', a new background is created and then the original image is pasted onto it, followed by the conversion to RGB using `convert` method.
- For images with modes other than 'RGB', the `convert` method is used to convert them to 'RGB'.
- When a size parameter is provided, the `thumbnail` method is used to create a new image with the new size.
- Finally, the image is saved with the JPEG format.

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and pass the failing test case.
