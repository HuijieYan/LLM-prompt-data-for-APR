## Bug Cause

The bug causes the function to not correctly handle the image mode and format, resulting in the incorrect output.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of RGB and palette mode images, leading to a discrepancy between the actual and expected output.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different image modes and formats, allowing for the proper conversion and resizing based on the input parameters.

The corrected code for the buggy function should address the discrepancies outlined in the failing test cases and ensure that the function produces the expected output.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code ensures that the image mode and format are handled correctly, allowing for the proper conversion and resizing based on the input parameters. It addresses the discrepancies outlined in the failing test cases and ensures that the function produces the expected output.
