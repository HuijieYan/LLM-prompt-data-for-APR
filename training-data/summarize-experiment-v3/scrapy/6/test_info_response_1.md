The failing test is `test_convert_image` in `tests/test_pipeline_images.py`. The error message presented is related to the `transparency case with palette: P and PNG` where it asserts that `converted.getcolors()` is not equal to `[(10000, (205, 230, 255))]`. This means that the failing test case is the one where the image is converted to a palette mode and then attempted to be converted.
