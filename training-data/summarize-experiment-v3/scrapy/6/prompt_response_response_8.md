The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conditional checks for the image format and mode. Based on the runtime analysis, it appears that the conversion to RGB mode is not happening as expected, leading to discrepancies between the actual and expected output.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks for image format and mode need to be revised to ensure that the appropriate conversions are applied when necessary. Additionally, the image resizing logic needs to be verified to ensure that the correct size is being applied.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. When creating the background image in the PNG RGBA case, the `paste` method now explicitly specifies the position of pasting the original image onto the background.
2. The conditional check for converting to RGB mode has been revised to ensure that images with modes other than 'RGB' are correctly converted.
3. The image resizing logic has been retained with the `thumbnail` method to preserve the size when a size parameter is provided.

By making these changes, the corrected code should ensure that the image format and mode conversions, as well as the resizing operations, are applied as intended, leading to the correct output for the `convert_image` function.
