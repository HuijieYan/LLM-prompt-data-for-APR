## Bug Location

The bug lies in the section of the code where the received_body is processed and transformed into values based on the required_params. Specifically, in the block where the value is assigned based on the received_body and the field alias.

## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of different sequence types while populating the 'values' variable. The function incorrectly converts the received body into a dict instead of a list, set, or tuple, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the handling of different sequence types should be adjusted, and the 'values' variable should be populated correctly based on the type of the required_params.


## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == sequence_shapes.LIST:  # Check if the shape is a list
                        # Convert the received body for the field alias into a list
                        value = [received_body.get(item) for item in received_body.keys() if item == field.alias]
                    elif field.shape == sequence_shapes.SET:  # Check if the shape is a set
                        # Convert the received body for the field alias into a set
                        value = {received_body.get(item) for item in received_body.keys() if item == field.alias}
                    elif field.shape == sequence_shapes.TUPLE:  # Check if the shape is a tuple
                        # Convert the received body for the field alias into a tuple
                        value = tuple(received_body.get(item) for item in received_body.keys() if item == field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```
In the corrected code, the part of the code that handles the transformation of the received_body into a list, set, or tuple has been adjusted. Based on the shape provided in the field, the received body is converted into the respective sequence type. This ensures that the 'values' variable is correctly populated based on the input sequence type.
