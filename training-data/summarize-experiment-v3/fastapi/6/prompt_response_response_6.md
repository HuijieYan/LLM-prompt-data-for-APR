## Identify a potential error location within the buggy function

The potential error in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely within the logic for parsing and validating sequence input types such as lists, sets, and tuples. This is indicated by the discrepancies between the observed and expected outputs in the failing tests, which specifically involve parsing form data into lists, sets, and tuples.


## Elucidate the bug's cause using:

(a) The buggy function: The function incorrectly handles the input values for sequence parameters, leading to incorrect parsing and validation.

(b) The failing test: The failing tests involve using form data to populate sequence parameters (lists, sets, and tuples) and assert the result.

(c) The corresponding error message: The assertion of the status code to be equal to 200 fails due to a difference of 422 and 200.

(d) The actual input/output variable values: The actual output values for the `values` variable do not match the expected values in the failing tests.

(e) The expected input/output variable values: The expected `values` variable is expected to be an empty dictionary in all cases, but the current implementation does not fulfill this expectation.

(f) The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue is related to supporting repeated key=value in form data, which could be impacting the parsing and validation of form data into lists, sets, and tuples.


## Suggest approaches for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by revisiting the logic for parsing and validation of sequence input types, ensuring that the function correctly handles repeated key=value pairs in form data and populates the values accordingly.


## Present the corrected code for the buggy function

The corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = tuple(value) if field.shape == 'tuple' else set(value)
        else:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                if field.shape == 'list':
                    values[field.name] = []
                elif field.shape == 'set':
                    values[field.name] = set()
                elif field.shape == 'tuple':
                    values[field.name] = ()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through the required parameters and correctly handles the parsing and validation of sequence input types. It distinguishes between lists, sets, and tuples and populates the values accordingly while also handling the presence of repeated key=value pairs in form data.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository and enable the function to pass the failing tests.
