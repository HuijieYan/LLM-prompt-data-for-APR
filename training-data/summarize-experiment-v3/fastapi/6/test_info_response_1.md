The failing tests of the `test_python_list_param_as_form()`, `test_python_set_param_as_form()`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form()` return the same error message, stating that the assertion of the status code to be equal to 200 fails due to a difference of 422 and 200. The relevant stack frame of the `request_body_to_args` function is suspected to lie in the logic responsible for parsing the request body and validating the incoming data. Therefore, the fault in the buggy function is likely linked to the parsing and validation of sequence input types such as lists, sets, and tuples.
