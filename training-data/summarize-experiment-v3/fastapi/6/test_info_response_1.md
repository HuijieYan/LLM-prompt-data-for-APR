The failing tests for functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are due to the buggy function `request_body_to_args` in `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` file. A common error message `assert 422 == 200` confirms that all three tests are failing at the `assert response.status_code == 200` line. It appears that the function is not handling the form data input for the parameters that needs the expected format for list, set, and tuple. The bug might be due to the incorrect handling of form data for these non-typing sequences.
