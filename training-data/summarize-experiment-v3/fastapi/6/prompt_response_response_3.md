## Bug Analysis

The bug is likely located in the section of the code that handles parsing and validating input values for sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is not correctly converting the received body into the expected sequence shape, leading to discrepancies between the current and expected outputs in all test cases.

The failing tests imply that the function is not correctly parsing or validating incoming data for the specified sequence types as form data. This is evident from the fact that the current output differs from the expected output, leading to assertion errors when comparing the status code to 200.

The GitHub issue further supports the hypothesis that the function is not correctly handling repeated key-value pairs in form data, as the described behavior aligns with the discrepancies observed in the failing test cases.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is likely related to a mismatch between the expected and actual parsing and validation of incoming data for sequence types (lists, sets, and tuples) as form data. Due to this discrepancy, the output of the function does not align with the expected output, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses and validates incoming data for sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples as form data. Additionally, it should handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation occurs, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

Ensuring that the function appropriately converts the received body into the expected sequence shape, handles repeated key-value pairs, and aligns with the expected output will resolve the discrepancies observed in the failing test cases.

## Corrected Code

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                # Handle repeated key=value pairs
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function has been adjusted to handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and correctly parse and validate incoming data for sequence shapes as form data. The adjustments aim to align the function's behavior with the expected output and resolve the discrepancies observed in the failing test cases.
