## Bug Fix

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles request data when received as FormData. Specifically, the issue seems to stem from incorrectly parsing and converting the received data into dictionary format, leading to unexpected results for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

To fix this bug, the function `request_body_to_args` should be updated to correctly handle the parsing and conversion of sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples from the received FormData.

The corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                    value = list(value)
                elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                    value = set(value)
                elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                    value = tuple(value)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code:
1. The loop for processing required parameters has been updated to correctly handle sequence shapes and their corresponding types.
2. The values for sequence shapes are now properly converted to list, set, or tuple based on the field type, eliminating the incorrectly converted dictionary issue.
3. The validation and error handling logic remains intact to ensure that correct values are validated and errors are appropriately captured.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the parsing and conversion of request body data, ensuring that sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples are processed as expected, and the function should pass the failing tests accordingly.
