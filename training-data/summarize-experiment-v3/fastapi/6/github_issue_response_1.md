The issue reported relates to FastAPI's inability to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. The `request_body_to_args` function currently does not collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives, and hence assigns only the last value to the key before validation happens. This behavior is contradictory to the expected functionality, where the repeated keys should be collected and assigned as a list to the same key before validation. The issue seems to stem from the handling of form data and the validation process within the function.
