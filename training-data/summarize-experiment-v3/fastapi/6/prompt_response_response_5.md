## Bug Cause
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is caused by the incorrect conversion of the received body into a dictionary when dealing with sequence types such as list, set, and tuple. This results in the incorrect processing and validation of the incoming data, leading to the generation of errors and incorrect output values.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the processing of sequence input types and ensure that the received body is appropriately converted into the expected sequence type.

## The corrected code
```python

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if field.type_ == list:
                values[field.name] = value
            elif field.type_ == set:
                values[field.name] = set(value)
            elif field.type_ == tuple:
                values[field.name] = tuple(value)
                
    return values, errors

```
By correcting the section of the code that handles the conversion of the received body into sequence types and updating the assignment of the 'values' variable based on the type of the field, the corrected code ensures that the function processes the incoming data correctly and generates the expected output values.
