## Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be causing the issue with parsing and validating sequence input types such as lists, sets, and tuples. It fails to correctly handle the scenario where the request body contains repeated keys with the same name, leading to unexpected results.

The function incorrectly converts the received body into a dict for the cases of list, set, and tuple input types, instead of populating the 'values' variable with the expected types of sequence (list, set, tuple).

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles the conversion of the received body into the expected types of sequence (list, set, tuple). Additionally, the function should populate the 'values' variable with the correct type of sequence and handle the scenario where the request body contains repeated keys with the same name.

## Updated Buggy Function
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:  
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                    else:
                        values[field.alias] = field.default if field.default is not None else []
                    continue
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if field.type_ in {list, set}:
                        values[field.alias] = value
                    elif field.type_ == tuple:
                        values[field.alias] = tuple(value)
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.alias] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the updated function, we've made the following changes:
- Removed unnecessary checks and assignments from the function logic to reduce complexity and streamline the code.
- Added proper handling for the scenario where the request body contains repeated keys with the same name for list, set, and tuple input types.
- Correctly populated the 'values' variable with the expected types of sequence (list, set, tuple) based on the received body.

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle the parsing and validation of sequence input types correctly and align with the expected behavior.
