In all the expected cases, the function is expected to populate the 'values' and 'errors' variables based on the received parameters and body. However, in all cases, the 'values' variable is expected to be an empty dictionary, but the current implementation does not seem to fulfill this expectation. Additionally, the expected list of errors and the errors generated by the function do not match in any of the cases, indicating a discrepancy between the current and expected outputs. These differences suggest that the function is not working as intended and may contain a bug.
