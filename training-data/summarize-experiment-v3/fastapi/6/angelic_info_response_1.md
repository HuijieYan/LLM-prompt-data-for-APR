The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not returning the expected values and types of variables, based on the provided cases. In each case, there are discrepancies between the expected and the actual outputs of the function. For example, in case 1, the expected value for `values` is an empty dictionary, but the function is returning non-empty values. Similar discrepancies exist in other cases as well. The function should be reviewed to address the issues and reconcile the differences between the expected and actual outputs.
