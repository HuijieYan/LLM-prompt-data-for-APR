# Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `initialize` function not handling the case properly when `make_current` is True. It is currently checking if the current IOLoop instance is None, but if make_current is True, it should be checking if the current IOLoop instance exists.

# Approach for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional check to consider the make_current parameter when determining whether to raise a RuntimeError. Additionally, the logic for setting the current instance may also need to be adjusted to handle the make_current parameter appropriately.

# Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function now properly checks the value of `make_current` and the current IOLoop instance to determine whether to set the current instance or raise a RuntimeError.
