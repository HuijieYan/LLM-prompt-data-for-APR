## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the initialize method in the IOLoop class. When make_current is set to True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, it improperly raises a RuntimeError even though it should not because the current IOLoop doesn't already exist.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the initialize method to only raise a RuntimeError if make_current is True and the current IOLoop already exists. Additionally, the condition for raising a RuntimeError should be inverted.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
