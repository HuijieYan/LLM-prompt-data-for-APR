## Bug Cause

The bug's cause appears to be the inconsistency in the condition check for the current IOLoop instance. The initialize function checks for the current IOLoop instance and makes it the current one if make_current is None or True. However, when make_current is True and a current IOLoop instance already exists, it erroneously raises a RuntimeError.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

One approach for fixing the bug is to update the condition checking logic in the initialize function. It should only raise a RuntimeError when make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. If make_current is None, it should proceed to make the IOLoop instance the current one. Additionally, the check for the current instance can be simplified to avoid potential edge cases.

## The corrected code

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
