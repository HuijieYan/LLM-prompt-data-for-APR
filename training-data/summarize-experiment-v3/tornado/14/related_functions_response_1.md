Class IOLoop docstring: This class represents a level-triggered I/O loop. It mentions using "epoll" (Linux) or "kqueue" (BSD and Mac OS X) if available, or falling back on select(). It also includes an example usage for a simple TCP server.

`IOLoop.current(instance=True)`: This function, called in the `initialize` method, likely retrieves the current instance of the IOLoop class. It has a parameter `instance`, which is presumably used to control the behavior of obtaining the current instance.

`make_current(self)`: This function, called in the `initialize` method, likely sets the current instance of the IOLoop class.

`def initialize(self, make_current=None)`: This is the buggy function that needs attention. It takes an optional `make_current` argument and conditionally sets the current instance based on its value and the condition whether the current instance is already set.
