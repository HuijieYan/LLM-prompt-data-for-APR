## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the initialize method of the IOLoop class. When the parameter make_current is True, the current instance of IOLoop is checked and if it already exists, a RuntimeError is raised, which is contradictory.

## Approach to Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the initialize method to correctly handle the make_current parameter and the current instance of IOLoop.

## The Corrected Code

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected code, the logic is adjusted to first assign the current instance to a variable and then check it. This should eliminate the contradictory behavior and fix the bug.
