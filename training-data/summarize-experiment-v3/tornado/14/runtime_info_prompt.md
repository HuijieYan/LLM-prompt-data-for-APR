Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing runtime information of a buggy program. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with the values it produces. These values include the input parameters (with their values and types) and the output values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Your role is not to fix or explain the bug but to print intput and output values and types that are relevant to the bug.

# One-shot example:

Given the source code and runtime information of a function, here's how you might summarize it:

## Example Source Code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        result = 0
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)
    return result
```

## Example Runtime Information:

### Case 1
- Input parameters: n (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 0, type: int)

### Case 2
- Input parameters: n (value: 3, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 6, type: int)


## Example Summary:

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: n (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 0, type: int)
Rational: for this input, the function computes the factorial of 0, which should be 1, and not 0.

## The source code of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

# Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
make_current, value: `True`, type: `bool`

# Summary:

[Your summary here. You need to only copy runtime input/output values that are likely relevant to the bug, and provide a concise rational for your choice.]
