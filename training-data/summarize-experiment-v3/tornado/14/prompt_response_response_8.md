## Bug's Cause

The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True, even if the current IOLoop instance is not already set.


## Fixing the Bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is already set.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this change, the `initialize` method checks for the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and proceeds accordingly, ensuring that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly.


This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the failing test case `test_force_current` passes successfully.
