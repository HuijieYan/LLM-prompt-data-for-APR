Based on the analysis, the bug within the table_exists function arises from its case-sensitive comparison of table names, leading to inconsistent results when checking for table existence. The bug is exemplified in the failing test cases, and has been recognized in GitHub issues #896 and the associated pull request.

To resolve this issue, the function needs to be updated to handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional check to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected code for the table_exists function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
With this correction, the table_exists function now performs case-insensitive checks when verifying the existence of tables in the database, addressing the issue mentioned in GitHub and ensuring consistent functionality across different table name cases.
