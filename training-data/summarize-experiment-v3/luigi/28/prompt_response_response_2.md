The potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of the table name with the stdout. The bug's cause is related to case sensitivity in matching and comparing table names, leading to inconsistent results when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, the table name and stdout comparison should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function, making the table_exists function case insensitive:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the program should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of the table_exists function should be resolved.
