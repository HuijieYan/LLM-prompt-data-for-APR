Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the buggy function is the comparison of table names, resulting in case sensitivity issues.

The bug's cause:
(a) The `table_exists` function currently returns True or False based on the presence of a table, which does not align with the expected output values.
(b) The `HiveCommandClient` class uses `hive` invocations to find information and is likely causing the issues with case sensitivity.
(c) The `run_hive_cmd` function is called within the `table_exists` function to execute a Hive command and return the standard output.
(d) The failing test cases are causing an AssertionError due to the value not returning as expected.
(e) The issue is due to case insensitivity, leading to the failure of the `table_exists` function.
(f) The actual input/output variable values indicate inconsistencies due to case sensitivity.
(g) The expected input/output variable values are not matching with the actual outputs, leading to the failures.
(h) The GitHub issue #896 relates to the case sensitivity problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence.
2. Implement the proposed fix from GitHub issue #896, which suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function to resolve the case sensitivity bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By incorporating the proposed fix of case-insensitive comparisons using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the `table_exists` function is now capable of handling case sensitivity issues and will pass the failing test cases.
