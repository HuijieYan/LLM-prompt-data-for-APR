The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive. When checking for an existing table, the function does not account for the fact that hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase. This results in failures when checking for tables with capitalized names. The issue description suggests checking stdout against `table.lower()` to avoid case issues. This oversight in the function's implementation causes it to fail when dealing with tables that are defined with capitalized names, and the proposed fix would address this problem.
