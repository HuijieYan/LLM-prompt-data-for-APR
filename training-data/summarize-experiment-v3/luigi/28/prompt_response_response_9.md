The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is likely in the comparison of table names, where case sensitivity may lead to inconsistent results. This issue has been identified as a problem with the case sensitivity of table names in the function. 

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the tables returned from the Hive command. This will ensure that the function behaves consistently regardless of the case of the table names. 

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the comparison between the provided table name and the tables returned from the Hive command has been modified to be case-insensitive by converting both table names to lowercase before comparing them. This change ensures that the function will consistently check for table existence without being affected by the case sensitivity of the table names.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This fix also addresses the issue posted in GitHub regarding the case insensitivity of table existence checks.
