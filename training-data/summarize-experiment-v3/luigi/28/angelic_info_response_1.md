In the buggy function table_exists, there are discrepancies in the expected outputs for the given test cases. In cases 1 and 3, the expected value of stdout is 'OK', but the function is currently returning True or False based on the presence of a table, indicating that the function is not working properly. Additionally, in cases 2 and 4, the expected values of stdout are 'OK\nmytable', but the function is currently returning True or False based on the presence of partitions, which also indicates an issue.
