The `table_exists` function is supposed to check for the existence of a table in a database and return a boolean value based on the result. However, in the failing test cases, the function is not returning the expected values. In Case 1, the expected value of `stdout` is 'OK', but the function is not returning this value. Similarly, in Case 2, the expected value of `stdout` is 'OK\nmytable', but the function is not returning this value. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working properly and needs to be fixed.
