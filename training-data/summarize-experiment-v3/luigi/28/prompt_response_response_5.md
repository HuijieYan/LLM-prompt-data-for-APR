The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing it to be case-sensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the database. This is resulting in inconsistencies and errors when comparing table names. The issue has been reported on GitHub and is related to problem #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned in `stdout` to ensure case insensitivity.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will satisfy the expected input/output variable information, pass the failing test cases, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
