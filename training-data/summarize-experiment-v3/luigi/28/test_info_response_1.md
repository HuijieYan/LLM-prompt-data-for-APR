Based on the failing test cases and the error messages, the issue is likely within the table_exists function of the luigi.contrib.hive module. Specifically, the failing assertion of table_exists in both test cases cause an AssertionError due to the value not returning as expected. The problem seems to be due to case insensitivity, as evidenced by the issue #896 test case insensitivity check. This inconsistency leads to the failure of the table_exists function. Therefore, this function should be examined for potential issues when dealing with matching and comparing table names.
