Based on the provided information and the analysis of the bug, the potential error in the `table_exists` function is related to the case sensitivity of table names. The current function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons, leading to inconsistencies in the return values. This issue has been identified and reported as GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to perform case insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of tables in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() == 'ok'
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will perform case insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of tables, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
