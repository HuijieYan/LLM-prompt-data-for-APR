## Bug Cause

The bug in the `table_exists` function appears to be related to case sensitivity when comparing table names. This inconsistency leads to the failure of the function, as it does not handle case insensitivity with table names as required.

## Approach to Fix

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive for table names, the comparison between the table name and the standard output should be done after converting both to lowercase. This approach ensures that the comparison is not impacted by case differences between the table name and the returned table names.

## Corrected Code

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Using bool() function directly instead of conditional check
```

In the corrected code, the case insensitivity issue is addressed by converting both the table name and the returned table names to lowercase before comparing them. Additionally, the conditional return statements are simplified using the `bool()` function.
