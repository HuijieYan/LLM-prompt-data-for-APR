# Bug's Cause
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The `self.columns` variable is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

# Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

# Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.
