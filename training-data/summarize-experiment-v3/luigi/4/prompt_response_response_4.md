## Bug's Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not correctly handling the case when `self.columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to determine the length of `self.columns`. This bug prevents the function from executing correctly when columns are not provided.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `copy` function should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to determine its length. If `self.columns` is not None, the function should proceed to construct the `colnames` string as before.

## The Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the function only attempts to construct the `colnames` string when `self.columns` is not None. This will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to execute correctly even when columns are not provided.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function executes as expected.
