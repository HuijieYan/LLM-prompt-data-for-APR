The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `redshift_test.py` fails at line 337 with a `TypeError` at line 356 of `redshift.py` upon the `self.copy` call. The error occurs when checking the length of `self.columns` while inserting a file. The failing test mocks the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object's `columns` attribute as `None`, and the bug in the `copy` function of `redshift.py` is triggered when the `len()` function is applied to `self.columns` when it's `None`.
