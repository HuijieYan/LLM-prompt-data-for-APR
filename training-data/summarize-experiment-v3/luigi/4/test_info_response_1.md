The failing test case is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`. The run method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is called. Within this method, the `copy` function of `S3CopyToTable` is called with a cursor and a file path as parameters. Inside the `copy` function, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because the `self.columns` is `None`. This error is raised at line 356 of redshift.py.
