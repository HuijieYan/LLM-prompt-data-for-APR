In the buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, the issue arises when running Redshift COPY jobs with no columns using luigi 2.7.1, resulting in a TypeError. The bug is linked to https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338, specifically the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The proposed solution is to change it to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the issue. This suggests that the behavior of the function relies heavily on the presence and type of columns being provided, leading to the faulty behavior described in the issue.
