Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing a GitHub issue to identify a bug in a program. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with associated GitHub issue. Your role is not to fix the bug but to summarize how the function implementation contributes to the faulty behaviour described in the issue. You summary needs to be a single paragraph; it must refer to concrete details from the issue description.

# The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
    
```

# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
The root cause seems to be https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338

A possible solution would be to change the line to

if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
unless I am missing some reason to explicitly ask only for len(self.columns).
```
