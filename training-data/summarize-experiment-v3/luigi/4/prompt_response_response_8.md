## Bug Analysis

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine its length. This issue was reported on GitHub with a proposed solution to change the conditional check in the `copy` function.

The bug's cause appears to be the mishandling of the `self.columns` attribute, which is expected to hold the column names for the table, but when it is `None`, the function fails to handle this case properly.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `self.columns` should be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line should be changed to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that an attempt to access the length of `self.columns` is only made when it is not `None`.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected `copy` function with the modified conditional check:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves as expected.
