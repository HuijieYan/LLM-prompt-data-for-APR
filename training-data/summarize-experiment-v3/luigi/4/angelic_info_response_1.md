In the provided buggy function, the 'copy' method in the redshift.py file, there is an issue with the 'colnames' variable. The 'colnames' variable should be populated with the column names separated by commas if there are more than 0 columns, and enclosed in parenthesis. However, there is a discrepancy in the current implementation, which does not accurately generate the 'colnames' if the 'self.columns' list is not empty. Therefore, the function is not properly handling the inclusion of column names when creating the SQL command for the 'COPY' operation.
