## Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is None, this line raises a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The root cause of this issue is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
One potential solution could be to modify the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This modification checks for both the presence of `self.columns` and its length, avoiding the `NoneType` error.

## Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length, thus preventing the `NoneType` error mentioned in the GitHub issue.
