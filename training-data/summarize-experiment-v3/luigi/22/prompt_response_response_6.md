The potential error in the buggy function is with the `last_active` parameter not being properly initialized.

The bug is caused by the `last_active=None` parameter in the `__init__` function, which results in `last_active` being assigned the value of `None`. This causes issues when the `prune` method tries to perform addition with `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

To fix the bug:
1. Properly initialize the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function to avoid potential `None` values.
2. Handle the `last_active` parameter properly in the `__init__` function to ensure its correct initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value for `last_active` using `time.time()`, we ensure that the attribute is properly initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch when the default value is used. This avoids potential `None` values and ensures that the `prune` method can perform operations involving `self.last_active` without encountering a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.
