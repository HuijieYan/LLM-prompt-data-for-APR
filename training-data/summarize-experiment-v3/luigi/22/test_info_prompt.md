Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing a stack trace of a failing test to identify a bug in a program. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with the code of the failing tests and the full error messages. Your role is not to fix the bug but to summarize what what stack frames or messages are closely related to the fault location in the buggy function, and simplify the original error message. You summary should be in a single paragraph.

## The source code of the buggy function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

# Test case 1 for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: test/scheduler_test.py

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

## The error message from the failing test
```text
self = <scheduler_test.SchedulerTest testMethod=test_worker_prune_after_init>

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)
    
        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10
    
>       worker.prune(TmpCfg())
