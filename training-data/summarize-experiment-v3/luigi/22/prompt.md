Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```


Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:

The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` is generating a `TypeError` at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` class instance with a `config` parameter. The specific problem is due to the unsupported addition operation between `NoneType` and `int`, suggesting that the `self.last_active` attribute is `None`. This stack trace indicates that the issue originates from the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which takes `worker_id` and an optional `last_active` parameter, used to set the `last_active` attribute. Thus, the bug is likely to be in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter needs to be handled correctly when it is not provided.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- worker_id (value: 123, type: int)
- last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)

Rational: The values of worker_id and last_active seem to be correctly assigned and passed as input parameters, and their types are as expected. The issue does not seem to be with the input parameters.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the failing test execution, the expected values and types of the relevant variables at the function's return differ from the actual output. The expected value of self.id is 123, indicating an integer type, while the type and value of last_active are not specified in the expected output. Similarly, the expected value and type of self.started, self.tasks, and self.info are different from the actual values yielded by the buggy function. Therefore, the discrepancy between the expect and actual outputs suggests that the function is not working properly and requires correction.


## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Based on the GitHub issue, the bug in the `__init__` function of the `scheduler.py` file seems to be related to the `last_active` parameter. The issue description mentions that when a worker is inactive for a long time, it still appears as active. This indicates that the initialization of the `last_active` variable may not be updating correctly, leading to incorrect status reporting for the worker. It is possible that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly updated with the current timestamp, causing the worker to incorrectly appear as active even when it is not.
