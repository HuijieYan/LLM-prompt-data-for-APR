## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import time
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class is a structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The related functions or attributes `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` likely play a role in maintaining and tracking worker activity.

`def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)`: This function is the constructor for the `Worker` class which takes in the `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters, initializes the `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` attributes. The `last_active` parameter seems to be optional as indicated by the `None` default value.

`self.started = time.time()`: This line of code sets the `started` attribute to the current time in seconds since epoch.

`self.tasks = set()`: This line of code initializes the `tasks` attribute as an empty set, presumably to store task objects.

`self.info = {}`: This line of code initializes the `info` attribute as an empty dictionary.

The function seems to be setting up the initial state of a worker by initializing its attributes.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` from `scheduler_test.py` tried to invoke the `prune` method of the `Worker` class with a custom configuration (`TmpCfg`) containing a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute. The failing statement inside the `prune` method is performing addition with `self.last_active` (which is initialized as `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types. The source of the bug is likely related to the handling of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, which is not properly initialized.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: worker_id (value: 123, type: int), last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)
- Output: self.started (value: 1706548223.6552343, type: float)
Rational: The discrepancy between the last_active value provided and the self.started value suggests a potential issue with the calculation or initialization of the self.started variable.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In this case, the expected output of the function for worker_id = 123 should have self.id = 123, self.started = 1706548222.8972173, self.tasks = set(), and self.info = {}. However, based on the given source code, it seems that the last_active parameter is not being handled, which could lead to discrepancies in the expected output for certain test cases. Additionally, the reference attribute is not being assigned, which might also lead to discrepancies in the expected output for certain cases. This indicates that the function is not working properly for all scenarios.
