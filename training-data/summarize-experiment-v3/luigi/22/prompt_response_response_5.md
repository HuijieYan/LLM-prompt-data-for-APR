The potential bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly handled, leading to discrepancies in the `self.started` attribute. Additionally, the `reference` attribute is not being assigned, which might also result in discrepancies in the expected output for certain cases.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to properly handle the `last_active` parameter, either by setting it to the provided value or to the current time if it is `None`.
2. We also need to properly assign the `reference` attribute to ensure its correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = {}  # Initialize as an empty dictionary
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # set to the provided value
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set to the current time in seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With these changes, the `last_active` parameter will be properly handled, and the `reference` attribute will be initialized as an empty dictionary. This should ensure that the `__init__` function works properly for all scenarios.
