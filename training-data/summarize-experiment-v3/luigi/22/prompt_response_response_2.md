## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter not being properly initialized in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This leads to discrepancies in the expected output for certain test cases that depend on the `last_active` attribute of the worker.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be properly handled and initialized in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized using the `time.time()` function only if it is `None`, otherwise, it is initialized with the provided `last_active` value. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always properly initialized, resolving the bug. Now, the program should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
