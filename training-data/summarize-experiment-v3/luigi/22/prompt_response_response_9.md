## Bug's Cause
The bug's cause is likely related to the mishandling of the `last_active` parameter within the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. In the provided function, the `last_active` parameter is simply assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute without any conditional check, resulting in potential issues when performing operations involving the `last_active`.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly handled within the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This may involve adding a conditional check to handle cases where `last_active` is not provided or ensuring that the `last_active` is properly initialized if it is not None.

## Corrected Code
Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional check to handle the `last_active` parameter. If `last_active` is not None, it is assigned to `self.last_active`. Otherwise, the `self.last_active` is initialized using the current time.

By making this change, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly handled and initialized, thereby addressing the potential bug in the original function.
