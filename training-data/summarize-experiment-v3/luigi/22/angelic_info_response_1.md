In this case, the expected output of the function for worker_id = 123 should have self.id = 123, self.started = 1706548222.8972173, self.tasks = set(), and self.info = {}. However, based on the given source code, it seems that the last_active parameter is not being handled, which could lead to discrepancies in the expected output for certain test cases. Additionally, the reference attribute is not being assigned, which might also lead to discrepancies in the expected output for certain cases. This indicates that the function is not working properly for all scenarios.
