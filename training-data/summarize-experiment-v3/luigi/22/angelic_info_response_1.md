In the failing test execution, the expected values and types of the relevant variables at the function's return differ from the actual output. The expected value of self.id is 123, indicating an integer type, while the type and value of last_active are not specified in the expected output. Similarly, the expected value and type of self.started, self.tasks, and self.info are different from the actual values yielded by the buggy function. Therefore, the discrepancy between the expect and actual outputs suggests that the function is not working properly and requires correction.
