## Bug's Cause

The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class due to the mishandling of the `last_active` parameter, which if not provided, defaults to `None`. This results in the `last_active` attribute being set to `None`, leading to issues when it's used in subsequent calculations when not properly handled.


## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method needs to handle the `last_active` parameter properly, such that it initializes the `last_active` attribute with the provided value if it's not `None` or else initializes it with the current time.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This code checks if `last_active` is not `None` before assigning it, else it initializes `last_active` with the current time.


By implementing this fix, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class handles the `last_active` parameter appropriately, ensuring that the `last_active` attribute is initialized correctly based on the provided input. This updated code should resolve the bug and ensure the proper initialization and handling of the `last_active` attribute.
