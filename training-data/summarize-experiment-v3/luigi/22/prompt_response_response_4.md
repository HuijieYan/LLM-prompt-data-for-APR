## Bug Cause Analysis:

The bug seems to be caused by the `last_active` parameter not being properly handled in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is being used to initialize the `self.last_active` attribute, but in the case where `last_active` is provided as `None`, it is not being properly handled, leading to potential issues when used in subsequent calculations or comparisons.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly handled, even when it is provided as `None`. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check in the `__init__` function to handle the case when `last_active` is provided as `None`. Additionally, we should ensure that the `reference` attribute is properly initialized, as it is currently set to `None` and may cause discrepancies in certain scenarios.

## The corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = {}  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With the provided correction, the initialization of the `last_active` attribute will properly handle the case when `last_active` is provided as `None`. Additionally, the `reference` attribute has been initialized as an empty dictionary to ensure it is properly handled.

This corrected code should now address the issues associated with the original bug and ensure the expected output for the `__init__` function.
