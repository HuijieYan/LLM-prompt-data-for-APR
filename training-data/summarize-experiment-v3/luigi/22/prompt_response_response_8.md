The potential error location is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, and it is not being used to initialize the `last_active` attribute, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `last_active` parameter and initialize the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `last_active` in the `__init__` method. If `last_active` is not None, it is used to initialize the `last_active` attribute. Otherwise, the current time in seconds since epoch is used to initialize the `last_active` attribute. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized based on the input parameter.

With this correction, the program should pass the failing test, and the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
