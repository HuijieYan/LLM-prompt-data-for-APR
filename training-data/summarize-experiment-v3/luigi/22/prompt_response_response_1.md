The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized and handled in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This leads to discrepancies in the expected output and can cause errors when the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is called.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class and ensure that it is initialized correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, we use the `time.time()` function to initialize the `last_active` parameter if it is not provided, ensuring its proper initialization.

This fix should ensure that the `last_active` parameter is handled correctly, and the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class works as expected for all scenarios.
