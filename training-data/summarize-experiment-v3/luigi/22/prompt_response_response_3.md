## Bug's Cause

The bug may be caused by the `last_active` attribute not being properly initialized, which can result in discrepancies when using it in calculations or comparisons with other variables.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function needs to properly handle the `last_active` parameter for both cases when it is provided and when it is not.

## The Corrected Code

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
