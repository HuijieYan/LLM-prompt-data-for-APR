The relevant input/output values are
- worker_id (value: 123, type: int)
- last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)

Rational: The values of worker_id and last_active seem to be correctly assigned and passed as input parameters, and their types are as expected. The issue does not seem to be with the input parameters.
