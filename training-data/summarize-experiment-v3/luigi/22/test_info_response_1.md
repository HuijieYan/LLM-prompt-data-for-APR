The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` is generating a `TypeError` at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` class instance with a `config` parameter. The specific problem is due to the unsupported addition operation between `NoneType` and `int`, suggesting that the `self.last_active` attribute is `None`. This stack trace indicates that the issue originates from the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which takes `worker_id` and an optional `last_active` parameter, used to set the `last_active` attribute. Thus, the bug is likely to be in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter needs to be handled correctly when it is not provided.
