The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` from `scheduler_test.py` tried to invoke the `prune` method of the `Worker` class with a custom configuration (`TmpCfg`) containing a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute. The failing statement inside the `prune` method is performing addition with `self.last_active` (which is initialized as `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types. The source of the bug is likely related to the handling of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, which is not properly initialized.
