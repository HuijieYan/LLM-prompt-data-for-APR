Class docstring: This class is a structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The related functions or attributes `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` likely play a role in maintaining and tracking worker activity.

`def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)`: This function is the constructor for the `Worker` class which takes in the `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters, initializes the `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` attributes. The `last_active` parameter seems to be optional as indicated by the `None` default value.

`self.started = time.time()`: This line of code sets the `started` attribute to the current time in seconds since epoch.

`self.tasks = set()`: This line of code initializes the `tasks` attribute as an empty set, presumably to store task objects.

`self.info = {}`: This line of code initializes the `info` attribute as an empty dictionary.

The function seems to be setting up the initial state of a worker by initializing its attributes.
