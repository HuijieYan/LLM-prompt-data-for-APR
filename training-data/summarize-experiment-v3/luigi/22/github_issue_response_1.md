Based on the GitHub issue, the bug in the `__init__` function of the `scheduler.py` file seems to be related to the `last_active` parameter. The issue description mentions that when a worker is inactive for a long time, it still appears as active. This indicates that the initialization of the `last_active` variable may not be updating correctly, leading to incorrect status reporting for the worker. It is possible that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly updated with the current timestamp, causing the worker to incorrectly appear as active even when it is not.
