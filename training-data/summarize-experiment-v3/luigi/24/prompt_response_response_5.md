Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The function should iterate through the input dictionary and preserve the key-value pairs with correct formatting.
2. The function should correctly construct the command list with the preserved key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly iterates through the input dictionary, preserving the key-value pairs and correctly formatting the command list. This should address the issues identified and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
