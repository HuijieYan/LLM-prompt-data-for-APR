## Bug Causes

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is failing to handle the input dictionary properly, resulting in incorrect formatting of the `command` list. The main issue appears to be in the processing of the `value` parameter when it is a dictionary, leading to mismatches in key-value pairs and incorrect command composition based on the input dictionary. This is evident from the failing test case and the expected vs. actual output values.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, the handling of the input dictionary needs to be revised. Specifically, when iterating through the key-value pairs of the dictionary, the function should ensure that the keys and values are formatted correctly and appended to the `command` list in a way that meets the expected output.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the corrected code, the function should properly handle the input dictionary, preserving the case of the keys and values, and correctly formatting the output `command` list. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test case, ensuring that the function produces the expected output.
