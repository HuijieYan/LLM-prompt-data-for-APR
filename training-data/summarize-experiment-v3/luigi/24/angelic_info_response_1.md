In case 1, the function should return `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, `Value`, and `Prop` as the command list, value, and prop variables respectively, but instead, it returns `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, `val1`, and `prop1`. These discrepancies indicate that the function is not working properly, as it should correctly construct the command list using the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. In case 2, similar issues arise, further confirming the bug's existence.
