In the first case, the expected output of the command variable is `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, but the actual value produced is `['--conf', '"prop=Value"']`, where the capitalization of the key 'Prop' is not preserved. Additionally, the expected value of the 'value' variable is `'Value'`, while the actual value is `'val'`, and the expected value of 'prop' is 'Prop', but the actual value is 'prop'. In the second case, the expected output of the command variable is `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, but the actual value produced is `['--conf', '"prop=val1"']`, where the key 'prop1' is not preserved. Furthermore, the expected value of the 'value' variable is `'val1'`, while the actual value is `'val'`, and the expected value of 'prop' is 'prop1', but the actual value is 'prop'. Both cases highlight that the function is not working properly and does not handle the input dictionary correctly.
