## The bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the `_dict_arg` function not properly handling the input dictionary. It does not preserve the capitalization of keys and incorrectly formats the command output.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name within the `for` loop to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter.
2. Add logic to properly maintain the capitalization of keys and values within the input dictionary.
3. Ensure that the command list is constructed correctly based on the input dictionary.

## Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```
