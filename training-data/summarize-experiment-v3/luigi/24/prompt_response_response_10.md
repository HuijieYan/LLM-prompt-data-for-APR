The potential error in the buggy function lies within the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
It seems to incorrectly format the command list by not properly placing the key-value pair within the double quotes.

The bug's cause is likely due to how the `value` parameter is handled and how it constructs the `command` list. The function should handle the input dictionary correctly and show the preserved keys and values, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the command list is constructed and ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the variable name "value" to "val" within the loop and adjusting the way the key-value pair is added to the `command` list, the bug should be fixed. This change ensures that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted within the double quotes and preserves the capitalization of the keys in the command list.
