In the provided code, function _dict_arg() in luigi/contrib/spark.py contains a bug. In TestSparkSubmitTask class within contrb/spark_test.py:149, the function returns an AssertionError due to a mismatch in the proc variable. Similarly, another AssertionError occurs in TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask class within contrib/spark_test.py:165 because of a mismatch in proc variable. The stack trace suggests the mismatch is related to the "--conf" command of the function. The failing tests indicate that the mismatch arises from the properties file configuration.
