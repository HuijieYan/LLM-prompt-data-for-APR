Class docstring: The `SparkSubmitTask` class is a template for running a Spark job and supports running jobs on various Spark environments.

`def name(self)`: This function is from the same file but is not the same class, and is likely unrelated to the buggy function.

`def _dict_arg(self, name, value)`: This is the buggy function that needs attention. It seems to be taking a `name` and `value` as parameters and is supposed to construct a command based on the values provided. The issue likely lies in how it handles the `value` parameter, particularly with the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict)`, and how it constructs the `command` list.

By analyzing the related functions and class, it can help developers understand how the problematic function fits within the larger codebase and identify potential interactions that may be causing it to fail.
