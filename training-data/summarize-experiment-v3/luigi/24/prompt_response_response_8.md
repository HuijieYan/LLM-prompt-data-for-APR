## Bug in the Function

The potential bug in the function `_dict_arg` lies in how it handles the input dictionary `value` and constructs the `command` list. It appears that the function is not correctly preserving the capitalization of keys in the input dictionary and is also producing incorrect output for the `value` and `prop` variables.

The cause of these issues can be attributed to the implementation of the for loop that iterates over the items in the input dictionary and constructs the `command` list. This could be due to an incorrect string formatting or an oversight in how the key-value pairs are processed.

To fix the bug, the for loop should be modified to correctly preserve the capitalization of the keys and format the key-value pairs in the `command` list.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Ensure that the capitalization of keys in the input dictionary is preserved during the construction of the `command` list.
2. Properly format the key-value pairs in the `command` list to ensure that they match the expected output.

Revising the for loop and the formatting of the `command` list based on the input dictionary items should address the issues identified.


## The Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected code, the variable `value` is replaced with `val` within the for loop to avoid confusion with the function parameter. This change ensures that the correct value is used for formatting the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

With this correction, the function should now handle the input dictionary correctly and produce the expected output for the `command` list, `value`, and `prop` variables.
