Approaches to fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic to ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list.
2. Make sure to maintain the capitalization of the keys in the dictionary.
3. Ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly extracted from the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected code:
1. Changed the variable `value` to `val` inside the for loop to avoid conflicts with the input variable.
2. Updated the string formatting to use `prop` and `val` instead of `prop` and `value`.
3. Ensured that the capitalization of the keys in the dictionary is preserved.
4. Checked that the function correctly extracts the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected, allowing it to pass the failing test case.
