The bug in the function `_dict_arg` seems to lie in how it handles the input dictionary. It fails to preserve capitalization of keys and properly construct the command list. This leads to unexpected output and causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised code should address the issue by correctly handling the input dictionary and preserving the key-value pairs in the constructed command list.
