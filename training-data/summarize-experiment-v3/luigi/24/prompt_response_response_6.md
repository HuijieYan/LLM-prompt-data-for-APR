## Bug's Causes

The bug's cause stems from the function `_dict_arg` not correctly handling the input dictionary, resulting in the command list's incorrect formatting. The keys are not preserved as expected, and the corresponding values are also mismatched.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the input dictionary and preserve the key-value pairs while properly formatting the command list.


## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from `value` to `val` to avoid confusion with the outer `value`
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Update the formatting to preserve the key-value pairs
    return command
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the input dictionary correctly and properly format the command list. The preserved key-value pairs should match the expected output, resolving the bug.
