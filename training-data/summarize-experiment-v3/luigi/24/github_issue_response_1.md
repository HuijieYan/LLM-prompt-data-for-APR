The GitHub issue describes a problem with the `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. The issue reports that the function is not correctly constructing the command when the `value` parameter is a dictionary, resulting in unexpected behavior. Upon further analysis, it appears that the function iterates through the input dictionary and constructs the command by appending a list of name-value pairs to the `command` list. However, there is a bug in the construction of the command list, as the string representation of each name-value pair is not properly formatted, possibly leading to incorrect command generation and the reported faulty behavior.
