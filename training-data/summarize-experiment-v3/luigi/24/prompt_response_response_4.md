## Correction of the Bug

The bug seems to stem from how the function constructs the `command` list and deals with the input dictionary. The issue points to the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict)` and the subsequent loop for constructing the `command` list.

### Approach for fixing the bug:

1. We need to ensure that the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict)` is correctly handling the input dictionary.
2. Within the loop, the construction of the `command` list needs to correctly format the key-value pairs.
3. The case sensitivity issue in preserving the key and the value also needs to be addressed.
4. The corrected function should ensure that the `command` list is constructed properly and outputs the expected format.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary. It ensures that the key-value pairs are properly formatted and that the case of the keys is preserved. This corrected function should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.
