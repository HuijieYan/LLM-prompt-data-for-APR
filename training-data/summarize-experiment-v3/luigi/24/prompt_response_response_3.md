The buggy function `_dict_arg` has been corrected and incorporated into the entire class. The corrected `_dict_arg` function now properly constructs the command list by formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. The correction addresses the reported discrepancies and the observed faulty behavior in the test cases. The corrected version is now available for use as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
