Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a separate variable for the key when iterating through the input dictionary to avoid overwriting the original variable.
2. Ensure that the key in the command list is properly capitalized and the value is correctly retrieved from the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
