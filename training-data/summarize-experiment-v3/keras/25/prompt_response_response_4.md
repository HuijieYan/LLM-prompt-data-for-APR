## Bug's Cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the data format within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. Specifically, the bug arises from the subtraction operation performed on the 'x' input array, which leads to a type casting error.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the data format should be correctly handled in the function, and the subtraction operation on the input array should be performed in a way that avoids type casting errors.

## The Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected function, the subtraction and normalization operations are performed according to the data format and mode, ensuring that type casting errors are avoided.
