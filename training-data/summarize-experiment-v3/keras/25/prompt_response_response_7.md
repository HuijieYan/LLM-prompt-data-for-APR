## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs due to the improper processing of the input array 'x' based on the given 'mode' and 'data_format' arguments. The error arises from the subtraction operation on the 'x' input array, leading to a data type mismatch and the error message `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.

## Bug Fixing Approach

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the data format and mode, ensuring that the preprocessing operations are applied to the input array 'x' as expected. Modifications are needed to accurately handle the mean pixel centering and channel normalization based on the input parameters.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Apply normalization
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean  # Apply mean pixel centering

    return x
```

With these corrections, the function should accurately preprocess the input array 'x' based on the provided data format and mode, ensuring that the mean pixel centering and channel normalization are applied correctly.
