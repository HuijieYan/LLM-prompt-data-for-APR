In the provided case, the function is expected to preprocess a Numpy array with specific values and a data format of "channels_last" when the mode is set to "caffe." However, the current implementation does not handle the data format correctly, resulting in the incorrect preprocessing of the input array. This leads to discrepancies in the expected and actual output values, specifically with the 'x' array and the 'mean' list. The function does not correctly apply the mean pixel centering and channel normalization according to the expected values. Therefore, the discrepancies highlight that the current implementation of the function is not working properly for the given cases.
