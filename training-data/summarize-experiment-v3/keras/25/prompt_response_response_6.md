## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs due to the incorrect processing of the input array based on the provided input mode and data format. This leads to discrepancies in the output array and the mean pixel values, causing the failing test case and the error message.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the mean pixel centering and channel normalization based on the input data format and mode. This results in a mismatch in the shape and data type of the output array, leading to the failing test and the error message `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the preprocessing of the input array should be revised to correctly handle the data format and mode, ensuring that the mean subtraction and channel normalization are applied appropriately based on the input data. This will involve adjusting the conditional branches for different modes and data formats, as well as properly applying the mean pixel centering and channel normalization operations to the input array.


## The Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        # Caffe mode or default
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x = x - mean

    return x
```

In the corrected code, the preprocessing operations are adjusted to handle different modes and data formats properly. Additionally, the mean subtraction and channel normalization operations are applied according to the specified mode, ensuring that the output array matches the expected values for the given input parameters.
