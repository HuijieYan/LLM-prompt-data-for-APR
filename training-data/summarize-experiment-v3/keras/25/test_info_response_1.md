The failing test `test_preprocess_input` in `imagenet_utils_test.py` file checks the behavior of the function `preprocess_input` from `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` given various input shapes, types, and formats. The failing test occurs in line 15, where the output shape from preprocessing an int32 array is being incorrectly asserted. The error trace points out the execution path to the corresponding call in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, where the bug is due to the subtraction operation performed on the 'x' input array, leading to the error `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.
