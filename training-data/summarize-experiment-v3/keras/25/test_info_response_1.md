The failing test is related to the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function in the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` file. The error message indicates that a UFuncTypeError occurred at line 82 of the file in the `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` line. This happened because the function tried to cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'. Thus, pointing out to the mode that was initially set as 'torch' but changed afterwards.
