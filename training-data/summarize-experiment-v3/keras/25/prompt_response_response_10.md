## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug is in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, where the subtraction operation performed on the 'x' input array is causing a data type mismatch, leading to the error `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is that the subtraction operation performed on the 'x' input array results in a data type mismatch, leading to the error.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the subtraction operation needs to be handled in a way that maintains the data type integrity of the input array. Additionally, the mean pixel centering and channel normalization should be correctly applied according to the expected data format and values.

## Corrected Code

The corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is as follows:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """

        x = (x / 127.5) - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

                x /= np.array(std)

    return x
