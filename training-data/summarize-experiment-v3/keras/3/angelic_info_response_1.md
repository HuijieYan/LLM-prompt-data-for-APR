In the given buggy function, _clone_functional_model, there are several cases in which the expected output does not match the current output. For instance, when input_tensors is None, the function is expected to create new input placeholders, but the function does not generate the expected output. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the creation of new layers and the mapping of input tensors to corresponding tensors and masks, leading to unexpected behavior in certain cases. These discrepancies highlight the need for thorough testing and debugging of the _clone_functional_model function to ensure it reproduces the behavior of the original model accurately.
