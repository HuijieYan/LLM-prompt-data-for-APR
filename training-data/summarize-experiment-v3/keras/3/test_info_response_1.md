The failing test "test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs" in the "test_sequential_model.py" file reveals an AssertionError that is raised during the attempt to clone a functional model. The error originates from the "_clone_functional_model" function in the "keras/models.py" file at line 166, where an assertion fails because the output tensor could not be computed. This is due to the fact that a specific tensor with the name "swap_layer_1/Identity:0" is not found in the tensor map. This suggests a potential bug in handling the creation or mapping of tensors when cloning the functional model, which is causing the failure.
