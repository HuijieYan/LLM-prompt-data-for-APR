The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` triggers an `AssertionError` when calling `keras.models.clone_model(model)` in the `tests/keras/test_sequential_model.py` file at line 360. This calls the `_clone_functional_model` function in `keras/models.py` at line 166 where the error occurs. Within the `_clone_functional_model` function, the error is related to the failure of computing the output tensor, specifically for the tensor with the name "swap_layer_1/Identity:0". This indicates that there is an issue with the computation of the outputs when creating the new model.
