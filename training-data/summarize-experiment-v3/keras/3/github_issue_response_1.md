Based on the information provided in the GitHub issue, the bug in the `clone_model` function seems to be related to the handling of the layer masks. The issue description mentioned that the `output_masks` will always be [None] when using a layer without mask support, which leads to the error "Could not compute output Tensor". This error seems to occur when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support, such as the Lambda layer. Therefore, the faulty behavior in the `clone_model` function is likely linked to the incorrect handling of layer masks, leading to the appearance of the error when using certain types of layers within the model.
