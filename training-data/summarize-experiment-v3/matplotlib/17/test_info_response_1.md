The stack trace of the failing test provides the error on the maxabsvalue calculation inside the nonsingular function. The error is a RuntimeWarning "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" and "overflow encountered in scalar subtract". It occurs when attempting to compute the maximum absolute value of the provided min and max values, which is consistent with the assertion that the inputs are (-32768, 0). Therefore, the bug is likely to be in the calculation of the maximum absolute value in the nonsingular function.
