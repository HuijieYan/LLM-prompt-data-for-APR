In case 1, the expected value for the variable `maxabsvalue` is 1, while the function does not update this variable in the code; it should be evaluated and changed accordingly. In case 2, the variable `maxabsvalue` should have the expected value of 1.5, but does not get updated within the function as per the provided code. In case 3, the function should swap `vmin` and `vmax` and update `swapped` variable to `True` if `vmin > vmax`, however, the function's return value for `vmin` and `vmax` does not match the expected output. Additionally, in case 3, the fetched value of `maxabsvalue` is incorrect. In the last case, the return values for `vmin` and `vmax` are not as expected for the input parameters provided; the function should properly handle the infinite values of `vmin` and `vmax` as required.
