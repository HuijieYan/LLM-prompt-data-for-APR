The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the unconditioned setting of `self._filled` to `True`, which may be causing the unexpected behavior indicated in the failing tests.

The bug's cause is that the `_recache` method unconditionally sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified for the markers. This can lead to markers being filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should only set `self._filled` to `True` if the `fillstyle` is any value other than 'none'. Otherwise, it should set `self._filled` to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check fillstyle to determine if markers should be filled
    if self.fillstyle and self.fillstyle != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By implementing this change, the `_recache` method will now correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the value of `self.fillstyle`. This should address the issue of markers being filled when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
