## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/matplotlib_3/lib/matplotlib/markers.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data points in a plot or chart. The related function `_recache` appears to handle the recalculation or updating of certain attributes.

`_recache(self)`: This function seems to reset or recalculate various attributes of the marker style, potentially based on some marker function. The function relies on the existence and execution of the `_marker_function` method.

`_marker_function`: Presumably a method that defines the markers and their properties, and is called within the `_recache` function to update the marker style attributes.

The interactions with the `MarkerStyle` class and its related functions should be considered in addressing the issue with the `_recache` function.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test is related to the `test_marker_fillstyle` function in the test_marker.py test file. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should not be. This can be traced back to the `_recache` method in the source code, where the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the issue.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Runtime values and types of the input parameters:
    - self._fillstyle, value: 'none', type: str
- Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return:
    - self._filled, value: False, type: bool
Rational: The discrepancy between the expectant value of self._filled and the actual value indicates an issue in the logic that sets the variable within the _recache function. This discrepancy may be the root cause of the failing tests.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the expected case 1, the function should set the variable `self._path` to the specified Path array, with a shape of None. However, it seems that the function is not correctly updating this variable as per the expected value. Additionally, the `self._snap_threshold` is expected to be `inf`, but it is not being set to this value. These discrepancies suggest that the function is not behaving as expected and may contain a bug.


# A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
The markers are not hollow when I use ax.scatter() and set markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. My usage is wrong?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a costomed markers.MarkerStyle and set the paramter fillstyle='none'. But I don't get what I want.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np
xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
