Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data points in a plot or chart. The related function `_recache` appears to handle the recalculation or updating of certain attributes.

`_recache(self)`: This function seems to reset or recalculate various attributes of the marker style, potentially based on some marker function. The function relies on the existence and execution of the `_marker_function` method.

`_marker_function`: Presumably a method that defines the markers and their properties, and is called within the `_recache` function to update the marker style attributes.

The interactions with the `MarkerStyle` class and its related functions should be considered in addressing the issue with the `_recache` function.
