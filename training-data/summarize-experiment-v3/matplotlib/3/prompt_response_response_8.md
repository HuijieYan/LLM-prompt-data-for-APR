The potential error location within the `_recache` function is the unconditional assignment of `self._filled` to `True`, which may be causing the issue with filled markers.

The bug's cause can be identified as follows:
(a) The `_recache` function unconditionally sets `self._filled` to `True`.
(b) The `MarkerStyle` class documentation suggests that the `filled` attribute determines whether a marker is filled or not.
(c) The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which is returning `True` when it should not be.
(d) The error message is likely related to the filled markers not behaving as expected when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
(e) The actual input/output variable values include the `self._filled` variable, which is set to `False` initially, but unconditionally set to `True` within the `_recache` function.
(f) The expected input/output variable values include `self._filled` being set to `False` or `True` based on the desired filled or unfilled marker behavior.
(g) The GitHub issue posted by a user also describes the problem of markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This aligns with the issue observed in the code.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to conditionally set the `self._filled` attribute based on the desired marker fill behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set _snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Conditionally set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected code addresses the issue by conditionally setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` to ensure that markers are filled or unfilled as expected. This change should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` behaves as expected.
