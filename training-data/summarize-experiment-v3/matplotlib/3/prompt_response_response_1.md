The potential error location within the buggy function is the unconditional setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This is likely causing the issue with markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The bug's cause is that the `_filled` attribute is being unconditionally set to `True` within the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified in the MarkerStyle object. This contradicts the expected behavior where setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `_recache` function should be updated to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on it. The `_marker_function` method may also need to be revised to correctly define markers and their properties.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With the updated conditional logic, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the markers are correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
