Based on the expected case 1, the function should set the variable `self._path` to the specified Path array, with a shape of None. However, it seems that the function is not correctly updating this variable as per the expected value. Additionally, the `self._snap_threshold` is expected to be `inf`, but it is not being set to this value. These discrepancies suggest that the function is not behaving as expected and may contain a bug.
