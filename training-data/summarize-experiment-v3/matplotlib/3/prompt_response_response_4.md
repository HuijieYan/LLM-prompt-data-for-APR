The bug seems to be in the `_recache` function, specifically with the unconditional setting of the `self._filled` attribute to `True`. This un-conditionality might be causing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object to return `True` when it should not be, leading to the failing test and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, a conditional check should be added to correctly set the `self._filled` variable based on the input `self._fillstyle` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # setting _snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Fixing the bug by adding a conditional check for self._fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'full':
        self._filled = True
    elif self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        # if fillstyle is neither 'full' nor 'none', default to True
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the conditional check ensures that the `self._filled` attribute is set based on the `self._fillstyle` input, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
