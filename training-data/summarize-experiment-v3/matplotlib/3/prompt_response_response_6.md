## Bug Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the `_recache` method unconditionally setting the `self._filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the input `fillstyle` parameter.

## Approach to Fix

To fix the bug, the `_recache` method should be updated to appropriately handle the value of the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `self._filled` attribute based on the input `fillstyle`.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, the `_recache` method now takes into account the `fillstyle` parameter and appropriately updates the `self._filled` attribute based on its value. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', `self._filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, `self._filled` is set to `True`.

This should resolve the issue related to markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' and ensure that the markers behave as expected.
