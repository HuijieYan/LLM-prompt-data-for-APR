The failing test is related to the `test_marker_fillstyle` function in the test_marker.py test file. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should not be. This can be traced back to the `_recache` method in the source code, where the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the issue.
