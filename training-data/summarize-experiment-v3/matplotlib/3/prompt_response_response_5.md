The bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the unconditional setting of `self._filled` attribute to `True`, leading to markers being filled when they should not be, as reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the logic setting the `self._filled` attribute should be modified to conditionally set it based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
  
    # Conditionally set _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
  
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function now conditionally sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
