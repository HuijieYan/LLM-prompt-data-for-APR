The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on the specified levels. The function uses the `index._get_level_number` method to get the level number of specified levels, but it encounters issues when processing multi-level indices.

The error message suggests that the problematic line is `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where the `index._get_level_number` method fails to handle multi-level indices and raises a `ValueError` because it cannot find the specified level.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle multi-level indices, which leads to the `ValueError` and `KeyError` being raised when attempting to unstack the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle multi-level indices properly. This can be achieved by treating the specified levels differently when the index is a MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex):
        # Handle MultiIndex levels
        level_numbers = [data.index.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]
        unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Handle regular index
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The modified function ensures that when the index is a MultiIndex, it correctly uses the level numbers to unstack the DataFrame, resolving the issues with multi-level indices. This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
