The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is a part of the module `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` and it utilizes the function `unstack` from the same file. The main issue in the buggy function seems to be the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns when unstacking the data.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the section where it checks whether `rlocs` is empty and then creates the `dummy_index`. This logic seems to be flawed as it doesn't properly handle hierarchical columns. Additionally, there are conditional blocks for handling `Series` and handling `MultiIndex` data, which might also contribute to the issue.

The cause of the bug may stem from the function's logic not accounting for hierarchical columns properly, leading to incorrect unstacking of the data.

One approach for fixing the bug could be to refactor the logic for handling hierarchical columns, ensuring that the code properly considers the structure of the hierarchical index. Another approach could be to simplify the conditional blocks for handling different data types (Series and MultiIndex) to make the code more manageable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function code goes here, with the hierarchical index handling properly refactored
```

The rest of the function would need to be refactored to properly handle hierarchical index and ensure correct unstacking of the data.
