```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):  
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs] 
    else: 
        clocs = list(clocs) 

    ...
```
In this buggy function, the `_get_level_number` function is not handling the case of multi-level names, causing a KeyError. The solution is to add a check to detect the case of multi-level names and convert it to a list before use.
This should solve the KeyError issue in the failing test.
