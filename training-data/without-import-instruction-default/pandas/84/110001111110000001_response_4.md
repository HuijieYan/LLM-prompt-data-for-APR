The buggy function is the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is used to unstack a DataFrame along multiple levels. The error seems to be occurring during the process of finding the level number for a given name within the MultiIndex.

The failing test is trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex using a tuple of names as the level. The error message suggests that the function is unable to find the level number for the name 'A' within the MultiIndex.

The potential error location is within the `_get_level_number` method used to find the level number for a given name. The error seems to occur when the method is unable to find the specified name within the MultiIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to identify the correct level number for the specified name within the MultiIndex, and the function should be able to handle different types of level specifications, such as tuples of names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Replace the existing code that gets level number with a new approach to handle different level specifications
    def get_level_number(level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in level]
            return tuple(level_numbers)
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(level)

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should be able to handle different level specifications, such as tuples of names, and should pass the failing test case.
