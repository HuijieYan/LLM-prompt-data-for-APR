### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to handle unstacking with a MultiIndex. The function processes the index, changes the columns, and returns the unstacked result. However, it fails to correctly process the index, resulting in a ValueError or KeyError.

The failing test cases `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are attempting to use the `unstack` method but encountering errors due to the incorrect handling of the MultiIndex within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The error messages indicate that the function is unable to find the specified level in the MultiIndex, leading to either a ValueError or KeyError.

### 2. Potential Error Location
The potential error is most likely in the processing of levels and names within the MultiIndex. Specifically, the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` might be causing the issue.

### 3. Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the MultiIndex, leading to errors in accessing the levels and names.

In the failing test cases, the code calls the `unstack` method with specified levels, but the `_unstack_multiple` function fails to correctly identify and process these levels within the MultiIndex, leading to errors.

### 4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Verify that the levels and names are being accessed correctly.
2. Ensure that the function can handle the specified levels and process the MultiIndex accordingly.
3. Check for edge cases where the MultiIndex properties may vary.

### 5. Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # Replace the problematic line with a more robust approach to handle MultiIndex levels
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional check to handle the case where the index might not be a MultiIndex and updated the line to handle it appropriately. This change should ensure that the levels are processed correctly, fixing the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
