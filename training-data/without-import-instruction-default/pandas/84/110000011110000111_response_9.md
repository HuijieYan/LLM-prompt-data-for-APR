The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is trying to find the level number for a tuple name in the MultiIndex, which is causing a ValueError or KeyError.

Upon analyzing the failing test function and error message, it is evident that the `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling the case where the columns have a MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.

The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` is failing because the function is unable to find the level number for the tuple name "A" in the MultiIndex, and similarly for other failing tests. This issue has been raised on GitHub as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly. This can be achieved by correctly identifying the levels and extracting the information from a MultiIndex with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocations = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By checking if the input is a tuple or not, and then getting the level number accordingly, this correction will handle the MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
