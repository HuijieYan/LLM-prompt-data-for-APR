The issue arises in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to incorrect handling of the `clocs` variable, which should be transformed to level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` method. This method throws a KeyError when it encounters a tuple name, as seen in the GitHub issue.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the `clocs` variable and avoid using the `_get_level_number` method when the input is a tuple name. Instead, we can use a different method or approach to handle the tuple name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function based on the analysis and the expected value and type of variables:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index

    levels = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level = [index.names.index(name) for name in loc]
            levels.append(level)
        else:
            level = index._get_level_number(loc)
            levels.append(level)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle the `clocs` variable correctly and avoid the KeyError when encountering tuple names. This would resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
