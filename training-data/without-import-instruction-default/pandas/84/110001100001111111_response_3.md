The bug is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function failing to handle a multi-level index correctly. The function attempts to extract the level numbers of the columns, but it does not handle tuple names properly and raises a `KeyError`. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError".

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to correctly handle multi-level indexes with tuple names.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the code to handle the case when the column locator (`clocs`) is a tuple. This can be done by checking the type of `clocs` and retrieving the level numbers accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # if clocs is a tuple, retrieve the level numbers for the tuple names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        index = data.index
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, str) else c for c in clocs]
    else:
        index = data.index
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now properly handle multi-level indexes with tuple names and resolve the `KeyError` reported in the GitHub issue.

This modified code takes into account the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values and addresses the reported issue.
