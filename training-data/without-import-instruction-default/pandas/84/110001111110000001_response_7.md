The problematic function appears to be `_unstack_multiple`. The error message indicates that the issue arises when trying to get the level number from a `MultiIndex`. Since the error message points to the code `level = self.names.index(level)`, it seems that the issue might be with how the function is trying to obtain the level index.

The function also seems to be dealing with MultiIndex objects and attempting to unstack them, which involves manipulating the index, levels, and codes. The function handles different scenarios based on whether the data is a Series, whether the columns are MultiIndex, and if the unstacked result is a Series or DataFrame.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to review the handling of MultiIndex objects within the function, specifically the method used to obtain the level index. Additionally, ensuring that the manipulation of index, levels, and codes is done correctly for all the different scenarios would be crucial.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

It's important to note that the correction assumes that the `clocs` parameter is provided appropriately and that the `unstack` method from the `data` object works correctly for the specified `clocs`. Further testing may be required to ensure the functionality of the corrected code.
