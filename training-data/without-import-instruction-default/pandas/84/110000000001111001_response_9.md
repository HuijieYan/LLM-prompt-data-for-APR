The buggy function is intended to unstack a multi-level DataFrame. However, it seems to have several issues, including incorrect handling of index names, and inappropriate reshaping of the data. 

Upon analysis of the input and output variables, it seems that the bug is likely located in the portion of the function where it creates a new index and reshapes the DataFrame. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual values of variables like `dummy`, `unstacked`, `new_levels`, and `new_columns`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the multi-level index and columns, and reshape the DataFrame accordingly. One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to utilize the `pivot_table` method to achieve the desired reshaping, ensuring that the reshaping aligns with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Pivot the data to the expected shape
    unstacked = data.pivot_table(index=data.index.names, columns=clocs, values=data.columns[0], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the `pivot_table` method to reshape the DataFrame according to the expected multi-level index and columns, thus addressing the issues identified in the buggy function.
