The issue seems to be in the `_get_level_number` function within the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module. The error message indicates that the function is trying to find the index of a level that is not present, resulting in a KeyError or ValueError.

The failing tests are associated with the `unstack` method for DataFrames, which utilizes the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error occurs when trying to find the level number for 'A' in the MultiIndex, which is not present.

This bug may be related to the way level names are being handled by the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the block where it tries to get the level number by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`. In the failing tests, 'A' is a level name, not a numeric level number, which seems to be causing the issue.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to handle the case where level names are provided as input when determining the level number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function unchanged
```

In this corrected version, the function uses the `_get_level_number` method to get the level numbers from the level names provided in `clocs`.

This corrected version should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
