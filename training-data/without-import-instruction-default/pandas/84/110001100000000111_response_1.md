The source of the error is likely the `_get_level_number` function used in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the level "A" is not found, which suggests an issue with parsing the multi-level index. The GitHub issue also mentions that multi-index unstack with tuple names fails with a KeyError, which aligns with the error message provided.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle the parsing of multi-level indices, particularly when unstacking with tuple names. The issue seems to be related to parsing multi-level indices and unstacking them, so the bug is likely in the parsing or handling of the levels within the multi-level index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking the parsing of multi-level indices to ensure that tuple names are correctly handled.
2. Verifying the code that extracts levels and codes from the multi-level index to identify any potential issues with parsing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + list(clevels)  # Convert clevels to list for concatenation
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + list(cnames)  # Convert cnames to list for concatenation

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns =  MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and handle unstacking of multi-level indices with tuple names.
