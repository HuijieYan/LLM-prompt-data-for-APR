The issue in the code seems to be with the `_unstack_multiple` function when handling MultiIndex with tuple names. The error message indicates that the function is unable to find the specified level in the MultiIndex.

The failing test functions `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` from the test file `pandas/tests/frame/test_reshape.py` are encountering errors when trying to unstack the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError and ValueError.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" provides an example of the MultiIndex unstack failing with the error message and asks for input from specific developers.

To resolve this issue, the `_get_level_number` function within the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly and find the correct level.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to make changes in the `_get_level_number` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

By incorporating this change in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the function should now be able to handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly and should pass the failing test cases. This should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
