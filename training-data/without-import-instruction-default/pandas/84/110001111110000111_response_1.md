The bug is caused by the function `_get_level_number` in the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file. This function is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file and is responsible for returning the level number for a given level name. However, the function is throwing a `ValueError` because the level name is not found.

The issue arises when the level name is provided as a tuple, such as `("A", "a")`. The `_get_level_number` function does not handle tuple names correctly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle tuple level names properly. The code should be updated to handle both single string names and tuple names as input.

Based on the failing test and error message, it is clear that the issue is with handling tuple names in the MultiIndex. The correct approach would be to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple names and return the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function will handle both single string level names and tuple level names correctly.

This updated code should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
