The bug is being caused by the `_get_level_number` function when it tries to find the index of a name in the list of names, it's failing and raising a ValueError or KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling hierarchical columns correctly, and it is not handling the case when it receives a tuple of names as the `level` argument.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case when it receives a tuple of names as the `level` argument and hierarchically structured column index.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By making this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle the multi-level column index and correctly process the tuple of names as the `level` argument.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
