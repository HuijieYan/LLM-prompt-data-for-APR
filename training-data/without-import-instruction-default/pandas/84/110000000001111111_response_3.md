The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the `KeyError` when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names. This is occurring due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex with tuple names, as observed in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location in the code is in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the way it is handling the levels and names of the MultiIndex.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect processing of the MultiIndex with tuple names, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the level number. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values, as well as the GitHub issue information.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the MultiIndex with tuple names when unstacking.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.get_level_values(index.names[i]) for i in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The above code handles the hierarchical columns correctly and uses `index.get_level_values` to retrieve the level values when the level is a tuple. This corrected code should now successfully unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
