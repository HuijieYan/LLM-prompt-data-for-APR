The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because it is not correctly handling the case of unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names. The function is trying to use the index's `_get_level_number` method to determine the level number, but it is encountering an error and raising a KeyError.

Based on the failing test and error message, it is evident that the function is not properly handling the tuple names in the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names to level numbers
    clocs = [index.names.index(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):
        result = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

By using the `index.names.index(c)` method, we can properly handle the tuple names in the MultiIndex and convert them to level numbers. This should resolve the KeyError issue and ensure that the function can handle unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex.

This corrected code should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It will also address the GitHub issue related to unstacking with tuple names.
