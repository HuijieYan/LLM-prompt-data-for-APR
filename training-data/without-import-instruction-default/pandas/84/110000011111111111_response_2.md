The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because it is trying to handle multi-level index columns, but it is not correctly identifying the levels when the input parameter is a tuple with multiple names.

The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex, where it is trying to find the level number for the input level name. However, it's failing to find the level number for a tuple of names, resulting in a KeyError or ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle input parameters that are tuples with multiple names for the columns.

Based on the expected input/output variable values and the github issue, we can conclude that the bug is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function not correctly identifying the levels when the input parameter is a tuple with multiple names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert single tuple input to a list for consistency
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if not all(isinstance(c, int) for c in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle input parameters that are tuples with multiple names for the columns, and it should pass the failing test while also satisfying the expected input/output variable values provided.

After making these changes, the function should be re-tested with the failing test case, and it should pass successfully.
