1. The buggy function seems to be trying to unstack the data and create a new DataFrame with MultiIndex based on the provided columns. However, there are several conditional checks and transformations happening within the function, leading to potential errors.

2. The potential error location within the function seems to be where it checks the data type and structure and then tries to unstack and create a new MultiIndex.

3. The bug's cause could be due to the conditional checks and transformations within the function, leading to incorrect handling of different data types and structures.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Refactor the conditional checks and transformations to ensure consistent handling of different data types and structures.
   - Use appropriate error handling and validation to handle edge cases and unexpected data input.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected code, the unnecessary conditional checks and transformations have been removed. The function now directly uses the `unstack` method on the data, handling both Series and DataFrame inputs. This simplifies the logic and improves readability.
