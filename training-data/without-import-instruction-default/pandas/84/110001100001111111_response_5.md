The problem in the function `_unstack_multiple` is that it attempts to unstack MultiIndex using a tuple of names for the levels, but it incorrectly processes the tuple and causes a KeyError.

The error is located within the `_unstack_multiple` function where it tries to find the level number for each item in the `clocs` list. It uses `index._get_level_number(i)` to obtain the level number, where `i` is a tuple of names. This is the cause of the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the implementation of `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle the tuple of names correctly and obtain the level numbers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for obtaining the level numbers from the tuple of names.
2. Ensure that the correct level numbers and names are used when unstacking the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)  # Use the unstack method directly

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the `unstack` method of the DataFrame directly, passing the level numbers obtained from the tuple of names to unstack the MultiIndex correctly. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information while also fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
