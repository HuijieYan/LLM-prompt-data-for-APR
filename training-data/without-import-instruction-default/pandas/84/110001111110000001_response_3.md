The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is a part of the pandas library and is used for unstacking data within a DataFrame or Series along a specific level. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the issue lies in the `_get_level_number` function which is attempting to retrieve the index of a level from a MultiIndex object. The error message suggests that the level 'A' is not found in the list of names.

The potential error location within the `_unstack_multiple` function is the line where the `clocs` variable is being populated:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This code is trying to get the level numbers for the given levels, but it seems to be causing errors when dealing with hierarchical columns.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not handling hierarchical columns properly, resulting in issues with getting the level numbers for the columns.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle hierarchical columns correctly and make necessary adjustments when dealing with MultiIndex objects.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

        shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
        group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

        comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
        recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
        # ...

    else:
        # Non-MultiIndex data handling
        if isinstance(data, Series):
            unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version includes a conditional check at the beginning to handle MultiIndex objects separately. When the `index` is a MultiIndex, it properly extracts the levels, codes, and names. This should address the issues with hierarchical columns and level numbers.
