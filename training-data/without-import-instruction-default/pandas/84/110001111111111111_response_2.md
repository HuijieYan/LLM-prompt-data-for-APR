The issue lies in the _unstack_multiple function, specifically in the section where it tries to get the level number of each level in the clocs list. The current implementation fails to handle tuple names properly in MultiIndex.

The bug occurs due to the _get_level_number function, which does not handle tuple names correctly in MultiIndex. This results in a KeyError when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

To fix this bug, the _get_level_number function needs to be modified to handle tuple names correctly in MultiIndex. Additionally, the code in the _unstack_multiple function that utilizes the _get_level_number function needs to be updated to account for the changes in the _get_level_number function.

The corrected code for the _get_level_number function and the _unstack_multiple function should handle tuple names properly in MultiIndex, ensuring that the unstack operation works as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the _get_level_number function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = [self.names.index(l) for l in level]
    else:
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            if not is_integer(level):
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    return level
```

And here is the corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # the rest of the function remains the same
```

By making these changes, the _get_level_number function will now handle tuple names correctly in MultiIndex, and the _unstack_multiple function will use the updated _get_level_number function to ensure proper handling of tuple names when unstacking a MultiIndex.

With these corrections, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
