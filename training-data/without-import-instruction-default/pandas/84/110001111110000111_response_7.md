The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to unstack a MultiIndex in the input data. The error arises in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` which is trying to retrieve the level number for the input levels `clocs`.

The failing tests indicate that the error is due to the function not handling tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly.

The GitHub issue also provides a similar case where the unstacking of a MultiIndex with tuple names fails with a KeyError.

To fix the bug:
1. Rewrite the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the scenario where the MultiIndex has tuple names properly.
2. This can be achieved by modifying the logic of extracting the level number for input levels `clocs` and handling the tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify the way level number is extracted for input levels clocs
    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        level_number = index._get_level_number(cloc[0])  # Extract the level number from the first part of the tuple name
        cloc_numbers.append(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By updating the code in this manner, the function should correctly handle the scenario where the MultiIndex has tuple names, and should pass the failing test cases, as well as resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
