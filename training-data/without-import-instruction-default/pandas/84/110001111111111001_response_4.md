### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to perform unstacking of a multi-index DataFrame. However, the function seems to have issues with handling multi-level index names. The error message indicates that the function is trying to locate a level named 'A' in the multi-index when 'A' is not an integer, and this is causing a KeyError. This points towards the `_get_level_number` function where the issue seems to be occurring.

### Potential Bug Location
The potential bug location is within the `_get_level_number` function, where it tries to identify the level number for a given level. It seems to be encountering an issue when the level name is not an integer.

### Bug Cause
The `_get_level_number` function seems to be assuming that multi-index level names must be integers. This assumption is leading to errors when non-integer level names are encountered.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle non-integer level names by either returning the level directly if it's an integer or finding the index corresponding to the level name in the list of names.
2. Ensure that the rest of the code in `_unstack_multiple` and related functions appropriately handle non-integer level names.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if not all(isinstance(c, int) for c in clocs):
        clocs = [index.names.index(c) if not isinstance(c, int) else c for c in clocs]

    # rest of the function implementation...
```

By introducing a check to handle non-integer level names in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we can avoid the key error caused by the assumption that level names are always integers. This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the function can handle non-integer level names properly.
