The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `clocs` input parameter. The function tries to access the level number using the `_get_level_number` method, but it encounters errors because the `clocs` variable is a tuple or a combination of levels and not just a single level. This causes the function to raise ValueError or KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` variable needs to be appropriately handled to extract the level numbers before using them to manipulate the DataFrame.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to iterate through the levels in the `clocs` tuple, extract the level numbers, and then use them to perform the unstack operation on the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]
    
    # perform unstack operation using cloc_numbers
    unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, we check if `clocs` is a tuple and iterate through it to extract level numbers, or if it's a single level, we directly extract the level number. Then, the unstack operation is performed using the extracted level numbers.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
