The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is being called by the `unstack` method in Pandas. The error message indicates that the `Level A not found` KeyError is being raised when the `index._get_level_number` function is called. This suggests that there is an issue with locating the level in the index, possibly due to the tuple name format used in the MultiIndex.

The failing test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` provide detailed scenarios for the failure, indicating that the error occurs when unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex.

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" details a similar problem, where unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex leads to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle tuple names in MultiIndex. This may involve adjusting how the level numbers are retrieved and used within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Store the original names to handle hierarchical columns
    names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    # Handle MultiIndex columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(names)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function creates a list of levels to unstack and then uses the `unstack` method to handle unstacking. If the data has MultiIndex columns, it reorders the columns according to the original names.

This corrected function should handle the unstacking of MultiIndex with tuple names and pass the failing tests while resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
