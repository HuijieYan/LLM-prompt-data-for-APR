The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to a KeyError when trying to get the level number from the MultiIndex. The issue occurs when the function tries to get the level number for a tuple name in the MultiIndex.

The failing test indicates that the unstack operation is failing for a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The expected input parameters include a MultiIndex with tuple names and the expected output needs to match the values specified in the failing test.

The GitHub Issue details a similar problem faced by a user when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle tuple names correctly when getting the level number, indexing, and unstacking operations.

Here's the corrected function for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    
    levels = [cloc[0] for cloc in clocs]
    codes = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in levels]
    names = [cloc[1] for cloc in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(c, name) for c in data.columns for name in names], names=[None, *names])
    
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function will handle tuple names correctly during unstacking and ensure that the expected output matches the specified values in the failing test.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle unstacking of a MultiIndex with tuple names and pass the failing test case.
