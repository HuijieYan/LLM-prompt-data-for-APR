The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` arises from the incorrect conversion of the tuple input `clocs` to the corresponding level numbers in the MultiIndex. This leads to the incorrect unstacking of the DataFrame.

The potential error location is in the following code block:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The input parameter `clocs` is a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, but the function incorrectly assumes that `clocs` is a tuple of strings. This causes the KeyError when trying to access the level number for the tuple.

To fix the bug, the function should handle tuples as multi-level index names properly. This can be achieved by checking the type of the elements of `clocs` and handling tuples differently from strings.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function to check if the elements of `clocs` are strings or tuples, and handle them accordingly to retrieve the level numbers from the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, str):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))
        elif isinstance(loc, tuple):
            levels = [index._get_level_number(l) for l in loc]
            cloc_numbers.append(levels)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Remaining code for unstacking data based on cloc_numbers and rlocs...
```

By checking the type of the elements in `clocs`, the function now correctly handles both single-level and multi-level index names and retrieves the level numbers appropriately. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and ensure that the function behaves correctly for the given input/output variable information.
