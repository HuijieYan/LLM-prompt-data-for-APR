The buggy function is _unstack_multiple in the file pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py. The function is used to unstack a multi-index DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line tries to get the level number for each item in clocs, which could be causing the KeyError in the GitHub issue.

According to the GitHub issue, the problem arises when trying to unstack a multi-index Series using a tuple of names as the level argument. This triggers a KeyError because the function is unable to find the level "A" or "B".

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the input tuple of names when unstacking a multi-index Series. It is also not adequately dealing with hierarchical columns.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code to properly handle tuple of names as the level argument when unstacking a multi-index Series. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle hierarchical columns correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy.index.droplevel(clocs)  # Dropping specified levels
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # ... (existing code)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code includes handling the input tuple of names when unstacking a multi-index Series and dropping specified levels using `droplevel()`. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.
