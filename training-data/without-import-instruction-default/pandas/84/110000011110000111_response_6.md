The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` appears to be an internal function for unstacking a MultiIndex. The failing test depicts the scenario where unstacking using tuple names in a MultiIndex fails with a KeyError or ValueError. The error is raised at the `_get_level_number` method when trying to retrieve the level number for a specific level.

The GitHub issue further emphasizes the difficulty faced in unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The issue seems to be with the handling of tuple names in MultiIndex during unstacking, which causes the `_get_level_number` method to raise KeyError or ValueError.

To fix this bug, the handling of tuple names in MultiIndex needs to be improved, specifically in the `_get_level_number` method. The method should correctly handle tuple names and return the appropriate level number.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Unstack with regular index
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version simplifies the unstacking process, especially when dealing with MultiIndex. It checks if the unstacked index would be a regular index or a MultiIndex and performs the unstacking accordingly.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub post.
