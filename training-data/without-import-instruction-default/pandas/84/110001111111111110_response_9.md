# Corrected function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert the tuple names to lists for compatibility with the _get_level_number function
    clocs = list(clocs)

    # Retrieve the level numbers for the given names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

The issue in the original code arises from the function `_get_level_number` not being able to handle tuple names. The corrected function first converts the tuple names to lists and then retrieves the level numbers using a combination of tuple and single string levels if necessary.

This should resolve the KeyError issue and the unstacking operation with mixed tuple and single string level names in a MultiIndex DataFrame should work as expected.
