The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex. The function is failing when the `unstack` method is called with a tuple of names as the `level` parameter. This is resulting in a `KeyError` or a `ValueError` when trying to get the level number from the index.

The issue arises because the function is not correctly handling hierarchical columns yet, and it is trying to get the level number directly from the MultiIndex, which is causing the errors.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified such that it correctly handles both regular indices and MultiIndex. The code needs to check if the index is a MultiIndex, and if so, it should properly handle the unstacking process. The function should also correctly handle the case where the index names are tuples. The correction should ensure that the unstacking process works for MultiIndex with tuple names as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling hierarchical columns in MultiIndex
    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result
    
    else:
        # For regular index
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy_index = pd.Index([i for i in range(len(dummy))])
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function will handle both regular indices and MultiIndex correctly, fixing the issues with unstacking multi-index with tuple names. This corrected function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
