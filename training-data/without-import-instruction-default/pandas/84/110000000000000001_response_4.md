1. The given function takes in data, column locations (clocs), and a fill value as inputs. It then performs unstacking operations on the data based on the column locations.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the unstacking process and the handling of MultiIndex data.

3. The cause of the bug could be an issue with the unstacking process, especially when dealing with MultiIndex data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the unstacking process is correctly handling MultiIndex data.
   - Check for any inconsistencies in the handling of index and column names and codes.
   - Verify that the new indices and columns are properly assigned.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked = unstacked.reorder_levels([*rlocs, *clocs])

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code:
- We use the built-in `unstack` method from the pandas library to handle the unstacking process.
- For data that is not a Series, we reorder the levels after unstacking to ensure proper alignment.
- We simplified the code and removed unnecessary variable assignments and operations.
