The issue seems to originate from the `_get_level_number` method, where the level is not found in the list of names. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` method should be modified to handle the level when it is a tuple. Additionally, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be updated to address this issue.

Based on the provided information, here's a possible approach to fix the bug:

1. Update the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class to handle the case when the level is a tuple. This can be done by iterating through the tuple and retrieving the level number for each component of the tuple.

2. Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to accommodate the changes made in the `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with the necessary changes:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Other parts of the function unchanged

    index = data.index

    # Handle tuple names in MultiIndex
    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc_numbers = index._get_level_number(loc)
            cloc_numbers.extend(loc_numbers)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    clocs = cloc_numbers

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the case when the level is a tuple in the MultiIndex.

After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to verify that the bug has been fixed. If the tests pass, the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function can be submitted as a potential fix for the bug.
