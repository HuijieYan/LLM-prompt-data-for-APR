The code is failing due to issues related to multi-index unstacking. The error message shows that the "Level A not found" and "ValueError: 'A' is not in the list" exceptions are raised when calling the unstack method on a DataFrame with a multi-index.

To fix this issue, the _unstack_multiple function's implementation needs to be corrected to handle the specific case of multi-index unstacking with tuple names.

Here's the corrected and updated function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        return data.unstack(clocs)

    result = data
    for loc in clocs:
        loc_indices = [result.columns.get_loc(label) if isinstance(label, tuple) else label for label in loc]
        result = result.unstack(loc_indices)

    return result
```

The main changes made in the updated function are:
1. Check if the columns of the DataFrame are of type MultiIndex. If they are not, directly call the unstack method with the provided clocs and return the result.
2. If the columns are of type MultiIndex, retrieve the numerical indices for the specified levels present in clocs using get_loc.
3. Then, perform unstacking based on the computed numerical indices.

These changes help to circumvent the problems encountered in the original function and ensure that the unstacking process is carried out correctly, especially for multi-index data with tuple names.

This fix will resolve the reported KeyError and ValueError when performing unstack on a DataFrame with a multi-index containing tuple names.

The corrected function can now be deployed and tested to ensure that the multi-index unstacking operations work as expected for various scenarios.
