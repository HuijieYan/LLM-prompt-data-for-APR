The issue is occurring in the `_get_level_number` function which is being used within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error is related to the `clocs` variable which is not being handled correctly. It seems that the `clocs` variable is a tuple when it should be a list, leading to an error when trying to get the level number from the MultiIndex.

The potential bug is in the way `clocs` is being processed and handled within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` parameter is always converted to a list before processing it further. We can then iterate over the elements of the list and get the level number for each element.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert clocs to a list

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `clocs` parameter correctly and avoid the error that was occurring. This approach ensures that the `clocs` parameter is always treated as a list, even if it is initially provided as a tuple.

By making this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
