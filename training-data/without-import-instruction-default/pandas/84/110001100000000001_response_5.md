1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack data based on multiple criteria. It first identifies the levels to be unstacked and then creates a dummy index to perform the unstacking. The problem seems to arise in the logic for unstacking and reorganizing the data.

2. The potential error location is in the section where it determines whether the data is a Series or not, and in the subsequent operations for unstacking and reorganizing the data based on the type of data.

3. The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of data based on whether it is a Series or not. This inconsistency affects the unstacking and reorganizing process, leading to incorrect output. The related function `unstack` is not directly related to the bug, as the issue seems to be localized within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Clearly defining the operations for handling Series and non-Series data separately.
   - Ensuring that the unstacking and reorganizing process is consistent and correct for both types of data.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        unstacked = result
        unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
