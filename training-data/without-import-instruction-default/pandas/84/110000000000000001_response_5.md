The potential error location within the problematic function is that it is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly. This leads to issues in unstacking the data and creating the new index.

The bug is caused by the improper handling of hierarchical columns, leading to errors in the unstacking process and the creation of the new index.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the hierarchical columns when unstacking the data and creating the new index. This may involve restructuring the code to correctly handle MultiIndex columns and properly unstacking the data.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        return unstacked
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked
```
