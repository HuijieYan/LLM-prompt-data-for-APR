The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a multi-level index DataFrame. The issue seems to be with the handling of multi-level indices and the way level numbers are being used.

The error message indicates that `_get_level_number` is trying to get the level number for a level name ("A", "a"), but it does not handle multi-level indices correctly, leading to ValueError or KeyError.

The potential cause of the bug is the inefficient handling of multi-level indices in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It fails to properly handle multi-level indices and level numbers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-level indices. The code should be updated to properly extract the level numbers and use them for unstacking the DataFrame.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    level_numbers = []
    
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_number = index.get_loc_level(loc, level=None)
            if level_number is None:
                level_number = index.get_loc_level(loc, level=0)
                if level_number is None:
                    raise KeyError(f"Level {loc} not found")
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
        else:
            level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    shape = [len(index.levels[i]) for i in level_numbers]
    group_index = get_group_index([index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers], xnull=False)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle both single-level and multi-level indices and pass the failing tests.
