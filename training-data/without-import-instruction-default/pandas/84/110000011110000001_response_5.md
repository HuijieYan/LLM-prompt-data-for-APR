1. The buggy function is a part of the Pandas library and is being tested by a failing test function from the test_reshape.py file. The error message indicates that there is an issue with getting the level number, which is related to the buggy function's implementation.

2. The potential error location within the function is the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line is attempting to extract level numbers from the index using the `_get_level_number` method.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_get_level_number` is not correctly identifying the level number. This causes the subsequent code to raise errors when trying to manipulate the multi-index data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include debugging the `_get_level_number` method to ensure it correctly identifies the level number and updating the logic for extracting level numbers from the index.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        if len(rlocs) == 0:
            unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            unstacked = data.unstack(level=rlocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By simplifying the function and using the existing unstack method in the correct way, it should now pass the failing test.
