The issue seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` function of the `MultiIndex` class, where it's not handling the correct lookup of the level with a tuple name.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should fix this issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (existing code)

    # Modify the clocs list into a list of tuples for multi-level indexing
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else list(clocs)

    # Obtain the level numbers for each cloc tuple in the clocs list
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    # ... (existing code)

    return unstacked
```

This change ensures that the clocs parameter is correctly processed as a list of tuples and then iterated over to obtain the level numbers. This should resolve the issue encountered in the failing tests.
