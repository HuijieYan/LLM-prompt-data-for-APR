Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the logic for unstacking the data when `isinstance(data, Series)` is `False`. The code appears to be trying to handle a multi-level index but is not handling it correctly.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by an incorrect implementation of unstacking the data when the input is not an instance of a Series. The code is not properly handling the multi-level index and is not setting the new columns and index correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the correct levels, codes, and names for the multi-level index.
2. Update the logic for unstacking the data when `isinstance(data, Series)` is `False` to handle the multi-level index properly.
3. Set the new columns and index correctly based on the multi-level index and unstacked data.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=unstacked.columns.codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
