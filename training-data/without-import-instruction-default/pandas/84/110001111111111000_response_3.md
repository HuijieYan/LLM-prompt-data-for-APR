# Buggy implementation
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` isn't handling multi-level indices correctly, leading to data being unstacked in an incorrect manner. The function is also trying to access non-existing levels, resulting in errors.

# Function rewrite
In the given function, there are several issues like incorrect handling of multi-level indices, incorrect unstacking logic, and level number index errors. 

Here is the rewritten function that addresses the issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Reconstruct the indices for the dummy dataframe
    new_level_values = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [range(len(index.levels[i])) for i in clocs]
    new_levels = [arr for arr in new_level_values]
    new_labels = [[l[k] for l in index.labels] for k, index in zip(clocs, new_level_values[-len(clocs):])]
    
    # Create a new MultiIndex with the reconstructed levels and labels
    dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_labels, names = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ['__placeholder__'] * len(clocs))
    
    # Create a new dataframe with the dummy index
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    
    # Unstack the dummy dataframe based on the placeholder levels
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(level=[-i-1 for i in range(len(clocs))], fill_value=fill_value)
    
    # Reconstruct the new levels and names for the resulting dataframe after unstacking
    new_levels = [level for i, level in enumerate(new_level_values) if i not in rlocs] + unstacked.columns.levels
    new_levels = [pd.Index(levels, name=name) for levels, name in zip(new_levels, index.names)]
    new_names = [index.names[i] for i in range(len(new_levels))]
    
    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays(unstacked.columns.labels, names=new_names)
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This function correctly handles the unstacking process for multi-level indices and reconstructs the resulting dataframe based on the unstacked levels. Additionally, it addresses the error handling for the level numbers.

This rewritten function should address the failing test cases and produce the expected results for the given scenarios.
