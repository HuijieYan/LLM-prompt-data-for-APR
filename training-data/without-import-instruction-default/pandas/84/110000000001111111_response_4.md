Looking at the buggy function and the information provided, it seems that the issue lies in the `_get_level_number` function where it fails to handle tuple names correctly. This is evident from the GitHub issue which demonstrates a KeyError when trying to unstack with tuple names.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be modified to handle tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Other code...

    # Replace this line
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Other code...

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function should now handle tuple names correctly and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
