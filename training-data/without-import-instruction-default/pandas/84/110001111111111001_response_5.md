The issue is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `index._get_level_number` method is being used. The actual value of `clocs` is incompatible with the expected behavior of `_get_level_number`.

The probable cause of the bug is that the input `clocs` variable is a tuple containing mixed types of values ("A", "a"), and 'B', and the function `_get_level_number` is only expecting level numbers. This results in a KeyError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` variable only contains level numbers. To achieve this, we will extract the level numbers from the input and use them in the `_get_level_number` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from the input clocs
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `clocs` variable only contains level numbers, which should resolve the KeyError issue and make the function compatible with the failing test cases.
