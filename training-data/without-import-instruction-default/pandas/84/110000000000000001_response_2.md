The buggy function seems to be designed to unstack multiple levels of a hierarchical index in a Pandas DataFrame or Series.

The potential error location in the function could be in the section where the function handles the case for when the input 'data' is not a Series but a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

The bug's cause could be that when 'data' is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns, the function does not properly handle the unstacking and constructing the new MultiIndex for the result.

To fix the bug, we can modify the section of the function that specifically deals with the case when 'data' is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        group_index = pd.factorize(ccodes[0])[0]
        comp_ids, obs_ids = pd.factorize(group_index)
        unstacked = pd.Series(ccodes[0], [obs_ids, comp_ids]).unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = [obs_ids]

    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
            unstacked = result
            new_levels = clevels + [result.index]
            new_names = cnames + [result.name]
            new_codes = ccodes + [comp_ids]

        else:
            unstacked = result
            new_levels = [result.columns.levels[0]] + clevels
            new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
            new_codes = [result.columns.codes[0]] + comp_ids.tolist()

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected code, we handle the unstacking for both Series and DataFrames with MultiIndex columns separately to ensure that the new MultiIndex is constructed correctly for the unstacked result. We also use the built-in Pandas functions such as `pd.factorize` and `pd.MultiIndex` to simplify the implementation.
