The issue with the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is that the use of `index._get_level_number(i)` is causing the ValueError. This error is raised because the level name is being directly passed to the `_get_level_number` function, which expects a level number instead.

The use of `clocs` and `rlocs` to determine the levels and codes for both columns and index and then to perform unstacking seems to be causing the issues as well.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct level number is being passed to the `_get_level_number` function. Additionally, the logic for determining the levels, codes, and unstacking needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas import Index, MultiIndex, Series
import pandas.core.reshape.api as r

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Correct the level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the series
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked

    # Unstack multi-index dataframe
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            result = result.unstack(clocs[i], fill_value=fill_value)
        return result
```

This corrected function now handles unstacking for both Series and DataFrame objects. We make use of the `unstack` method provided by Pandas, passing the correct level numbers based on the column or index structure, in place of using direct level names.

This should resolve the ValueError when unstacking multi-index objects, ensuring that the function passes the failing tests.
