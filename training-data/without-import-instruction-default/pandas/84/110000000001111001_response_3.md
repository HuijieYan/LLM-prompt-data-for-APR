The buggy function is intended to unstack a DataFrame based on the specified column levels. However, it fails to handle the MultiIndex columns properly in some cases, resulting in incorrect output.

The potential error is in the section that handles the unstacking of the input DataFrame when it contains MultiIndex columns. The code does not properly account for the hierarchical nature of the columns, leading to incorrect reshaping.

The bug's cause is that the code does not handle the MultiIndex columns correctly, leading to incorrect reshaping and restructuring of the column levels and names.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the case of MultiIndex columns. This can be achieved by correctly identifying the levels and codes of the MultiIndex columns, and then properly reconstructing the columns after unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        # Handling MultiIndex columns
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(clocs + rlocs)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(rcodes, names=rnames)

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the unstacking of both single and MultiIndex columns in the input DataFrame, producing the expected output for all test cases provided.
