1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is being used to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The GitHub issue "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" is related to the bug where converting a categorical series back into an integer column leads to NaN being converted to an incorrect negative integer value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the conversion of categorical data to integer data types. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where converting a categorical series back to an integer column results in unexpected negative integer values for NaN.

3. The bug's cause is the mishandling of NaN values when converting categorical data to integer data types. The `astype_nansafe` function in the provided code does not handle NaN values properly during the conversion, leading to unexpected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Reviewing the code logic related to the conversion of categorical data to integer data types to ensure proper handling of NaN values.
   (b) Updating the logic to explicitly handle NaN values appropriately during the conversion process.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function that addresses the bug and ensures the issues mentioned in the GitHub problem description are resolved:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    """
    
    # handle categorical data conversion
    if hasattr(arr, 'codes') and arr.dtype.name == 'category':
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            result = arr.copy().cat.codes
            result[arr.isna()] = np.nan
            return result
        elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
            result = arr.copy().cat.codes.astype(dtype)
            result[arr.isna()] = np.nan
            return result

    # handle other data types conversion
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

```

The corrected code explicitly handles the conversion of categorical data to integer or float data types by properly handling NaN values. It checks if the array is of type 'category' and then appropriately converts it to the specified dtype while preserving NaN values. This resolution addresses the issue described in the GitHub problem and provides a nan-safe manner for data type casting.
