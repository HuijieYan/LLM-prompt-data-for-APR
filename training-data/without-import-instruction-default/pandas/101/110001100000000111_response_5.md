The buggy function is `astype_nansafe` which is supposed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The issue seems to arise when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that is handling the conversion of categorical data to integers, as that seems to be the source of the issue raised in the GitHub report.

The bug's cause appears to be related to the handling of NaN values when converting categorical data to integers. This issue is related to the specific handling of NaNs in the `astype` function when the input data is of type 'category'. The reported issue also mentions an error when trying to use `astype('Int8')`, which suggests that the bug is related to the specific behavior of `astype` with categorical data containing NaNs.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to modify the section of the function that handles the conversion of categorical data to integers. Specifically, this may involve adjusting the logic for handling NaN values in this context. Additionally, the function should be modified to comply with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Updated logic to handle conversion of categorical data to integers
    if is_categorical(arr):
        if dtype == "Int8":
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy, errors='coerce')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we address the specific case of converting categorical data to integers. We use the `is_categorical` function to identify categorical data and then apply the appropriate logic for converting it to the specified dtype, considering the handling of NaNs. This should address the reported issue while also providing compatibility with other dtypes.
