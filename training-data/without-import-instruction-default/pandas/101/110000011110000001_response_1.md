The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` causes it to not raise a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integer values. This is evident from the failing test, `test_astype_nansafe`, which expects the function to raise a ValueError when trying to cast NaT to an integer type, but it does not.

The potential error location in the function is the block that checks for NaT values and tries to convert them to integer.

The bug is likely caused by the handling of NaT values in the function. The function should raise a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integer, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly handle the case where NaT values are being converted to integer types and raise a ValueError in that scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With the above correction, the `astype_nansafe` function will correctly raise a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to an integer type, and it will pass the failing test.
