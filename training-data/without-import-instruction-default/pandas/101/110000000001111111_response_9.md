The buggy function is intended to cast the elements of an array to a given data type in a nan-safe manner. However, there are some issues with the function.

The potential error location within the function is in the section that handles the conversion of datetime and timedelta types to int64. Here, there is a bug that causes incorrect casting of NaN values to integers.

Based on the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values, as well as the information in the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is that the function does not handle NaN values correctly when casting from categorical to integer data types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle NaN values properly when casting from categorical to integer types, ensuring that they are correctly converted to NaN in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if dtype == 'int':
            return arr.cat.codes.replace(-1, np.nan).astype(dtype)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code properly handles the casting from categorical to integer data types and ensures that NaN values are correctly converted to NaN in the output, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
