Potential bug location: The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function that is handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integers.

Bug Cause: The current implementation is not properly handling the conversion of NaT values to integers. This is causing the function to fail the test case where it should raise a ValueError indicating that it cannot convert NaT values to integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the input array contains NaT values and raise a ValueError accordingly.
2. Handle the conversion of NaT values to integers in a more explicit manner.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # (existing code...)

    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):  # Check if array contains NA or NaN values
        # Raise an error when NaT values are encountered
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # (remaining code...)

```

With this corrected implementation, the function should pass the failing test and raise a ValueError when encountered with NaT values, as expected.
