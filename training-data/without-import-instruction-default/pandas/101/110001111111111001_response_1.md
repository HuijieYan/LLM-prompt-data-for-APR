The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when converting to integer types. The failing test is checking for the correct behavior when attempting to convert NaT values to integers, but the function is currently not returning the expected error.

The error message indicates that the function did not raise a ValueError as expected when attempting to convert NaT values to integers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where NaT values are being converted to integer types. The current behavior of the function is likely not properly handling this case, which is leading to the failing test.

One approach to fixing the bug is to specifically check for NaT values and raise an error when attempting to convert them to integer types. This can be done by adding a conditional check for NaT values and raising a ValueError if they are encountered.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # check for NaT values when converting to integer types
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # remaining code for dtype conversion
    # ...
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types and raise a ValueError as expected in the failing test. This approach satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
