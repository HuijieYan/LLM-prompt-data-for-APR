1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is meant to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The GitHub issue is related to converting a categorical series back into an integer column, where NaNs are incorrectly converted to negative integer values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the condition concerning NaN handling when converting from a categorical series to an integer dtype: `arr.astype(int)`.

3. The bug's cause is related to how NaNs are handled when converting categorical series to integer dtype, leading to unexpected negative integer values. This is reflected in the GitHub issue where the user expects NaN in a category to convert to NaN in IntX (nullable integer) or float, but instead receives unexpected negative integer values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adjusting the NaN handling within the function to ensure that NaNs from categorical series are appropriately handled when converting to integer dtype. This may involve considering the category-specific handling of NaNs and ensuring that they are assigned NaN values in the integer dtype.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function that attempts to address the bug based on the GitHub issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    # Correct handling for categorical dtype
    if is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
        if isna(arr).any():
            return arr.astype('Int64') if is_integer_dtype(dtype) else arr.astype(dtype)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, the handling for categorical dtype has been specifically addressed. If NaNs are present in the array and the dtype is integer, it converts the array to 'Int64' to handle the NaNs as nullable integers. Otherwise, it converts the array to the specified dtype. This should resolve the issue with categorical series being incorrectly converted to negative integer values.
