The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` values and their conversion to integer types. The failing test is expecting the function to raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", but the function is failing to do so.

The issue seems to be with the handling of NaT values when converting to integer types. The function should raise the ValueError as expected when trying to convert NaT values to integers, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for NaT values when converting to integer types and raise a ValueError in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # existing code
```

With this change, the function will properly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types and will raise a ValueError when necessary. This should address the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
