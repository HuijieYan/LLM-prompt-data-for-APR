1. The buggy function is supposed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The related function called within the buggy function is `astype_nansafe` from the same file `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py`. The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" is related to the behavior when converting a categorical series to an integer column, where NaN values are converted to incorrect integer negative values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section related to the conversion of categorical series back into an integer column and how it handles NaN values.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not handling the conversion from categorical series to integer column correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when NaN values are present.
   (b). The related function `astype_nansafe` may not be correctly handling the conversion of categorical series to integer column and how it deals with NaN values.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides specific examples and the unexpected output when converting a categorical series with NaN values to an integer series, making it clear that the issue is related to the conversion logic for NaN values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Ensure that the conversion logic for categorical series to integer column properly handles NaN values, converting them to NaN in the resulting integer column.
   (b). Review and update the related function `astype_nansafe` to handle categorical to integer conversion correctly, especially with regards to NaN values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # updated logic for handling conversion of categorical series to integer column
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype('Int64')  # Convert to nullable integer type

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # .....
```

The corrected code includes an updated logic to handle the conversion of categorical series to an integer column, ensuring that NaN values are handled correctly. This is in line with the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
