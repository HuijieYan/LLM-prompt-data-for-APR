The bug appears to stem from the function `astype_nansafe` not handling the conversion of NaN values to integer types correctly.

The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is testing the conversion of NaN values to an integer type, but the function `astype_nansafe` is not raising the expected ValueError, leading to test failure.

This issue is also reported on GitHub, where it is mentioned that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, NaN is incorrectly converted to a large negative integer value.

The bug likely originates from the section of code that handles the conversion of NaN values to integer types. The function does not handle this conversion correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be modified to handle NaN values correctly when converting to an integer type. This could involve implementing a check for NaN values before the conversion and raising a ValueError if NaN values are encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    (Add a description of the function's parameters and behavior)
    """
    # Updated code to handle NaN values when converting to integer type
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This updated version of the `astype_nansafe` function includes a check for NaN values before the conversion to an integer type, and it raises a ValueError if NaN values are encountered. This change should address the issue and ensure that the function handles NaN values correctly.

The updated function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the conversion of categorical NaN values to integer types.
