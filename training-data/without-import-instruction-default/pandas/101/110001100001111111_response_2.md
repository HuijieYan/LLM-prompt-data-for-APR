The issue seems to be related to how Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs are cast to an integer dtype, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. It appears that the bug is causing unexpected behavior when categorical series are converted back into an integer column, resulting in NaN being incorrectly converted to a large negative integer value.

The root cause of the bug may be related to the dtype conversion process within the `astype_nansafe` function. The function seems to handle various dtype conversions, including handling datetime and timedelta dtype, but there may be a specific issue related to the conversion of categorical dtype to integer dtype.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if the dtype being converted is a categorical dtype and handle the conversion appropriately, ensuring that NaN values are treated correctly during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype or str
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if isinstance(dtype, str) and dtype == 'int':
        if pd.api.types.is_categorical(arr):
            return pd.Series(arr).astype('Int64').array
        else:
            return arr.astype('Int64')

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected code, I first check if the `dtype` is a string and specifically 'int'. If so, I then check if the input `arr` is a categorical dtype using `pd.api.types.is_categorical`. If it is, I convert the series to 'Int64' type to handle the NaN conversion correctly. Otherwise, I proceed with the default dtype conversion.

This corrected code should now handle the conversion of categorical dtype to integer dtype in a more precise and reliable manner, ensuring that NaN values are treated correctly. Additionally, it should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
