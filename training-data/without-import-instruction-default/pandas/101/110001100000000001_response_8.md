1. The buggy function astype_nansafe is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It also calls other related functions such as is_extension_array_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype, is_object_dtype, and lib.astype_str.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the code that checks whether the dtype is a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype but has no unit, as this may result in a ValueError being raised.

3. The cause of the bug may be due to incorrect handling of datetimes and timedeltas without units, leading to a ValueError being raised. This is evident from the code that checks if the dtype is a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype but has no unit and raises a ValueError if that is the case. Additionally, the way dtype is handled and converted to the appropriate type could also lead to potential errors.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to handle datetime64 and timedelta64 dtypes without units by providing an appropriate unit and to ensure that the dtype is handled and converted correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if not dtype.name.endswith("[ns]"):

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
