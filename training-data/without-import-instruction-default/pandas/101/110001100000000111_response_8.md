1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is astype_nansafe, which is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
   - The related function astype_nansafe is called within the buggy function and is involved in the conversion process.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The bug seems to be related to the conversion of categorical series back into an Int column, where NaN values are incorrectly converted to integer negative values.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The buggy function astype_nansafe does not handle the conversion of NaN values from categorical to integer dtype correctly.
   (b). The related function involved in the conversion process may not handle NaN values appropriately.
   (c). The GitHub issue details how the conversion from categorical to int ignores NaNs, and the expected behavior is that NaN in category converts to NaN in the integer data type.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the conversion logic within the astype_nansafe function to handle NaN values appropriately when converting from categorical to integer data type.
   - Ensure that the related function involved in the conversion process correctly handles NaN values during the conversion.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
# Fixes the bug related to converting categorical NaN to int

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if isinstance(dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype):
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            return arr.astype('Int64')
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

```

This corrected code addresses the issue of converting categorical NaN to int by explicitly checking if the dtype is a CategoricalDtype and then handling the NaN values appropriately. This code resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue by handling the conversion in a nan-safe manner and ensuring that NaN in category converts to NaN in the integer data type.
