The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, the function has a bug related to converting categorical NaNs to integers, which causes unexpected behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The issue is caused by the mishandling of NaNs when converting categorical data to integer dtype. This causes NaNs to be converted to incorrect integer values. The bug is related to the handling of categorical data during dtype conversion.

To fix the bug, the function needs to have a special case for converting categorical data to integer dtype, ensuring that NaNs are correctly handled and converted to NaN values in the integer dtype.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to include a special case for handling categorical data. When converting from categorical to integer dtype, NaNs should be correctly handled to ensure that they are converted to NaN values in the integer dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Existing code...

    if arr.dtype.name in ['category', 'category[int64]']:
        if dtype == 'Int64':
            return arr.astype('Int64', copy=copy)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # Existing code...
```

By adding a special case for handling categorical data, the corrected `astype_nansafe` function ensures that NaNs are correctly handled when converting categorical data to integer dtype, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

With this correction, the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug.
