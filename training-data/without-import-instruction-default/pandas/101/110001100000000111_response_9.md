1. The buggy function is an astype_nansafe function in the cast.py file of the pandas library. The function is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function checks for extension array types, datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, and performs various casts based on the dtype input.

The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" indicates that there is an error when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The issue description also mentions that when converting categorical series back into an Int column, it converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the conversion of NaNs in categorical data to integer dtype. It seems that the function does not handle the conversion of NaNs in categorical data to integer values correctly, which results in unexpected negative integer representations.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using the provided information:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the conversion of NaNs in categorical data to integer dtype correctly.
   (b). The related function astype_nansafe is responsible for performing nan-safe casting of array elements based on the dtype input.
   (c). The GitHub issue information highlights the problem where the conversion of categorical data with NaN values to integer dtype results in unexpected negative integer representations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding specific handling for NaN values in categorical data when casting to integer dtype.
   - Ensuring that the conversion from categorical data to integer dtype preserves NaN values appropriately.
   - Implementing checks and conversions for handling NaN values in categorical data during the casting process.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Existing code for handling extension array dtype, datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, and other dtype checks.

    # Handling conversion of categorical values to integer dtype
    if isinstance(arr, Categorical):
        if skipna:
            arr = arr.fillna(np.NaN)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert categorical values with NaNs to integer dtype without skipping NaNs")

    # Existing code for handling specific dtype conversions

    # Return the casted array
    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected code, a specific check has been added to handle categorical values when converting to an integer dtype. The function now checks if the input array is a Categorical type and handles NaN values accordingly. If skipna is False, an error is raised to indicate that categorical values with NaNs cannot be converted to an integer dtype without skipping NaNs.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by handling the conversion of categorical data to integer dtype in a nan-safe manner.
