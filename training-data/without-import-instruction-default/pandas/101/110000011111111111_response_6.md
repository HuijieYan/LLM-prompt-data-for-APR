The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function has several conditional blocks to handle different data types and conditions for casting.

Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that there is an issue with casting NaN values to integer types for datetime and timedelta arrays. The failing test is expecting a ValueError to be raised when attempting to convert NaT values to integer, but the function does not raise the expected error.

Upon review, the issue appears to be in the conditional blocks for handling datetime and timedelta data types. The logic for handling NaN values and casting to integer type seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks for datetime and timedelta data types need to be modified to handle NaN values properly when casting to integer types.

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.datetime64):
        if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to datetime")
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.timedelta64):
        if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to timedelta")
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

# The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this corrected logic, the function will properly handle NaN values when casting datetime and timedelta arrays to integer types, which should resolve the failing test and the reported issue in the GitHub post.
