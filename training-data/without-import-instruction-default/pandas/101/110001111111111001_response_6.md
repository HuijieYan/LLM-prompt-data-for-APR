The issue in the buggy function seems to be with the casting of NaT values to integer types. The failing test expects the function to raise a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to integers, but the function is not raising the error as expected.

The bug appears to be related to the check for NaT values. The function needs to correctly handle NaT values and raise a ValueError when attempting to convert them to integers.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to explicitly check for NaT values and raise a ValueError when trying to convert them to integer types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for NaT values in the input array and raises a ValueError if the dtype is an integer type. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
