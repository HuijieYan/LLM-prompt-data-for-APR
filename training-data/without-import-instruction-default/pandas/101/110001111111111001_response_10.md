The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is causing the test to fail to raise a `ValueError` when it should.

Upon analyzing the function and the failing test, it is evident that the bug is likely to be in the part of the function that deals with converting `NaT` values to integers. This is indicated by the error message in the failing test, which mentions "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

The bug is likely caused due to improper handling of `NaT` values when converting to integers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers. This can be achieved by checking for `NaT` values and raising a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" when encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if np.isnat(arr.item()):  # Check if the value is NaT
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

This corrected code ensures that when the input array contains `NaT` values and the target dtype is an integer, a `ValueError` is raised with the appropriate message. This satisfies the expected input/output variable information and will cause the failing test to pass.
