The bug seems to be related to converting categorical data with NaNs to an integer type. The failing test is attempting to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer, which is currently resulting in a ValueError.

The issue appears to be related to handling NaN values during the type conversion, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The code fails to handle NaN values properly when converting a categorical series back into an integer column. This results in unexpected negative integer values instead of NaN.

To fix the bug, one approach is to update the `astype_nansafe` function to properly handle NaN values when converting categorical data to an integer type. The correction should also address the issue mentioned in the GitHub issue by ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.api.types as ptypes

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if ptypes.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            if not ptypes.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
                return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            else:
                return arr.fillna(pd.NA).astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # handle other data types
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function will now correctly handle the conversion of NaN values in categorical data to an integer type. This should address the failing test and the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

The corrected code ensures that when converting categorical data to an integer type, NaN values are properly handled and converted to appropriate NaN representations in the integer type.
