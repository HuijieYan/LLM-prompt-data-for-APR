The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given data type in a nan-safe manner. However, the function is failing in the provided test cases when attempting to convert NaN values to integer types. This issue is also reported in a GitHub issue.

Upon analysis, it is evident that the bug is caused by the inability of the function to handle NaN values when converting to integer types.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle NaN values appropriately when converting to integer types.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if dtype == np.int64 or dtype == np.float64:
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            return np.full(arr.shape, np.nan, dtype=dtype)
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

```

The corrected function addresses the issue by checking if the input array contains NaN values when converting to integer or float types. If NaN values are present, it returns a new array with NaN values of the specified dtype. The function also uses the `isna()` function from the `pandas` module to check for NaN values.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report by handling NaN values appropriately when converting to integer types.
