The issue stems from the code attempting to convert NaN values to an integer. This causes an error that prevents the code from passing the failing test.

The bug's cause can be identified by looking at the failing test, which expects the function to raise a ValueError when attempting to convert NaN values to an integer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle NaN values appropriately when converting to integer types, and raise a ValueError if such a conversion is attempted.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    """

    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            if any(pd.isna(arr)):
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue on GitHub.
