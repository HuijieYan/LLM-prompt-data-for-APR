1. The astype_nansafe function attempts to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It handles different data types including strings, datetime64, timedelta64, and integers.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the block that handles the case when the dtype is a datetime64 or timedelta64. There are multiple conditional statements and checks being performed which can lead to potential bugs.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling all cases and combinations of array types and dtypes correctly. There are multiple conditional statements and error handling that can result in unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include refactoring the function to use simpler conditional statements and error handling, properly handling different combinations of array types and dtypes, and ensuring that all edge cases are correctly handled.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if pd.api.types.is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return pd.api.types.construct_array_type(dtype)._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
    
    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.str_):
        return pd.core.algorithms.astype_object(arr, copy=copy)

    elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.datetime64):
        return pd.to_datetime(arr, errors='coerce').astype(dtype)

    elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.timedelta64):
        return pd.to_timedelta(arr, errors='coerce').astype(dtype)

    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected code, the function is simplified and uses numpy and pandas functions to handle the different array types and dtypes. It uses the issubdtype function to check the data type of the array and dtype, and then applies the appropriate conversion if needed. The error handling is also simplified and consistent throughout the function.
