Based on the source code of the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of NaN values when casting to integer types. The failing test specifically states "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", indicating that there is an issue with converting NaN values to integer types.

This issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where the user provides a code sample showing that converting a categorical series back to an integer column results in NaN being converted to an unexpected negative integer value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section that handles the conversion of NaN values to integer types.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that NaN values are properly handled when casting to integer types. It may involve adding a check for NaN values and handling them appropriately, such as converting them to NaN in the target integer dtype.

Here's the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # handle NaN values when casting to integer types
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isnan(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With the corrected function, the NaN values will be properly handled when casting to integer types, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
