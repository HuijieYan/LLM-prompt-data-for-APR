1. The buggy function is `astype_nansafe` which is used to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The relationship with the GitHub issue is that the function is raising an error when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing nans to an integer dtype. This aligns with the issue title "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" on GitHub.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the function checks if the array contains NaN values and attempts to cast them to int.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling NaN values correctly when casting a Categorical column to an integer dtype, leading to unexpected negative integer values for NaN.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding explicit checks for NaN values and handling them appropriately when casting to an integer dtype.
   - Modifying the behavior of the function to ensure that NaN values are preserved when casting Categorical columns to integer dtype.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if hasattr(arr, 'categories'):
        if pd.isna(arr.categories).any():
            dtype = object

    if 'Int' in str(dtype):
        if hasattr(arr, 'categories'):
            arr = arr.astype('category')

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

# Test the corrected function
s = pd.Series([1, 0, None], dtype='category')
s = astype_nansafe(s, 'int')
print(s)
```

The corrected function checks if the input array is a Categorical column and if it contains NaN values. If the input array is a Categorical column with NaN values, it changes the data type to object. Then it proceeds to cast the elements to the given dtype while handling NaN values appropriately. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub about casting categorical NaN to int.
