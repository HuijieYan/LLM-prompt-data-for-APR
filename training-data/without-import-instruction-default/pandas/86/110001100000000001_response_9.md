1. The buggy function is a part of the pivot.py file in the pandas library. This function is used to pivot a DataFrame based on the given index, columns, and values. The function also makes use of other related functions such as set_index, MultiIndex.from_arrays, and unstack to perform its operations.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the conditional statements for handling the 'values' parameter. It seems that the function is not appropriately handling the case when 'values' is not None, and there are list-like values that are not tuples.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the different cases for the 'values' parameter. When 'values' is not None, the function should construct the indexed DataFrame based on the specified index, columns, and values. However, the current implementation is not handling this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

4. To fix the bug, the function should first check if 'values' is not None. If it is not None, then it should construct the indexed DataFrame based on the given values. Additionally, the function should also handle the case when 'values' is a list-like object and not a tuple, as this is currently causing the bug.

5. Here's the corrected code for the pivot function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns, fill_value=None)
```

In the corrected code, I've added a check for whether 'values' is a list-like object and not a tuple. This ensures that the function correctly constructs the indexed DataFrame based on the given values. Additionally, I've also added a fill_value=None parameter to the unstack method to handle any potential NaN values that may arise during the pivot operation.
