1. The buggy function is a pandas.DataFrame.pivot method. The failing test is trying to pivot a DataFrame with columns=None, which should raise a TypeError with the message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'". However, the error message raised is confusing and does not clearly indicate that 'columns' is a required argument. The GitHub issue has identified this discrepancy and is requesting the error message to be improved.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional checks for 'values' and 'index'. It seems that the error message is not being raised properly when 'columns' is None, and the function does not recognize that 'columns' is a required argument.

3. (a). The problematic function is trying to handle the case when 'columns' is None, but it's not handling it properly.
   (b). The failing test code is trying to pivot a DataFrame with columns=None, and the error message raised is not clear and is confusing.
   (c). The GitHub issue has correctly pointed out the discrepancy between the docstring and the actual error message raised when 'columns' is None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Improve the conditional checks in the 'pivot' function to properly handle the case when 'columns' is None.
   - Modify the error message to clearly indicate that 'columns' is a required argument.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def pivot(data, index=None, columns=None, values=None):
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
        
        if isinstance(values, str):
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index, columns=[values])
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass and the error message will clearly indicate that 'columns' is a required argument. The GitHub issue is also resolved with this fix.
