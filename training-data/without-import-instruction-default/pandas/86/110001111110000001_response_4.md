The error occurs in the pivot function of the pandas library. The error message indicates that there is a KeyError: None when trying to get_loc during the execution of the test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error test. This is likely due to the fact that the 'columns' parameter is not being properly handled when it is set to None.

The issue in the code is in the pivot function, specifically in the block where the 'columns' parameter is checked. When 'columns' is None and 'index' is also None, the code attempts to create a MultiIndex from 'index' and data['columns'], which throws an error.

To fix this issue, a check should be added in the if block for the case where 'columns' is None and 'index' is also None. If this is the case, an error should be raised to indicate that both 'index' and 'columns' cannot be None at the same time.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None and columns is None:
            raise ValueError("Both 'index' and 'columns' cannot be None")
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

This corrected code includes a check to raise an error if both 'index' and 'columns' are None. This will avoid the KeyError that was being encountered during the test.
