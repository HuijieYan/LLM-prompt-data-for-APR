Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be with the `pivot` function in the pandas package. The failing test `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` indicates that when `columns` is set to `None`, the error message is misleading. Instead of indicating that 'columns' is a required argument, a KeyError is raised for 'None'. The corresponding GitHub issue also highlights this discrepancy.

The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the case when `columns` is set to `None` properly, resulting in the KeyError. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, as well as the GitHub issue which points out the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior.

To fix this bug, the `pivot` function should be modified to handle the case when `columns` is set to `None` and raise a clear error message indicating that 'columns' is a required argument in this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot` function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected code, the `pivot` function should now raise a clear TypeError when `columns` is set to `None`, as indicated in the failing test. This resolves the issue highlighted in the GitHub report as well.
