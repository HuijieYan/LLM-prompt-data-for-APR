The problematic function is pivot, which is located in pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py. The failing test is located in pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is missing a required argument 'columns'. This means that the function is not handling the case where the 'columns' parameter is None properly.

The potential error is likely in the section of code where the 'columns' parameter is being processed. The code does not handle the case where 'columns' is None.

The buggy function is not handling the case where 'columns' is None properly, which is leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if 'columns' is None, and handle this case appropriately. If 'columns' is None, then we need to set it to an empty string or a default value, and then proceed with the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        columns = ''  # set it to an empty string or a default value
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where 'columns' is None without causing a KeyError, and should pass the failing test.
