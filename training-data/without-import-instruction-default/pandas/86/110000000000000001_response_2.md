1. The buggy function appears to be a pivot function that takes a DataFrame and pivots it based on the specified index, columns, and values.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the section where it handles the condition when values is not None. There are multiple conditional checks and manipulations of the index and values which could lead to a potential error.

3. The cause of the bug can be related to incorrect handling of the conditions and manipulations of the index and values, leading to unexpected behavior or output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include simplifying the conditional logic, ensuring proper handling of index and values, and thoroughly testing the function to identify and fix any other potential issues.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, is_list_like

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data.loc[:, [values]].set_index(index, append=True).unstack()
        else:
            indexed = data.loc[:, values].set_index(index).unstack()
    
    return indexed
```
In the corrected code, the conditional logic has been simplified and the usage of pivot function has been introduced for the case when values is None, which should improve the functionality and readability of the code.
