1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library, specifically in the pivot.py file. It is intended to pivot a DataFrame, but there are issues in the logic that lead to errors.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check for the presence of values and index.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional statements not handling all possible combinations of input parameters. For example, when values is None, the code sets the index but does not handle the case where index is also None. Similarly, when values is not None, the code does not handle the case where index is None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding additional conditional statements to handle all combinations of input parameters
   - Restructuring the code to have separate logic for when values is None and when it is not
   - Ensuring that the index, columns, and values are properly handled in all scenarios

5. Corrected code:
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        index_cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(index_cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if isinstance(values, str):
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)
        else:
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)

    return indexed
```

In the corrected code, I have made the following changes:
- Changed the conditional statements and logic to handle all combinations of input parameters
- Revised the use of values to ensure that it is properly handled
- Simplified the code by removing unnecessary checks and using a more straightforward approach to pivoting the DataFrame
