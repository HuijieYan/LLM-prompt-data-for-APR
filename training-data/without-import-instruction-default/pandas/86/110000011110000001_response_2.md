The buggy function is a `pivot` function that is supposed to pivot a DataFrame based on the specified index, columns, and values. However, the failing test `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` is failing with a KeyError: None. The test is trying to pivot a DataFrame by setting the index to "col1" and using "col3" as the values, without specifying any columns. The error message indicates that the issue is with finding the location of the key, and it points to the line `index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])`.

The potential error location is that when `columns` is not specified, it is assumed to be None, which is leading to the KeyError. The function does not handle the case where `columns` is not provided.

The bug is caused by the function not handling the case where `columns` is not specified properly. This leads to a KeyError when trying to perform the pivot operation.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `columns` is None, and if so, create a default list of columns for the pivot operation. Additionally, the function should also check if `index` is None and set it to the DataFrame's index in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot` function:

```python
from typing import Union
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
from pandas.core.algorithms import is_list_like

# This is the corrected version of the function
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        columns = [col for col in data.columns if col not in (index, values)]
    
    if index is None:
        index = data.index

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        index_values = MultiIndex.from_arrays([data[index], data[columns]])
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index_values, columns=values)
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index_values)
    
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected function now handles the case where `columns` is None. It creates a default list of columns by excluding the index and values columns. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
