1. The given function is a part of the pandas library and is meant to pivot a DataFrame. It takes in a DataFrame as input and then pivots the data based on the specified index, columns, and values.

2. The potential error location in the given function is the handling of the 'values' parameter. The function has conditional statements to handle scenarios where 'values' is None and where it is not None.

3. The bug in the given function may be caused by the conditional statements not correctly handling all possible scenarios for the 'values' parameter. This could lead to unexpected behavior when pivoting the DataFrame. Additionally, the MultiIndex.from_arrays() function might not be used correctly, resulting in incorrect indexing.

4. To fix the bug, the function can be revised to properly handle the 'values' parameter and its various scenarios. Additionally, the creation of the MultiIndex should be reviewed to ensure it is correctly generated based on the input parameters.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is not None:
            index = data[index]
        index = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)):
            indexed = data.loc[:, values].copy()
            indexed.index = index
            indexed.columns = values
        else:
            indexed = data.loc[:, values].copy()
            indexed.index = index

    return indexed.loc[:, ~indexed.columns.duplicated()].unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements for handling the 'values' parameter have been revised to handle all possible scenarios. The creation of the MultiIndex has also been adjusted to ensure proper indexing based on the input parameters. Additionally, the code has been updated to make use of the Pandas library functions for better data manipulation.
