1. The pivot function in the pandas library is used to reshape a DataFrame and the issue on GitHub describes a scenario where the error message raised when columns=None in df.pivot is confusing. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the "columns" parameter in the pivot function.

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the conditional statement that checks if "values" is None and then proceeds to set the index based on the "index" and "columns" parameters. This logic seems to be causing the issue when "columns" is passed as None.

3. (a). The buggy function contains conditional statements to handle different cases when setting the index or constructing the DataFrame based on the input parameters. The issue seems to arise from the handling of the "columns" parameter when it is None.
   (b). The related functions include the usage of MultiIndex and the construction of the DataFrame using the data and index parameters.
   (c). The GitHub issue information highlights that the error message when "columns" is passed as None is confusing, and it should explicitly state that "columns" is not optional.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to include explicit checks for the "columns" parameter to ensure it is not None, and raise a clear error message if it is. Additionally, the logic for setting the index and constructing the DataFrame based on the input parameters may need to be adjusted to handle the case where "columns" is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise ValueError("The 'columns' parameter in df.pivot is not optional")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for the "columns" parameter at the beginning of the function, and if it is None, a ValueError is raised with a clear message. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug. Additionally, the remaining logic for setting the index and constructing the DataFrame remains the same.
