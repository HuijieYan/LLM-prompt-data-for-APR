The buggy function is the pivot function within the file pivot.py, which is a part of the pandas library. The failing test "test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error" is designed to test that the pivot function correctly raises a TypeError when the 'columns' argument is not provided.

The error message indicates that the KeyError occurs within the get_loc method of the IndexEngine class, which is called by the pivot function when 'columns' is None. This suggests that the error is related to how the function is handling the 'columns' argument.

The bug is caused by the pivot function not handling the case where 'columns' is None correctly. When 'columns' is None, the function should raise a TypeError as specified in the test, but the current implementation leads to a KeyError. This is likely due to attempting to access the 'columns' as if it were a valid index. 

To fix this bug, the pivot function should first check if the 'columns' argument is None and raise a TypeError if it is. If 'columns' is not None, the function should proceed with the normal pivot operation.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected code, the pivot function will now raise a TypeError when 'columns' is None, as expected by the failing test, and will thus pass the test. This should address the bug identified in the original function and enable it to perform as intended.
