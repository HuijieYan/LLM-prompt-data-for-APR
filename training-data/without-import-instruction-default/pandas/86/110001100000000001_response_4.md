1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used for pivoting data within a DataFrame. It takes input arguments for index, columns, and values and returns a pivoted DataFrame. The function uses the set_index() method to rearrange the DataFrame and then unstacks the pivoted columns.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the 'values' argument. The function checks if 'values' is None and then appends 'index' and 'columns' to the DataFrame. If 'values' is not None, it constructs a MultiIndex from 'index' and 'columns', and then creates a new DataFrame using the values. There could be an error in how 'values' is processed in these conditional statements.

3. The bug's cause could be related to how the 'values' argument is handled in the function. If 'values' is None, the function sets the index and append parameters incorrectly. Additionally, the construction of the MultiIndex and the creation of the new DataFrame using 'values' may not be handled properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adjusting the conditional statements related to the 'values' argument to ensure that the correct behavior is executed based on its value.
   - Reviewing the construction of the MultiIndex and the creation of the new DataFrame using 'values' to ensure that it is handled correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns)
    else:
        indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)
    return indexed
```

In the corrected code, the function uses the pivot() method directly to pivot the DataFrame based on the input arguments. If 'values' is None, the function uses pivot() with only 'index' and 'columns'. If 'values' is not None, the function includes 'values' as well. This simplifies the function and ensures that the pivoting behavior is consistent.
