The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` and the related functions are `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`. The failing test is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the error message is related to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling the `groupby` method in the failing test. This error occurs when attempting to infer daylight saving time (DST) from a specific date and time.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, and the subsequent adjustment and comparison of `binner` and `labels`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of daylight saving time (DST) when calculating the `binner` and `labels`. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised when trying to infer the DST time.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for creating the `binner` and `labels` and handle DST appropriately. One possible approach is to use the `tz_localize` method to localize the `first` and `last` dates to the timezone of the input `ax`, as well as when creating the `binner` and `labels`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min().tz_localize(ax.tz), ax.max().tz_localize(ax.tz)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=(self.closed == "right"))

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code adjusts the creation of `binner` and `labels` by localizing the `first` and `last` dates to the timezone of the input `ax` and handles the potential DST ambiguity. This modification should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test.
