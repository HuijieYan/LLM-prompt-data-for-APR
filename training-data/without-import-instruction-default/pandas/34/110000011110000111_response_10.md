The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` through the error message received. The error message indicates that there is an issue with ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. This is most likely related to the handling of time zones and daylight saving time in the `_get_time_bins` function.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the `date_range` function where the time zone is being handled. This is further confirmed by the error message indicating an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The cause of the bug is related to the way the time zones are handled in the `date_range` function, leading to an ambiguous time error.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day properly. This can be done by adjusting the way time zones and daylight saving time are handled, ensuring that the time is not ambiguous.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values,
        bin_edges,
        self.closed,
        hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected code, the function should now handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day properly and pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
