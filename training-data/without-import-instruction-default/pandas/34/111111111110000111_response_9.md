The buggy function is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is called `_get_time_bins` and it is responsible for grouping time intervals. The failing test function is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` from `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a clock change in Cuba.

The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely related to the calculation of bin edges and labels for time intervals, especially around the time of the clock change. The code appears to be handling time intervals incorrectly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The cause of the bug could be due to how the function handles the transition from standard time to daylight saving time (DST) on the day of the clock change. It seems like the function does not properly account for ambiguous time stamps during this transition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Incorporating logic to handle ambiguous time stamps during the transition to DST, especially at midnight on the day of the clock change in the specified timezone.
- Ensuring that the function generates bin edges and labels correctly taking into account the ambiguous time stamps.
- Addressing the time zone conversion and localization to handle ambiguous times properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Properly handle ambiguous time stamps during the transition to DST
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

By incorporating proper handling of ambiguous time stamps during the transition to DST and ensuring correct generation of bin edges and labels, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. This revised code should pass the failing test and successfully handle the AmbiguousTimeError on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
