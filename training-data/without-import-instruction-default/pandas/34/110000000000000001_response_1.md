1. The _get_time_bins function is designed to generate time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex. It performs various checks and computations to return the bins and labels.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the calculation of the bins and labels, as well as the adjustment of the labels if there are more labels than bins.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the bins and labels, leading to discrepancies in the returned values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Reworking the logic for calculating the bins and labels to ensure accuracy and proper adjustment.
   b. Checking for any edge cases or special conditions that may affect the calculation of bins and labels and addressing them in the function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.datetimes.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=None, end=None, periods=0, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
- The DatetimeIndex class is imported from pd.core.indexes.datetimes.
- The date_range function is used to create binner and labels with appropriate parameters.
- The logic for adjusting labels is updated based on the conditions.
- The use of NaT is corrected from NaT to pd.NaT.
