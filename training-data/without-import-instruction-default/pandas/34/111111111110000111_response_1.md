The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is called within the `TimeGrouper` class to create time bins for the input axis. The error message "AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times" indicates that the function is unable to handle ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in certain timezones such as Cuba.

The root cause of the bug lies in the `_get_time_bins` function, which fails to handle ambiguous timestamps during the conversion of timezones. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when creating daily frequency groups that include ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the `_adjust_bin_edges` and `date_range` functions need to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively. Additionally, the `_get_time_bins` function should be updated to address the specific issue related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, such as the one observed in the failing test.

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the grouping process accounts for timezones with ambiguous times, such as those affected by daylight saving time changes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Trim labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle ambiguous timestamps and correctly create time bins for the input axis, addressing the specific issue outlined in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
