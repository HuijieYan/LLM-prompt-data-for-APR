The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class seems to be generating incorrect bin boundaries when the time crosses a Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition. This is evident from the failing test which encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` while trying to get the bin values.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect calculation of `first` and `last` variables within the `_get_time_bins` function, which is used to calculate the bin boundaries. When the time crosses a DST transition, the generation of bins might not correctly handle the time boundary, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

One approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the calculation of `first` and `last` variables take into account the DST transitions and correctly generate the bin boundaries. This can be achieved by using the `asof` method to obtain the business day prior to the last timestamp, and then calculate the range between the first and last timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.asof(ax.min() - self.freq)
    last = ax.asof(ax.max())
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name, 
        ambiguous="infer", 
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code takes into account the potential DST transitions and should now correctly generate the bin boundaries, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered in the failing test.
