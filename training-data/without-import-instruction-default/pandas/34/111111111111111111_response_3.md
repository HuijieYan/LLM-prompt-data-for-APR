The problem causing the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` is likely to be due to the code not handling the ambiguous time during the clock change day properly. The issue is occurring when the `pd.Grouper` is used to group the data based on daily frequency, and the clock change occurs within the grouped data.

The bug appears to be in the function `_get_time_bins` of the class `TimeGrouper` from the file `resample.py`. The function does not properly handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, causing ambiguous time errors.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` should be modified to properly handle the transition in time during the clock change. Additionally, it should ensure that the binning process is done correctly, taking into account the boundaries affected by daylight saving time changes.

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to explicitly handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, ensuring that the correct time labels and bins are generated.

Here's the corrected code for the `TimeGrouper` class's `_get_time_bins` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(None)
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(None) + to_offset(self.freq)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed, ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time correctly, ensuring that the bins and labels are generated accurately.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` no longer raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
