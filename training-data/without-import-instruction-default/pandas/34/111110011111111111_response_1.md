The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the handling of timestamps on clock-change days. When the AmbiguousTimeError is raised, the function does not handle it appropriately, leading to incorrect binning.

The cause of the bug is the failure to account for the ambiguous nature of timestamps on clock-change days, such as the one occurring in Cuba. The input timestamps in the failing test fall within this ambiguous period due to the time change, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should properly handle the ambiguous timestamps to ensure correct binning and grouping. This can be achieved by adjusting the bin edges and labels for the ambiguous timestamps.

To resolve the issue, the `_get_time_bins` function can be modified to handle the ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days appropriately. This can be done by checking for ambiguous timestamps and adjusting the bins and labels accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._utc_transition_times:
        ax = ax.tz_convert("UTC")
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

By handling the ambiguous timestamps and ensuring correct binning and labeling, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
