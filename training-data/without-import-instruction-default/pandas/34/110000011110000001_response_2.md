Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the time bins generation process. The error message indicates that there is an ambiguous time error when trying to infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00. This suggests that there might be an issue with the labeling of the time bins, particularly related to daylight saving time.

Bug's Cause:
The problematic function _get_time_bins() constructs the time bins using the date_range() function, which is encountering an ambiguous time error due to the presence of repeated times. This potentially results from incorrect handling of daylight saving time adjustments or duplicate timestamps.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of daylight saving time adjustments in the time bin creation process.
2. Investigate and resolve any potential issues related to duplicate timestamps or ambiguous times during time bin labeling.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = ax.round(self.freq)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the time bins are generated by rounding the timestamps to the nearest bins based on the specified frequency. This should address any potential issues related to ambiguous times or duplicate timestamps during time bin labeling.
