1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is part of the resampling functionality provided by Pandas and is called by the `groupby` operation in the failing test. The failing test attempts to resample a DataFrame using a daily frequency (`freq="1D"`) and calculate the mean, but it fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is caused by the `_get_time_bins` function which is unable to handle the transition to daylight saving time (DST) properly.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is the construction of the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function, and more specifically the construction of `binner` and `labels`, does not account for the potential ambiguity of time during the transition to daylight saving time. This causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the function is used for resampling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adjusting the construction of `binner` and `labels` to explicitly handle ambiguous times during the transition to and from daylight saving time.
   - Using a different approach for generating the time bins and labels that takes into account potential ambiguities in time.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, DataFrame
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas import NaT
from datetime import datetime

# this is the corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected function explicitly handles ambiguous times during the transition to and from daylight saving time, and should now pass the failing test without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
