1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to create time bins for grouping data, and it is called by the `groupby` function. The related functions in the same file include `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges`, which are all used within `_get_time_bins`. 

The GitHub issue indicates that the problem arises with the `groupby` function when dealing with daily frequency and ambiguous time errors on clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps, which is consistent with the GitHub issue's description of the problem.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is involved in creating time bins based on a specified frequency.
   (b). The related function `_get_timestamp_range_edges` is responsible for getting the timestamp range edges based on the minimum and maximum values of the input time index.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a specific example where the `groupby` function fails when dealing with daily frequency and ambiguous time errors on clock change day in Cuba. It indicates that the issue is related to the handling of timestamps around the clock change, causing the `groupby` function to raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring proper handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps within the `_get_time_bins` function.
   - Considering the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue and incorporating appropriate logic to handle ambiguous timestamps around the clock change day in Cuba.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use proper handling for time zones and ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # Include closed argument for proper handling
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, proper handling of time zones and ambiguous timestamps is included, and the `closed` argument is passed to the `date_range` function for appropriate handling of the time range edges. This should address the specific issue described in the GitHub report.
