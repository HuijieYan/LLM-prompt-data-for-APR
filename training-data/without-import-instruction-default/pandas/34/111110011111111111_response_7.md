Upon analyzing the input/output variable values and the error message, it is evident that the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data by day. This error occurs due to the presence of ambiguous time at midnight on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

The bug is likely to be related to the handling of ambiguous times in the `_get_time_bins` function. The `tz` attribute is being used, but it could be leading to incorrect bin edges and labels, especially around the time of the daylight saving time change. This is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping the data.

To fix the bug, the `_adjust_bin_edges` function should be modified to correctly handle ambiguous times and ensure that the bin edges and labels are generated accurately, taking into account the presence of ambiguous times due to daylight saving time changes.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function, taking into account the handling of ambiguous times and generating accurate bin edges and labels:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,  # Ensure correct handling of ambiguous times
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By updating the `_adjust_bin_edges` function to handle ambiguous times correctly and ensuring that the bin edges and labels reflect the correct time intervals with no ambiguity, the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `groupby` method with a daily frequency can be resolved.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
