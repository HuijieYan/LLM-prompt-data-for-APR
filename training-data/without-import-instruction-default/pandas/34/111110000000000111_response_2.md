1. The buggy function is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to the `groupby` call failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a specific date due to a long clock-change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely related to the generation of bins and labels for the grouping process, specifically when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change.

3. The bug is likely caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps when generating bins and labels for grouping. The function is not properly handling cases where there are ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Implementing special handling for ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes, possibly by using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to infer ambiguous times.
   - Checking the timezone information of the timestamps and adjusting the bin edges and labels accordingly to avoid ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bin_edges = pd.date_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)
    bins = ax.groupby(pd.cut(ax, bins=bin_edges, right=self.closed, labels=False, include_lowest=True))
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = bins.apply(lambda x: x.max())
    else:
        labels = bins.apply(lambda x: x.min())
    
    return bin_edges, bins, labels
```

This corrected code takes a different approach to generate bins and labels for the time intervals, using the `pd.date_range` function to generate bin edges and then categorizing the timestamps into bins with `pd.cut`. The labels are then determined from the bins based on whether the interval is open or closed. This revised approach should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the grouping works as expected even on ambiguous time days.
