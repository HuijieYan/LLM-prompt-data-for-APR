1. The buggy function is part of the TimeGrouper class. It is called by the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the `test_datetime_index.py` file. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError, and the failing test calls the buggy function by grouping the data using a time frequency of "1D".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the method `_get_time_bins`, specifically in the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges` and `labels` using the `date_range` method. The error message indicates that there are no repeated times, which suggests an issue with how the time bins are being constructed.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the presence of repeated times correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError. The failing test is designed to group the data with a time frequency of "1D", and the error occurs when constructing the time bins in the `_get_time_bins` method of the TimeGrouper class.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` method needs to be updated to handle repeated times correctly and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring. This can be done by refining how the time bins and labels are generated to account for repeated times.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
        
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    labels = date_range(
        start=binner[0],
        freq=self.freq,
        periods=len(binner),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By addressing the generation of time bins and labels, this corrected code should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring and make the function pass the failing test.
