The error in the given buggy code is due to the incorrect calculation of `first` and `last` values, which results in incorrect binning of the data, causing an ambiguous time error.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect creation of `binner` and `labels`, leading to incorrect bins being generated. This then causes the ambiguous time error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the calculations for `binner` and `labels` need to be adjusted based on the `first` and `last` values. Additionally, the logic for generating the bins needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure correct binning.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, NaT, date_range, DataFrame
import pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjustments based on first and last for binner and labels
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the adjustments for `binner` and `labels` have been made based on the `first` and `last` values. The logic for generating the bins has been retained, but with the necessary adjustments in place.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and provide the correct output based on the expected input/output variable information.
