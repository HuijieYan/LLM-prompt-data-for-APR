1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be related to the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the corresponding error message. The test is trying to downsample a datetime index with frequency '1H' to a daily frequency. However, on a clock change day in Cuba, an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be the use of `date_range` without handling ambiguous time.

3. The bug's cause is:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` does not handle ambiguous time correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). The failing test is trying to downsample a datetime index with frequency '1H' to a daily frequency, causing the ambiguous time issue.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the specific problem related to the clock-change day in Cuba and the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous time explicitly within the `_get_time_bins` function to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
   - Ensuring that the down-sampling process in the test takes into account the potential for ambiguous time on clock change days.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Check for ambiguous time and handle it
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._is_dst(ax):
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use the TZ from ax if available
    kwargs = {"freq": self.freq, "start": first, "end": last, "ambiguous": "infer", "nonexistent": "shift_forward"}
    if ax.tz is not None:
        kwargs["tz"] = ax.tz
    
    binner = labels = date_range(**kwargs, name=ax.name)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle ambiguous time correctly. This should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the clock-change day in Cuba.
