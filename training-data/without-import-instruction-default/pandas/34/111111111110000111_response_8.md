The issue seems to be related to handling of daylight saving time (DST) shifts, specifically on clock change days in certain timezones. The error is specifically related to handling the ambiguous time due to the clock change in Cuba, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The potential error location is likely within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. It appears that the function is not handling ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the groupby operation is performed in the test case.

The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating the time bins.
(b). The `TimeGrouper` class extends some other class (not provided), and it has a method `_adjust_bin_edges` called within `_get_time_bins`.
(c). The related functions are `_adjust_bin_edges`, `ax`, and some other internal methods which are not provided.
(d). The failing test attempts to downsample a datetime index that includes a DST shift in Cuba. The error message clearly states that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised during the groupby operation.
(e). The GitHub issue provides detailed information about the expected behavior and the specific scenario in which the bug occurs. The issue description also includes the expected output and the versions of pandas and other libraries being used.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the ambiguous time due to DST shifts is appropriately handled within the `_get_time_bins` function. This may involve using the `infer` parameter for ambiguous times or applying a strategy to handle the ambiguous times during binning.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    import pytz  # Import pytz library for handling timezones

    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times using infer parameter
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous times due to DST shifts, and the groupby operation in the failing test should no longer raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This solution should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well.
