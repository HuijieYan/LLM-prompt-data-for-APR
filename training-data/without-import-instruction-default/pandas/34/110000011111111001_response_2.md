The buggy function seems to be a method from the pandas library for time series data manipulation.

The error message indicates an issue with ambiguous time during a daylight saving time (DST) transition (AmbiguousTimeError). This suggests that there is an issue with handling the transition between standard time and DST.

From the failing test, we can see that it is trying to downsample the data based on a daily frequency after localization to the "America/Havana" timezone.

The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating the time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex and frequency. The bug may be related to how the function handles DST transitions.

The actual output values for 'binner' and 'labels' include dates transitioned into the DST period, which may cause ambiguous time errors when further operations are performed on them.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles DST transitions correctly and avoids ambiguity.

One possible approach to addressing this issue is to use the `DatetimeIndex.normalize` method to ensure a one-to-one mapping between the localized times and UTC. Additionally, using `DatetimeIndex.tz_localize` and `DatetimeIndex.tz_convert` within the `_get_time_bins` function may help in correctly handling the timezone transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.normalize()  # Ensure one-to-one mapping with UTC
    first, last = ax[[0, -1]]
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last + to_offset(self.freq), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, -1)  # insert a dummy value to adjust size

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle DST transitions properly and pass the failing test.
