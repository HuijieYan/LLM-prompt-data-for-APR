1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper`, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The function calls other related functions within the same class, such as `_adjust_bin_edges`, and also relies on external functions such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. The GitHub issue mentions a problem with daily frequency groupby failing on a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the calculation of bin edges and labels using the `date_range` function, and the adjustment of bin edges using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function. The issue might be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the way the bin edges and labels are being calculated and adjusted within the `_get_time_bins` function. This could potentially lead to ambiguous time errors, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue is specific to handling the transition during a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time can be ambiguous.

4. To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
   - Implementing a specific handling for ambiguous timestamps during clock change days, possibly by incorporating information about the time zone transition rules for the affected location.
   - Improving the handling of time intervals and bin edges to account for ambiguous times and transitions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # specify the closed parameter for the date_range
    )

    # Adjust bin edges
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes a specific adjustment to the `date_range` function by specifying the `closed` parameter to account for the ambiguity of timestamps during clock change days, which addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
