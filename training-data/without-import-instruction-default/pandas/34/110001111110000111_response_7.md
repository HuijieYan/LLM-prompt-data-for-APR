The buggy function is `_get_time_bins(self, ax)` from the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. This function is used to get time bins for a given DatetimeIndex. The failing test is `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` from the file `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the date_range function call, as indicated by the error message. It seems that the date_range function is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, which leads to the error.

The bug's cause is that the date_range function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly on clock change days, such as when daylight saving time starts or ends.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the date_range function to handle ambiguous timestamps more gracefully. This may involve using the `ambiguous` parameter in a different way or adding additional logic to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    bins = lib.generate_bins(ax.asi8, ax.freq, self.closed, self.freq)
    labels = bins[:-1]
    
    return ax, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, we are directly using the `lib.generate_bins` function to generate time bins based on the input `ax` (which is assumed to be a DatetimeIndex). This should handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively and pass the failing test.

This approach should resolve the issue and ensure that `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency works correctly on clock change days in Cuba.
