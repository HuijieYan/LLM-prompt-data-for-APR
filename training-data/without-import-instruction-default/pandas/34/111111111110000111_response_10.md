1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This function is related to other functions in the same file, such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges`. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` triggers an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a problem in the `_get_time_bins` function, as reported in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely in the calculation of `first` and `last` using the `_get_timstamp_range_edges` function, as it relates to handling the date and time information.

3. The potential cause of the bug is an issue with handling ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba, as indicated by the failing test and the error message. The GitHub issue also outlines the expected behavior and the version of pandas being used, showing that the bug may not have been fixed in the version currently being used.

4. The possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve updating the calculation of `first` and `last` in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba correctly.

5. The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max()
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the calculation of `first` and `last` directly from the `ax` without calling the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function. It also addresses the issue of ambiguous time on a clock change day in Cuba, as specified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
