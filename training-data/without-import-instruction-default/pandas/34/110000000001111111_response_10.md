The issue appears to be related to the AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba, which is not effectively handled by the buggy function. The problem seems to arise from the date_range method, which may be causing the AmbiguousTimeError when dealing with the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

The bug is likely caused by the fact that the function is not handling ambiguous times correctly, which leads to an incorrect frequency for the labels.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of the time bins to correctly account for ambiguous times, especially on clock change days. This means checking for ambiguous times and treating them appropriately when generating the bins and labels.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use the parameter `ambiguous = True` in the date_range function to handle ambiguous times. Additionally, we may need to modify the logic for generating time bins and labels to account for the ambiguous nature of the timestamps on clock change days.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=True,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should address the issue posted in the GitHub report and handle the ambiguous time error that arises on clock change days in Cuba.
