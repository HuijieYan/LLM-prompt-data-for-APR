1. The buggy function seems to be a method for getting time bins from a DatetimeIndex. It first checks if the input ax is a DatetimeIndex and raises a TypeError if it is not. Then it calculates the time bins and returns the result.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the calculation of time bins and the adjustment of labels.

3. The bug's cause could be due to potential issues in the calculation of time bins, adjustment of labels, and handling of NaN values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the calculation of time bins and adjusting the labels to ensure they are correct.
   - Handling NaN values appropriately to avoid errors.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

     # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, potential issues with the calculation of time bins and adjustment of labels have been addressed. Additionally, handling of NaN values has been made more robust.
