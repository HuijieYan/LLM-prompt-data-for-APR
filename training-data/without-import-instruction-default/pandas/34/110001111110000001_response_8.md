1. The `_get_time_bins` function is attempting to group data by time bins, but the error message indicates an issue with inferring daylight saving time (DST) when converting time zones. This suggests that the issue is related to how the time bins are being calculated.

2. The error likely occurs when the date range is created within the `_get_time_bins` function, as indicated by the stack trace pointing to `pandas/core/resample.py:1425: in _get_time_bins` and `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py:966: in date_range.` This is consistent with the error message mentioning a problem inferring DST.

3. The error occurs because the date range is being created in a way that doesn't account for daylight saving time changes, leading to an ambiguous time error when trying to infer the DST time.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using a different approach to calculate the time bins that accounts for daylight saving time changes.
   - Ensuring that the time zone conversion is handled correctly when creating the date range.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().round('1s')
    last = ax.max().round('1s')

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly round the `first` and `last` values to avoid precision issues that could lead to ambiguous time errors. This should resolve the issue with inferring DST and make the function pass the failing test.
