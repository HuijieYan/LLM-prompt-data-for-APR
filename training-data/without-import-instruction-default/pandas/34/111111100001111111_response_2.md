The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, as it seems to not handle the ambiguous timestamp caused by the clock change day in Cuba. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect handling of the ambiguous timestamps on the clock change day in Cuba. This error is further validated by the GitHub issue description, where it states that the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly by setting the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to `bool` (default is 'raise'). This will allow the function to proceed without raising an AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba.

Another possible approach is to explicitly handle the ambiguous timestamps in the `ax.tz` and `ax.asi8` by checking for the presence of ambiguous timestamps and providing alternative handling for them.

Additionally, the correction should address the issue described in the GitHub post, where the call to groupby should return three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) and the group for the 4th of November should be correctly labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the hourly data points for this day.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    if self.freq == 'D':
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=ax.min(), end=ax.max() + Timedelta(days=1), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous=True
        )
    else:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq, start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous=True, nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles the ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change day in Cuba and should resolve the issue as described in the GitHub post.
