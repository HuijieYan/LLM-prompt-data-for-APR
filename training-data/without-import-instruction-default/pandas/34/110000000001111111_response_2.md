The bug in the provided function is causing an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba because it does not handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post is also related to the same problem, as it points out that the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the variable `last`, where it results in a timestamp that is ambiguous due to the clock change day.

The bug is caused by the function not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, which leads to an incorrect grouping of the data.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `last` variable to ensure that it handles the ambiguous timestamp correctly. One approach to fix this issue is to explicitly handle the ambiguous time using the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, ultimately preventing the AmbiguousTimeError.
