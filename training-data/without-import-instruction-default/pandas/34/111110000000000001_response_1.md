1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is used to create time intervals for grouping data. It checks the type of the input `ax` and then proceeds to generate time bins and labels based on the frequency, closed end, and label parameters.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the logic for generating the time bins and labels, particularly in the calculation of `first` and `last`, as well as the adjustment of labels based on the closed and label parameters.

3. (a) The buggy function `_get_time_bins` attempts to create time bins and labels for grouping, but the logic for adjusting the bin edges and labels based on the closed and label parameters appears to be flawed.
   (b) The buggy class `TimeGrouper` is linked to the `_get_time_bins` function and provides the parameters and context for the time interval grouping.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Validate the calculation of `first` and `last` to ensure they cover the entire range without issues related to nanoseconds.
   - Carefully adjust the bin edges and labels according to the closed and label parameters.
   - Consider handling nanoseconds and NaN values more effectively.

5. Upon considering the potential issues and possible solutions, here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of "
            f"{type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Using regular date arithmetic to get bin edges and labels
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed)
    labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.label)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.values, binner.values, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we use regular date arithmetic to calculate the bin edges and labels, ensuring that they cover the entire range without any nanosecond issues. We have also adjusted the handling of NaN values and updated the calculation of `bins` to generate the time intervals correctly.
