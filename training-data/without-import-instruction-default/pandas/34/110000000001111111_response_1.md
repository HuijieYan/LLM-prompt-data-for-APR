The bug in the provided function seems to be related to handling the Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition in the timezone 'America/Havana', which results in an AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug is likely to be caused by the incorrect handling of the time bins and labels on the day of the DST transition, leading to the error when grouping with the daily frequency.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the ambiguous time during the DST transition.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0),
        end=ax[-1].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, closed=self.closed)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function does the following:
1. It creates the 'binner' and 'labels' using date_range with the start and end times adjusted to midnight, ensuring that the DST transition is handled correctly.
2. Updates the bin edges and bins generation. 
3. Inserts NaN in 'binner' and 'labels' if ax.hasnans is True.
4. Returns the corrected binner, bins, and labels.

This corrected function should now properly handle the ambiguous time during the DST transition and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
