1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which seems to be a custom grouping class for time-interval grouping. The function appears to be responsible for creating time bins and labels based on the input time axis.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation of the `bins` and the subsequent adjustment of `labels` and `binner`.

3. The bug's cause could be the incorrect generation of `bins` and the subsequent adjustments of `labels` and `binner`. This could result in misaligned bins and labels, leading to unexpected grouping behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the calculation of `bins` is correct and aligned with the specified time frequency.
   - Verifying the adjustments made to `labels` and `binner` and ensuring they are consistent with the calculated `bins`.
   - Handling edge cases such as NaN values in the input time axis.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # corrected DatetimeIndex to pd.DatetimeIndex
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = labels[1:] if self.label == "right" else labels

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # adjust the labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function has been updated to utilize the correct pandas functions and handle the adjustments of `labels` and `binner` based on the calculated `bins`. Additionally, the `Lib` module has been prefixed to `generate_bins_dt64` to clarify its origin.
