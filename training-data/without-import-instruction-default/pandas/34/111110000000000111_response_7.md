1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency, which fails with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables, as well as in handling the ambiguity of timestamps on clock change days.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating the time bins for grouping based on the input axis.
   (b). The buggy class `TimeGrouper` seems to be a custom implementation of a grouping class for time intervals in pandas.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides information that the problem arises on a clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, possibly using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function.
   - Checking and modifying the calculation of labels and bins to account for the ambiguous timestamps.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        # Convert ambiguous timestamps to non-ambiguous timestamps
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None)

        first = ax.min().normalize()
        last = ax.max().normalize() + Timedelta(days=1)
        labels = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)

        bins = ax.searchsorted(labels, side=self.closed, sorter=np.argsort(ax))

        return ax, bins, labels

```

Note: The corrected code handles the ambiguous timestamps by converting them to non-ambiguous timestamps before creating the labels and bins for grouping. This approach should help resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
