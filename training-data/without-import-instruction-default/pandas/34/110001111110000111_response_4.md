The problem occurs when the `groupby` method is called with a daily frequency on a datetime index that has an ambiguous timestamp due to a clock change. This causes an AmbiguousTimeError to be raised.

The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for handling the time bins for grouping, and the error is likely occurring when creating the bins for the ambiguous timestamp.

The failing test provides a specific scenario where an AmbiguousTimeError is raised, and the GitHub issue further explains the problem, expected output, and the version of pandas where the issue is observed.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively. This could involve identifying ambiguous times and addressing them accordingly when creating the bins for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if len(bins) < 1:
        raise ValueError("No bins created")

    labels = binner

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the ambiguous timestamps are handled appropriately when creating the bins for grouping.

With this corrected code, the failing test should now pass and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.
