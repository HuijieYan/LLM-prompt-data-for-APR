The bug seems to be caused by the calculation of the bin_edges and bins. The bin_edges are not being calculated correctly, leading to incorrect bins being generated. This is likely due to a misalignment between the calculations of bin_edges and the frequency of the time bins.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the bin_edges are calculated correctly based on the frequency of the time bins.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use frequency from self.freq to properly calculate the time range
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    # Calculate bin_edges based on the frequency of the time bins
    bin_edges = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Use binner.freq instead of self.freq for generating bins
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the bin_edges are calculated based on the frequency of the time bins (binner.asi8), and the bins are also generated using the same frequency. This should ensure that the bins are aligned correctly with the time intervals, fixing the bug.
