The problem in the provided function is that it is not handling the ambiguous time error effectively when using the `groupby` operation with daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The function `_get_time_bins` should handle this situation and avoid raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the time bins and labels for the `groupby` operation.

Additionally, the failing test and error message indicate that the function is not correctly labelling ambiguous timestamps, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `groupby`.

The expected output should be the correct labelling of timestamps, avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` and returning the three groups (one for each day - 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) as expected.

To fix the bug, the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change day in Cuba needs to be improved. This can be achieved by adjusting the labels and bins to correctly handle the ambiguous timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # adjust the labels to match the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the corrected code, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly and avoid raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output variable information. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
