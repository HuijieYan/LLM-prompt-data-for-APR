The bug in the provided function is likely related to handling the timestamp data in the presence of an ambiguous time zone shift, which is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The expected output is to return three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. However, the buggy function is incorrectly handling the time bins and labels, specifically on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

The problematic area of the function is likely the generation of the time bins and labels, as well as the handling of the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change. This is causing the function to return incorrect outputs and raise an error.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not properly handling the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba, leading to incorrect grouping and an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba and generate the time bins and labels in a way that doesn't raise an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import Timestamp, DateOffset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    last = ax.max().replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + DateOffset(days=1)

    binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed)
    bins = binner.searchsorted(ax, side=self.closed)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the original function.
