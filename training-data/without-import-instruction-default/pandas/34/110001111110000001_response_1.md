1. The buggy function is responsible for resampling a time series as per the specified frequency. The failing test is trying to downsample a time series to daily frequency, but the error occurs due to ambiguous time during daylight saving transitions.

2. The potential error location in the function is where the function creates labels using `date_range`. This is likely where the ambiguous time error occurs.

3. The bug is caused by the function not handling ambiguous times properly. The related function `date_range` is used to generate labels, and the failing test triggers an error related to ambiguous time. The error message indicates that the function is unable to infer dst time due to no repeated times.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Handle ambiguous times explicitly when creating labels using `date_range`.
   b. Ensure that the labels do not contain ambiguous times when the frequency is daily.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times when creating labels
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Ensure that the labels do not contain ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
    # (if statements are not changed)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By handling ambiguous times explicitly and ensuring that the labels do not contain ambiguous times, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
