The issue is related to the handling of ambiguous time on clock change day in Cuba. The bug occurs when the function tries to create bins and labels for the time group. It fails to handle the ambiguous time caused by the clock change.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the 'first' and 'last' timestamps and the subsequent creation of 'binner' and 'labels'.

The bug's cause is that the code does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change. This leads to incorrect binning and labeling, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle ambiguous times gracefully, ensuring that the bins and labels do not result in AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT')
    labels = binner.unique()

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles ambiguous timestamps by using the `floor` method with `ambiguous='NaT'` to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError. It then generates bins and labels based on the adjusted timestamps, ensuring that no ambiguous time causes an issue. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue and handle ambiguous times on clock change days in Cuba.
