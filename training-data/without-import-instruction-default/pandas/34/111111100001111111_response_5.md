Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue is likely related to the handling of daylight savings time and transitioning between different time zones.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is not handling the transition between different time zones and daylight savings time properly, which causes the AmbiguousTimeError.
(b). The class `TimeGrouper` and related functions are not effectively handling the time zone and daylight savings time ambiguities.
(c). The related functions `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges` also play a role in the overall functionality of the buggy function.
(d). The discrepancy between expected and actual input/output variable values is related to the incorrect handling of time zone and daylight savings time transitions.
(e). The GitHub issue information confirms that the bug is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when there is a long clock-change day in Cuba.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle daylight savings time transitions and time zone ambiguities within the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Ensure that the `TimeGrouper` class and related functions handle time zone and daylight savings time ambiguities effectively.
3. Consider using pandas' built-in functionality for handling time zone conversions and ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import date_range, Timestamp, NaT
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = self.freq.rollback(ax.min())
    last = self.freq.rollback(ax.max())
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    bin_edges = binner.asi8
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code should effectively handle time zone and daylight savings time ambiguities, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub post.
