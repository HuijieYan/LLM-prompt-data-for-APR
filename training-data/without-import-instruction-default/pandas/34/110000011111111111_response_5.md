The bug is likely located in the code segment that sets the binner and labels using the date_range function without considering the ambiguous timestamp issue on the clock-change day in Cuba. This may be causing the AmbiguousTimeError when grouping the data with pd.Grouper.

The failing test indicates that the groupby operation raises an AmbiguousTimeError due to the lack of handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the clock-change day in Cuba. This causes the test case to fail.

The GitHub issue confirms that on days with a clock change, such as November 4th, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and pd.Grouper does not handle it correctly.

To fix the bug, the code needs to account for the ambiguous timestamp on the clock-change day in Cuba. This can be achieved by adjusting the labels for the bins to include the ambiguous time. Additionally, the call to groupby using pd.Grouper needs to be updated to handle the ambiguous timestamp.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous to NaT to handle ambiguous timestamps
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]  # Adjust labels for 'right' label mode

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the ambiguous timestamp issue and pass the failing test. It also addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue and should no longer raise the AmbiguousTimeError.
