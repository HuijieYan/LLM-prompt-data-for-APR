1. The buggy function is a private method `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is called by other methods within the same class and interacts with the `DatetimeIndex` class and the `date_range` function. The failing test related to this bug is provided in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` variables, as indicated by the error message related to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. The bug is likely caused due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time (DST) when generating `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` for time intervals, as the error message mentions an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This could be due to incorrect handling of time zone localization and conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include ensuring proper handling of DST transitions when creating time bins, ensuring that time zone information is preserved during the binning process, and verifying that the `date_range` function is used appropriately for the given time zone.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer',
        nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8,
        bin_edges,
        self.closed,
        hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these corrections, the `_get_time_bins` function should now handle time intervals more appropriately, preserving time zone information and avoiding issues related to daylight savings time when generating bins. This should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` mentioned in the failing test.
