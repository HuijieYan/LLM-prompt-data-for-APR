The bug in the given function is likely to be caused by incorrect calculation of the date range when dealing with timezone conversions and the occurrence of daylight saving time. This leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the grouped operation is performed and the date range is utilized.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `date_range` function created for the bin edges and labels appropriately handles timezone conversions and daylight saving time. Additionally, the existence of non-unique time points needs to be considered and addressed, if necessary.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust timezone from original to UTC explicitly to avoid ambiguous time errors
    ax_utc = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert(ax.tz)

    first, last = ax_utc[0], ax_utc[-1]
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = pd.core.algorithms.arrays.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function adds an explicit timezone conversion to UTC and back during the date range calculation to avoid ambiguous time errors. Additionally, it retains and enforces the closed end behavior for creating date ranges. Given these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
