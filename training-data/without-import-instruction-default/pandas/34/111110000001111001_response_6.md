The bug in the function seems to be related to the frequency attribute and the time zone information not being handled correctly. The function is trying to create time bins based on the specified frequency and time zone, but it is returning the incorrect values for binner, labels, and bins.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the first and last timestamps, as well as the creation of the binner, labels, and bins. The time zone information also seems to be causing discrepancies in the output values.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the time zone information and frequency when creating the time bins. Additionally, the calculation of the first and last timestamps may not be taking the time zone into account properly.

To fix the bug, the time zone information should be handled consistently throughout the function. The calculation of the first and last timestamps should also consider the time zone. Additionally, the creation of binner, labels, and bins should be revised to ensure they are based on the correct frequency and time zone.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = bins = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, bins, labels

    first = ax.min().floor(self.freq)
    last = ax.max().floor(self.freq) + self.freq
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    labels = binner
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the first and last timestamps are calculated taking the frequency and time zone into account. The creation of binner, labels, and bins is also revised to ensure they are based on the correct frequency and time zone. This should address the discrepancies observed in the input/output variable values.
