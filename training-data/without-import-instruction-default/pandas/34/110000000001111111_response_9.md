The bug in the function seems to be related to handling the ambiguous timestamp on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The issue in the GitHub description also mentions the AmbiguousTimeError specifically.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the calculation of the `first` and `last` variables, which represent the first and last timestamps for the date range.

The bug is caused by the fact that when the date range includes an ambiguous timestamp due to a daylight saving time transition, the function does not handle it correctly. This leads to the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the ambiguous timestamp and ensure that the date range is calculated correctly, taking into account the daylight saving time transition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, date_range, NaT
from numpy import array

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = array([i for i in range(len(binner))])

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

This corrected implementation of the function handles the ambiguous timestamp correctly by adjusting the `first` and `last` timestamps using the `normalize` method and adding a day to the `last` timestamp. This ensures that the date range is calculated correctly, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub description.

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected output as mentioned in the GitHub issue and should no longer raise an AmbiguousTimeError.
