The buggy function is a method within the TimeGrouper class. It is intended to get the time bins for grouping time-interval data. The potential error location within the function is the section where it calculates the bins and labels.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations for the bins and labels, which may result in incorrect grouping of the time-interval data.

To fix the bug, we can revise the calculation of the bins and labels to ensure that they are generated accurately and correspond to the provided time data.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # recalculating the bins using correct parameters
        bins, binner, labels = generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, binner, labels, ax.hasnans, self.label)
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we have revised the calculation of the bins and labels by calling a new function `generate_bins_dt64` with the correct parameters and providing the necessary data for accurate calculation. This should fix the bug and ensure that the time-interval data is grouped correctly.
