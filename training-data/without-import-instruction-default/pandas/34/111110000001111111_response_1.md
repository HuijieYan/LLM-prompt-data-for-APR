The issue is related to handling ambiguous time during the clock change in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data by day.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps, as well as the subsequent creation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the ambiguous time during the clock change in the `date_range` function, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous time during the clock change properly. This can be achieved by using the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions to explicitly handle the timezone transition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    last = ax[-1].tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz) + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles the ambiguous time during the clock change by using `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions on the `first` and `last` timestamps before creating the `binner` and `labels` variables. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the time grouping is done correctly.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
