The potential error location within the problematic function is at line 1003, where the `_get_time_bins` function is called passing `self.ax` as a parameter.

The bug's cause is the incorrect handling of ambiguous time during a clock change day, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

To fix the bug, the problematic function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to handle ambiguous times correctly, particularly on a clock change day.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    idx = ax.indexer_between_time('00:00', '23:59')
    ax_filtered = ax[idx]
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax_filtered.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )
    
    ax_values = ax_filtered.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the ambiguous time issue by filtering the input `ax` to include only the non-ambiguous time periods when generating the bins and labels. This change ensures that the `AmbiguousTimeError` is avoided when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency.

I also noticed that the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function is called, but its actual implementation is not provided. Its correct behavior is crucial for the overall functionality of the `TimeGrouper` class. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the implementation of `_get_timestamp_range_edges` correctly handles time range calculations, especially in cases involving ambiguous time levels due to daylight saving time transitions.
