The issue here is that on a day when there is a clock change (such as the `America/Havana` time zone), the call to `groupby` raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This happens because the time binning logic in the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous times correctly.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle ambiguous times during the binning process, leading to an incorrect grouping and the eventual `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle ambiguous times properly to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This bug is consistent with the information provided in the GitHub issue.

Based on the failing test, the code should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00', and it should contain the hourly data points for this day.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    tz_info = ax.tz
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=tz_info,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version:
1. When creating the `binner` variable, we use `ambiguous="NaT"` to handle ambiguous times by representing them as Not-a-Time (NaT).
2. When there are NaNs in the input, we are now using `pd.NaT` to handle the potential NaN value at the beginning of the `binner` and `labels` arrays.
3. Lastly, we handle cases where there are more labels than bins by ensuring that the number of labels matches the number of bins.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
