1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
   - The failing test function tries to downsample the data using the `groupby` method with a daily frequency, which is leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps.
   - The GitHub issue details a similar problem where the `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised when working with timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba.
   
2. Potential Error Location:
   - The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is the handling of timestamps on clock change days, which is leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. Bug's Cause:
   (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for generating time bins for the given timestamp data.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class provides custom groupby functionality for time-interval grouping but is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.
   (c). The failing test is trying to group the data with a daily frequency, but due to the ambiguous timestamps (on a clock change day), an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised.
   (d). The GitHub issue details the problem of handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Correctly handle ambiguous timestamps that occur on clock change days. This may involve using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `tz_localize` method or introducing custom logic to handle such cases.
   - Ensure that the time bins are generated without encountering `AmbiguousTimeError` in scenarios involving ambiguous timestamps.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        # Handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Ensure correct handling of ambiguous timestamps
        binner, bins, labels = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values, ax)
        
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, extra handling for ambiguous timestamps on clock change days is introduced in the `_get_time_bins` function. The `tz_localize` method is used with the `ambiguous` parameter set to 'infer'. This should address the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure correct grouping of data.
