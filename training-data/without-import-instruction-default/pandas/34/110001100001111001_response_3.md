The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the creation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. The `date_range` function is used to create these variables, but it seems that the `end` argument passed to this function is causing issues with the resulting timestamp range.

Additionally, the `bin_edges` variable is being adjusted using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function, but it's not clear how this adjustment should be made based on the provided information.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could involve revisiting how the `binner` and `labels` variables are created using the `date_range` function, making sure that the inputs (especially the `start` and `end` arguments) are correctly defined. Additionally, the adjustments made to `bin_edges` using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function should be reviewed to ensure they are correctly reflecting the desired behavior.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    bin_freq = ax.freq
    tz = ax.tz
    ambiguous = "infer"
    nonexistent = "shift_forward"
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=bin_freq, tz=tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    else:
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `date_range` function is used to create the `binner` variable with appropriate arguments for `start`, `end`, `freq`, `tz`, `name`, `ambiguous`, and `nonexistent`. This should ensure that the timestamp range is correctly generated. Additionally, the adjustments made to `bin_edges` using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function have been maintained, assuming that the logic within that function is correct.
