The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` lies in the calculation of the variable `bin_edges`, which is used to generate the `bins` variable. The function `self._adjust_bin_edges` calculates the `bin_edges` based on the `binner` and `ax_values` variables, but the issue likely arises from an incorrect calculation in this function, leading to incorrect `bin_edges` and consequently incorrect `bins`.

The bug seems to be a result of incorrect calculation of `bin_edges` in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function that is called within the `_get_time_bins` function. The incorrect calculation of `bin_edges` results in incorrect `bins`, causing the failure of the tests. 

To fix the bug, the `_adjust_bin_edges` function needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it calculates the `bin_edges` accurately based on the provided parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    # Calculate bin_edges using the min and max values of ax
    bin_edges = np.linspace(ax_values.min(), ax_values.max(), len(binner) + 1)
    # Calculate bins using digitize to assign each value in ax_values to the appropriate bin
    bins = np.digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed == 'right')
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` has been revised to accurately assign each value in `ax_values` to the appropriate bin. Additionally, adjustments for labels have been made to match the corrected `bins` array.
