The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the handling of time intervals during a clock change day in Cuba. The issue described in the GitHub post indicates that on clock-change day, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp and the groupby operation raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the calculation of the bin edges and labels, which should account for the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day.

The bug's cause could be the incorrect handling of the ambiguous timestamp during the calculation of bin edges and labels in the TimeGrouper class. This is leading to the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to consider the ambiguous timestamp during the calculation of bin edges and labels. This may involve adjusting the logic to handle the clock change day more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')  # floor to the start of the day
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')  # ceil to the end of the day
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba correctly, addressing the issue described in the GitHub post.
