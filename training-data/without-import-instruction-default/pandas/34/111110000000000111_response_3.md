1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue is related to using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba, which indicates that the issue is likely related to how the time intervals are being handled or labeled.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function `_get_time_bins` appears to be in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels`, particularly when dealing with ambiguous timestamps due to the clock change.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating the time bins and labels for the groupby operation based on the input time index.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class is meant to handle time-interval grouping, and the issue is related to the handling of time intervals on clock change days in Cuba.
   (c). The GitHub issue details a specific case where a long clock-change day in Cuba results in an AmbiguousTimeError when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency, indicating that the handling of ambiguous timestamps is the core issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Handling ambiguous timestamps specifically for the time zone in question, in this case, America/Havana, by adjusting the `binner` and `labels` creation process.
   (b). Utilizing the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functionality to ensure that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly within the `_get_time_bins` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="before",  # Adjust for ambiguous timestamps
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made to handle the ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in the specified time zone (America/Havana) by adjusting the creation of `binner` and `labels` and setting the `ambiguous` parameter for the date range creation.
