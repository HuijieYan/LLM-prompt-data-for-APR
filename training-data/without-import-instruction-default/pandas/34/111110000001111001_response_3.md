The bug is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of bin_edges and bins, which results in the incorrect labels and binner being returned by the function. The problem may be related to the frequency and timezone adjustments.

To fix the bug, we can calculate the bin_edges and bins based on the first and last timestamps in the DatetimeIndex, while taking into account the time zone adjustments. Additionally, we need to ensure that the labels and binner are adjusted properly based on the closed and label parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().normalize()
    last = ax.max().normalize() + Timedelta(days=1)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = digitize(ax_values, bin_edges, right=self.closed == 'right')

    if self.closed == 'right':
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code calculates the first and last timestamps based on the input ax, then uses date_range to generate the binner with the specified frequency and timezone. The bin_edges and bins are calculated using the digitize function, and the labels are adjusted based on the closed parameter. The code also takes into account the possibility of NaN values in the input ax and adjusts the labels accordingly.
