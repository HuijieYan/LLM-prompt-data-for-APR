The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to the conversion of timezones and the handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time.

The issue appears to be in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` values, particularly related to the date range and time zone information.

To fix this bug, it is crucial to ensure that the date range is properly adjusted for DST transitions, and that the time zone information is handled correctly. This can involve using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters appropriately when creating the `DatetimeIndex` and ensuring that the date range generated takes into account any potential ambiguity due to DST transitions.

Additionally, the comparison between the number of bins and labels also needs to be accurate to avoid any inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    offset = to_offset(self.freq)
    closed = self.closed

    if self.closed == 'right':
        last -= offset

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name, closed=closed, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code adjusts how the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated, and explicitly accounts for the `closed` parameter when adjusting the date range. This should ensure that the date range is correctly adjusted for DST transitions and that the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters are used appropriately. Additionally, it checks the length of bins and labels to ensure consistency.

After applying the correction to the `_get_time_bins` function, it should pass the failing test and resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
