The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to the handling of time zones and the creation of datetime bins for resampling. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue with inferring the DST time, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time zone localization and conversion within the function.

The input parameters and output variables provided show that the function is creating datetime bins using the `date_range` function, handling time zones, and adjusting bin edges. However, the handling of time zone localization and conversion seems to be leading to the ambiguous time error.

In order to fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the time zone localization and conversion processes within the function are handled correctly, and that datetime bins are created without ambiguity.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to revise the way time zone localization and conversion are handled within the function, and to ensure that the datetime bins are created in a way that does not lead to ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, Series

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = date_range(start=ax.min(), end=ax.max(), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)
    
    ax_values = Series(ax).astype('int64')
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version of the function, the date range is created directly from the minimum and maximum values of the input 'ax', using the 'tz' attribute for the time zone. The bin edges are adjusted accordingly, and the bins are generated without ambiguity. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
