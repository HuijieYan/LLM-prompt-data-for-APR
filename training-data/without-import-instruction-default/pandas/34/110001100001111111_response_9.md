The issue appears to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba. The bug seems to be located in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the `binner` and `labels` calculation. The function is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` raised in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly and ensure that the groups are labeled as expected in the GitHub issue. This involves adjusting the calculation of `binner` and `labels` based on the presence of ambiguous timestamps.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    # Adjust bin edges based on the presence of ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._dst:
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges_dst(binner, ax_values)
    else:
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of bin edges is based on the presence of ambiguous timestamps using the `ax.tz._dst` attribute. This ensures that the groups are labeled correctly and the `AmbiguousTimeError` is avoided.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report and handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly.
