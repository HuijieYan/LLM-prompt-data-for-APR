The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the 'last' timestamp when there is a clock change that results in an ambiguous time. This causes the subsequent generation of bins and labels to be incorrect.

The bug's cause is likely due to the failure to handle ambiguous timestamps caused by clock changes, which results in an incorrect grouping of the data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps that occur due to clock changes. This can be achieved by using the 'ambiguous' parameter of the pandas date_range function to handle the ambiguous times and generate the correct frequency with the ambiguous time resolved accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        periods=len(ax),
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous='infer'
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the 'normalize' method on the first and last timestamps, and setting the 'ambiguous' parameter in the date_range function to 'infer', we can ensure that the ambiguous times due to clock changes are handled correctly. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report and correctly group the data by the specified frequency.
