The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the `date_range` method is used. It seems to be incorrectly computed, causing the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The failing test and error message from the GitHub issue confirm that the bug is causing an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue describes an incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the clock change.

The expected output is for the call to `groupby` to return three groups, labeling the group for the 4th of November as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing the 25 hourly data points for that day. The actual output, however, is an `AmbiguousTimeError`, as detailed in the error message.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` method within the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps and not raise an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these adjustments, the corrected function should handle ambiguous times correctly and not raise an error on clock change days.

The corrected function should satisfy the expectations provided in the failing test and the GitHub issue, and the implementation should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue.
