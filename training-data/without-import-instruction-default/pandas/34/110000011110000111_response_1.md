1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight`. The test is attempting to downsample a datetime index using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D").mean()`, but it fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of time zones and daylight saving time (DST) transitions, as the error occurs on a clock change day in Cuba.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to generate time bins for grouping, but it seems to struggle with handling ambiguous timestamps, especially in the context of daylight saving time transitions.
   (b). The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to perform a groupby operation on a time series that spans a clock change day in Cuba. This causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised, indicating that the timestamp at midnight is ambiguous due to the clock change.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides details about how the expected output should handle the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba, and it highlights the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Adjust the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps and time zone transitions more robustly, ensuring that it works correctly on clock change days.
   (b). Modify the function to check for ambiguous times and handle them appropriately, perhaps by providing an option to resolve the ambiguity in a customizable manner.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # handle ambiguous time on clock change days
    if len(ax) > 2 and ax[0] == ax[1]:
        ax = ax[1:]
    if len(ax) > 2 and ax[-1] == ax[-2]:
        ax = ax[:-1]

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By handling ambiguous times on clock change days and ensuring proper adjustment of the labels and bins based on the length of the indices, the corrected function aims to address the issues identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
