1. The buggy function is _get_time_bins within the TimeGrouper class. It is related to the related _get_timestamp_range_edges and _adjust_bin_edges functions, and the TimeGrouper class itself.

2. The potential error location is in the calculation of bin edges and labels, which is leading to an AmbiguousTimeError due to incorrect handling of the clock change day in Cuba.

3. Bug cause elucidation:
   (a). The buggy function _get_time_bins is not accurately handling bin edges and labels, leading to ambiguous times on a clock change day.
   (b). The TimeGrouper class is not correctly adjusting the bin edges and labels, contributing to the issue.
   (c). The related functions _get_timestamp_range_edges and _adjust_bin_edges are being called but not effectively handling the timezone ambiguity on the clock change day.
   (d). The failing test is attempting to group data with a daily frequency, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError due to the incorrect handling of the clock change day in Cuba.
   (e). Discrepancies in the bin edges, labels, and ambiguous times on the clock change day are leading to the failure of the failing test and the raised AmbiguousTimeError.
   (f). The GitHub issue outlines the problem, indicating that the call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), but the group for the 4th of November should be labelled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the hourly data points for that day without encountering the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Adjust the handling of bin edges and labels to correctly account for the clock change day.
   (b). Enhance the TimeGrouper class to accurately handle the timezone ambiguity.
   (c). Modify the related functions _get_timestamp_range_edges and _adjust_bin_edges to take into consideration the timezone ambiguity on the clock change day.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
