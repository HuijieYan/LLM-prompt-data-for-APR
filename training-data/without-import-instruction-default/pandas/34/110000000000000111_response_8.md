1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used in the context of grouping time series data. The GitHub issue relates to a specific problem that occurs when using the groupby function with a daily frequency on a day when there is a clock change in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, especially related to the creation of bins and labels for grouping the data.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba.
   (b). The GitHub issue information provides a specific example of how the issue manifests and the expected output when using the groupby function with a daily frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Enhance the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days, to ensure that the groupby function works correctly in such scenarios.
   - Adjust the creation of bins and labels to account for ambiguous timestamps and ensure that the grouping of data is done accurately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code enhances the handling of timestamps, especially on clock change days, and ensures that the groupby function works correctly in such scenarios. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
