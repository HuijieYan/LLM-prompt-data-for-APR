1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is located in the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. This class is related to several other functions in the same file, such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges`. The failing test for the function is provided in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` file, and the corresponding error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError due to handling of the clock change day. The GitHub issue provides further context on the problem, including the expected output and version information.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of bin edges and labels when dealing with ambiguous time on clock change day.

3. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to calculate bins, bin edges, and labels for time-based grouping. The `TimeGrouper` class is responsible for creating custom groupings for time intervals. The related functions include `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, which calculates the range of timestamps, and `_adjust_bin_edges`, which adjusts the bin edges based on the input.

The failing test in `test_datetime_index.py` attempts to downsample data based on daily frequency using `pd.Grouper`, and it fails with an AmbiguousTimeError due to handling of the clock change day in Cuba, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous time on clock change days, possibly by adjusting the calculation of bin edges and labels.
   - The calculation of bin edges and labels should take into account the ambiguity of time on clock change days to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code ensures that the `_get_time_bins` function properly handles the ambiguous time on clock change days and should pass the failing test while resolving the issue reported in the GitHub report.
