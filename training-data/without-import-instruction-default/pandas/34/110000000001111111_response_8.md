The issue is related to handling the ambiguous timestamps during a clock change, which is causing an AmbiguousTimeError when using the groupby function with a daily frequency in Cuba. This is evident from the GitHub issue description and the runtime values and types of the input parameters, as well as the variables at the function's return.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change in Cuba, particularly at midnight.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values, as well as the information from the GitHub issue, suggest that the code is not handling the ambiguous time properly on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly by adjusting the bin edges and labels according to the ambiguous time in Cuba to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Adjust for ambiguous midnight
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the groupby function with a daily frequency should handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError on the day of the clock change in Cuba.
