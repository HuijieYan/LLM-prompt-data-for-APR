The issue here is related to handling ambiguous time during a clock change day in Cuba. The problem arises because the `pd.Grouper` does not handle this ambiguous time correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The bug is likely located in the calculations for `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function. Specifically, the issue might be with how the time bins are being generated and labeled during a clock change day.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the ambiguous time correctly when generating the time bins and labels. This involves ensuring that the timestamps on the ambiguous date are correctly treated and grouped. 

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_time_bins` would be as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous time correctly and generate the time bins and labels as required, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
