1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper` and is used to create time bins for grouping. The GitHub issue details a specific problem with daily frequency failing on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError. The function is responsible for determining the time bins for grouping and seems to be the potential source of the issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days. This is evident from the GitHub issue description and the function's role in creating time bins for grouping.

3. The bug is likely caused due to improper handling of ambiguous timestamps during time bin creation. Since the function is responsible for creating time bins for grouping, any issues with identifying and handling ambiguous timestamps can lead to unexpected errors, as observed in the GitHub issue. The related functions, including `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, are used to adjust the bin edges and calculate the timestamp range, respectively.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include implementing logic to specifically handle ambiguous timestamps during time bin creation. This may involve identifying ambiguous time instances, adjusting bin edges accordingly, and ensuring that the grouping is performed correctly on clock change days.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
	# New logic to handle ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.tz is not None:
        ambiguous_idx = ax.tz_localize(None).index.difference(ax.tz_localize('UTC').index)
        first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz).drop(ambiguous_idx)
        last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz).drop(ambiguous_idx)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issue by adding new logic to handle ambiguous timestamps, specifically checking for timezone information and excluding ambiguous instances during time bin creation. This should help resolve the AmbiguousTimeError observed in the GitHub issue.
