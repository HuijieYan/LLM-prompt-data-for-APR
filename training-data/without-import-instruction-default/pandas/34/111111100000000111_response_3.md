1. The buggy function is `_get_time_bins`, which is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. This class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function is used to create time bins based on the input axis, and it seems to be failing when encountering an ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day in Cuba. The function calls other related functions like `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` to perform its operations.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be when it tries to handle the ambiguous timestamp during a clock change day. It may not be handling the timezone conversion and ambiguity resolution properly.

3. The cause of the bug can be ascertained from the following sources:
   (a). The buggy function: `_get_time_bins` does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day.
   (b). The buggy class: `TimeGrouper` is responsible for creating time bins, and the `_get_time_bins` function is one of its components.
   (c). The related functions: `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are called by `_get_time_bins` and may also contribute to the issue if they do not handle ambiguous timestamps properly.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: It describes the problem as occurring on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Properly handling ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day by using appropriate timezone conversion and ambiguity resolution methods.
   - Ensuring that the related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` also handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
   - Testing the fix on a clock change day in Cuba to verify that it resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), to_offset(self.freq), closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=to_offset(self.freq),
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code uses the `to_offset` function to create a `pandas.tseries.frequencies` offset from the frequency, ensuring proper handling of the frequency. It also utilizes the `date_range` function with appropriate frequency conversion and ambiguity resolution. By addressing these aspects, the corrected function aims to handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change day in Cuba.
