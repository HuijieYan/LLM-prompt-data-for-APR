The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the class `TimeGrouper` and it is used to calculate time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The issue arises on a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, causing the function to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the ambiguous timestamp when generating time bins, which leads to an error in the `groupby` operation. The `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated incorrectly due to the presence of nanosecond parts in the timestamp, causing discrepancies in bin and label generation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the ambiguous timestamps and generate correct time bins and labels for the `groupby` operation. Additionally, the function should handle time zone information properly when creating bins and labels.

A potential approach to fixing the bug could involve modifying the logic for `first` and `last` timestamp calculation, ensuring that nanosecond parts are taken into account. Additionally, the generation of bins and labels should consider the time zone information and handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Ensure that the start and end timestamps are constructed accurately
    # by taking nanosecond parts into account
    first = ax[0].floor(self.freq)
    last = ax[-1].ceil(self.freq)

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generate bins using the correct timestamps and time zone information
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust the labels if needed
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly and generate accurate time bins and labels, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
