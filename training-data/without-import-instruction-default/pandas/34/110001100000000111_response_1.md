1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` seems to be responsible for creating time bins based on the frequency of the data. The GitHub issue is related to the `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. This issue is due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, which the `_get_time_bins` function may be related to.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely in the handling of timestamps near a clock change where the timestamps become ambiguous. 

3. (a). Looking at the `_get_time_bins` function, it seems to be calculating the time bins based on the frequency provided. This calculation may not handle the edge case of ambiguous timestamps near a clock change day.

   (b). The related functions, such as `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`, are also involved in handling the timestamps and calculating the bin edges. These functions might contribute to the issue if they are not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

   (c). The GitHub issue information mentions that on a clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and this is not handled correctly by `pd.Grouper`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that ambiguous timestamps near a clock change are handled correctly, possibly by adjusting the bin edges or using the appropriate timestamp handling functions provided by pandas.
   - Update the calculation of time bins to take into account potential ambiguity near clock change days.
   - Check the related functions for any potential issues in handling ambiguous timestamps and adjust them accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Include ambiguity handling
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Change in calculation to handle potential ambiguity
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans,
        ambiguous="infer"  # Include ambiguity handling
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, ambiguity handling has been included in the relevant parts of the function to address the issue reported in the GitHub thread. Additionally, the calculation of time bins has been adjusted to handle potential ambiguity near clock change days.
