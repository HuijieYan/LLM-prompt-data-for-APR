The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is raising an error because it's not handling ambiguous times correctly when dealing with daylight savings time. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data at midnight on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

The issue is occurring at the line:
```python
binner, bins, labels = self._get_time_bins(self.ax)
```

The function is not properly handling the ambiguous time at the transition due to daylight savings time, resulting in an incorrect binning and label generation.

To fix this issue, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be updated to handle daylight savings time and ambiguous times properly. The code should be modified to use correct binning labels and handle the transition at midnight on the day of the clock change.

The updated version of the `_get_time_bins` function should look like this:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the cut method to handle ambiguous times and daylight savings time correctly
    bins = cut(ax, bins=date_range(ax[0], ax[-1] + Timedelta('1D'), freq=self.freq), include_lowest=True)
    labels = date_range(ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0), ax[-1], freq=self.freq)

    return bins, labels
```

This updated function uses the `cut` method to handle ambiguous times and daylight savings time correctly. It also generates the labels for the bins explicitly to handle the transition at midnight correctly.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
