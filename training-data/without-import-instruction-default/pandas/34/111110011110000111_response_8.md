The bug is likely related to the handling of timezone transitions, particularly on clock-change days. The failing test involves creating a DataFrame with an index containing timestamps with timezone information and then attempting to group the data using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError, which suggests that the issue is related to ambiguous or non-existent times during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

The bug is likely located in the _get_time_bins function of the TimeGrouper class, specifically in the date_range function call, where the ambiguous and non-existent parameters may need to be adjusted to handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the problem occurs on clock-change days in Cuba, where midnight local time is ambiguous due to the transition to daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, it is important to handle ambiguous times during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time. This can be done by adjusting the parameters used in the date_range function call to account for ambiguous and non-existent times.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq, 
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name, 
        ambiguous="infer", 
        nonexistent="shift_forward"  # Adjusted parameter to handle transitions
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the adjusted parameter in the date_range function call, the _get_time_bins function should now handle transitions between standard time and daylight saving time, resolving the AmbiguousTimeError and passing the failing test.
