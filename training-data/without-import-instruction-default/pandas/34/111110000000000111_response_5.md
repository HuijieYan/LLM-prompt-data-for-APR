1. The buggy function is a part of the TimeGrouper class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. It is called by the _get_time_bins function. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with groupby with daily frequency failing with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of timestamps on clock change days, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. (a). The _get_time_bins function contains the logic for generating time bins based on the input axis (ax) which should be a DatetimeIndex. The function then calculates the bin edges and finally generates the bins based on the calculated edges.
   (b). The TimeGrouper class is intended for time-interval grouping and customization of the groupby behavior for time series data.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a code sample that triggers the problem, as well as a detailed description of the problem, the expected output, and the versions of packages being used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for and handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, ensuring that the groupby operation does not raise AmbiguousTimeError.
   - Adapt the logic for generating time bins to account for ambiguous timestamps and handle them appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code includes modifications to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days and ensure that the groupby operation does not raise AmbiguousTimeError, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
