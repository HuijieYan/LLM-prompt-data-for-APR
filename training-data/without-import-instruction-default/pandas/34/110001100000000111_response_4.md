1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within a class that appears to be part of the pandas library. It is called within the context of grouping time-related data. The related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges` seem to be utility functions used within the `_get_time_bins` function. The GitHub issue involves a problem with the `groupby` function when working with daily frequency data on clock-change days in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, specifically when handling ambiguous timestamps.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the `binner` and `labels` in the `_get_time_bins` function. The issue on GitHub provides a specific example of the problem occurring when working with daily frequency data on clock-change days in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. This suggests that the ambiguous timestamps are not being handled correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating `binner` and `labels`. This may involve incorporating logic to handle ambiguous timestamps in a more robust manner, such as taking into account the occurrence of ambiguous time during clock-change days.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous timestamps
    if ax.tz._ambiguous_time() == 'NaT':
        ax = ax.dropna()

    binner = labels = pd.date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code includes a check for ambiguous timestamps using `ax.tz._ambiguous_time()` and drops any ambiguous timestamps using `ax = ax.dropna()` before creating `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. This should help address the issue related to the AmbiguousTimeError on clock-change days in Cuba as described in the GitHub issue.
