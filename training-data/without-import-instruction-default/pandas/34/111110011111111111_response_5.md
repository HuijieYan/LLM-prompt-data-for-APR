The bug originates from the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue occurs on a day when there is a clock change, such as the long clock-change day in Cuba on 2018-11-04. The method fails to handle this situation, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` reproduces the bug by creating a DataFrame with hourly data, then attempting to group it by day. The expected output is three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), but the method fails to correctly label the group for the 4th of November due to the clock change.

The error message from the failing test shows that the method raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the ambiguous timestamp at midnight on the clock change day.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class to handle ambiguous timestamps resulting from the clock change.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Use the timestamp at the end of each bin for constructing bins
    groups = ax.to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp('s')  # Convert to periods then to timestamps
    binner, bin_edges, labels = _bin_labels_from_focus_times(groups, self.freq, closed=self.closed)

    return binner, bin_edges, labels
```

With this correction, the method should handle ambiguous timestamps correctly for clock change days, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test.
