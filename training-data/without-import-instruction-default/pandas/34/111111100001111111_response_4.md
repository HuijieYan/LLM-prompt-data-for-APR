The issue seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, such as the one in Cuba.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of `first` and `last` timestamps. This might cause issues with ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

The bug's cause can be elucidated by analyzing the code as well as the GitHub issue. The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function is not handling the ambiguous timestamps correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Properly handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.
2. Ensuring that the `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated correctly, taking into account any potential ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first = ax[0].round('D')
        last = ax[-1].round('D')

        binner = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the ambiguous timestamps correctly and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
