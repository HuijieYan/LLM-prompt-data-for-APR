The bug seems to be related to the handling of the ambiguous time during the daylight saving time transition in the `pandas.core.resample` module.

The problem is likely caused by the `_get_time_bins` function, which is responsible for creating time bins while resampling. It seems to be handling the daylight saving time transition incorrectly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly, particularly around the transition time during the daylight saving time change.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + Timedelta(seconds=1),  # Add a second to handle ambiguous time
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The addition of `Timedelta(seconds=1)` to `last` when creating the `binner` and `labels` should handle the ambiguous time correctly, ensuring that no AmbiguousTimeError is raised during resampling.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
