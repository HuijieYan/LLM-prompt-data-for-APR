The bug in the `_get_time_bins` method is causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised in the failing test. The error is due to incorrect labeling of time bin edges which leads to ambiguous time during conversion from UTC to local time-zone. This bug is caused by improper handling of time zones and labeling.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to ensure that the bin edges are correctly labeled with the time zone information.
2. The `pytz` library should be used to handle time zones and ambiguous time situations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
from pytz.exceptions import AmbiguousTimeError

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    binner = labels = date_range(start=first.tz_convert(ax.tz), end=last.tz_convert(ax.tz), freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="NaT", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using `tz_convert` to ensure that the bin edges are in the same time zone as the input time index and handling ambiguous time using `ambiguous="NaT"`, the corrected method should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` that was raised in the failing test. The corrected method ensures that bin edges are correctly labeled with time zone information and handles ambiguous time situations appropriately.
