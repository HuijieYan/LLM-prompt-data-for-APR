Potential error location: The bug may be in the calculation of `bin_edges` as it seems to be incorrect based on the expected output.

Bug cause: 
- The calculation of `bin_edges` is incorrect, which leads to incorrect values for `bins`. This is likely due to incorrect calculations in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Review the calculation of `bin_edges` and ensure that it's correctly adjusted based on the input parameters and the values of `ax`.
- Check the implementation of `_adjust_bin_edges` to ensure that it's correctly adjusting the bin edges.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        freq=self.freq,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, adjustments have been made to the calculation of `bin_edges` and the function `_adjust_bin_edges` is called appropriately. Additionally, the date_range function has been updated to reflect the correct parameter order and naming.
