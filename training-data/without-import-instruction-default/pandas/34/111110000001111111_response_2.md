The bug appears to be related to the handling of ambiguous time during a clock change day in the `TimeGrouper` class.

The issue stems from the fact that on the day of the clock change in Cuba, midnight local time is ambiguous due to the time change. The buggy function fails to handle this ambiguity, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to properly handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba.

The corrected code for the problematic function should handle the ambiguous time, ensuring that the call to groupby with daily frequency returns the expected output of three groups: one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with the group for the 4th of November correctly labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing the hourly data points for that day.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max() + Timedelta(hours=1),  # ensure inclusive end for ambiguous time handling
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should address the ambiguity in time during the clock change day and ensure that the groupby operation with daily frequency behaves as expected, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.
