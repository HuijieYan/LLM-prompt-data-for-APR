1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `Resampler` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is being called by other methods within the same class, such as `_get_binner_for_time`, `_set_binner`, `_get_binner`, and subsequently `groupby` in the `pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py` file. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to execute a resampling operation and is resulting in a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.

2. The potential error in the `_get_time_bins` method could be in the `date_range` call, where the `ambiguous` argument is set to "infer". This might be causing the ambiguous time error to occur during the resampling operation.

3. The bug is likely caused by a mismatch of time zones during the resampling operation. The failing test is creating a DataFrame with a time index in the "America/Havana" time zone, and when the resampling is being done, it is encountering ambiguous time issues. This leads to the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve adjusting the time zone handling within the `_get_time_bins` method to ensure that ambiguous times are correctly handled during the resampling process. This could involve modifying the `tz` parameter in the `date_range` call or handling ambiguous times explicitly in the resampling logic.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times explicitly
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The correction involves adjusting the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` call to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times by inserting NaT values when they occur. This should resolve the issue of ambiguous time errors during the resampling operation.
