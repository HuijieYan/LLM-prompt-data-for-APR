1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating the time bins for grouping based on the input axis. The related functions include `_adjust_bin_edges`, `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, and `ax`.

The GitHub issue is related to the failure of the `groupby` function with daily frequency, especially when encountering ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it generates the time bins and tries to handle the ambiguous timestamps, especially when dealing with time zones and daylight saving time changes. 

3. (a). The `TimeGrouper` class, specifically the `_get_time_bins` function, may be failing to handle ambiguous timestamps, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). The related functions, such as `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, may also have some impact on the handling of time ranges and bin adjustments.
   (c). The function `ax` is called but its role in the bug is not explicitly stated.
   (d). The GitHub issue information indicates that on clock change days in Cuba, ambiguous timestamps are not being handled properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: 
   - Checking for and handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly
   - Ensuring proper handling of time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes 
   - Validating the frequency and closed parameters to account for edge cases
   - Enhancing the logic for generating time bins to accommodate ambiguous timestamps

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code incorporates checks for ambiguous timestamps and adjusts the time bins accordingly to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
