The problematic function is `_get_time_bins` which is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is calling this method indirectly when it calls the `groupby` method. The error message indicates that there is a problem with inferring a daylight saving time (dst) from a particular date and time.

The bug is likely caused by the method not handling daylight saving time transitions correctly, leading to an ambiguous time error. This is evident from the error message, where it mentions that it cannot infer the dst time from a specific date and time due to no repeated times.

To fix the bug, we need to handle daylight saving time transitions correctly in the `_get_time_bins` method. One approach could be to adjust the date ranges or bins to account for ambiguous times around dst transitions. Another approach could be to use appropriate timezone handling functions to deal with ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(self.freq)
    ax_normalized = ax_localized.normalize()

    # Create bins accounting for ambiguous times around dst transitions
    binner = date_range(start=ax_normalized.min(), end=ax_normalized.max(), freq=self.freq)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating timezone localization and normalization, as well as adjusting bins for ambiguous times, the corrected code should handle daylight saving time transitions more accurately, thus passing the failing test.
