The bug occurs due to the incorrect calculation of date ranges, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. This error arises because there are repeated times in the time range, and the time zone information is lost in the computation.

To fix the bug, the correct time values should be used to generate the date ranges. We can achieve this by using the `ceil` and `floor` functions to retrieve the upper and lower bounds of each date range, respectively. Additionally, the time zone information should be retained for all date range calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    freq = to_offset(self.freq)

    # Calculate the start and end of each date range
    start = self.freq.rollback(ax[0].floor("1D"))
    end = self.freq.rollback(ax[-1].floor("1D")) + freq

    bins = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bins, ax)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust labels based on 'closed' and 'label' parameters
    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
        else:
            labels = binner
    else:
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = binner[1:]
        else:
            labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the start and end of each date range are calculated using the `rollback` and `floor` functions. This ensures that the time zone information is retained and that each date range is correctly defined. Additionally, the `_adjust_bin_edges` is called with the corrected `bins` and `ax` arrays. These changes should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and produce the correct date ranges.
