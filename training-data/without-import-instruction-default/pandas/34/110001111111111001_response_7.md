The bug is likely caused by an incorrect calculation of the `first` and `last` timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function, leading to an ambiguous time error when trying to perform the resampling.

The `first` and `last` timestamps are calculated using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, which in turn calls `date_range` to create `binner` and `labels`. The returned `binner` and `labels` are being used to calculate `first` and `last`, but they are created using the same range which results in overlapping day boundaries when the timezone includes daylight saving time transitions. This inconsistency leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this issue, we should calculate the `first` and `last` timestamps correctly using the original `ax` time range.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
- Pass the original `ax` time range to the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to calculate `first` and `last` timestamps.
- Ensure that the `first` and `last` timestamps do not contain overlapping day boundaries.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(first, last, self.freq, ax)

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code addresses the bug by correctly calculating the `first` and `last` timestamps and ensuring that there are no overlapping day boundaries, which should resolve the ambiguous time error as observed in the failing test.
