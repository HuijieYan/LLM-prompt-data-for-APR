The buggy function is a method within the TimeGrouper class, which is a subclass of the Grouper class. The function is designed to get time bins for the given axis.

The potential error location is within the date_range function call, where there might be an issue with the start and end arguments. Additionally, the adjust_bin_edges function might also be causing the bug.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculation of the start and end dates for the time bins, as well as potential issues in adjusting the bin edges using the _adjust_bin_edges function.

To fix the bug, possible approaches could include reviewing the calculation of start and end dates, ensuring that the adjust_bin_edges function is working correctly, and checking the logic for adjusting labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
    binner = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        closed=self.closed,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner
    
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)
    
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the date_range function is used to get the start and end dates for the time bins, and the logic for adjusting labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters has been updated. Additionally, the _adjust_bin_edges function is called with the correct parameters.
