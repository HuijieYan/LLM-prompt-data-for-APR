The potential error in the buggy function is likely in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the date_range call within it, which is leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

This bug seems to be causing an issue in handling ambiguous timestamps on a day with a clock change in Cuba, particularly around midnight local time. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group the data using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')`, and it's raising an AmbiguousTimeError due to the ambiguous timestamp.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that the call to groupby should return three groups, one for each day, and the group for the ambiguous day should be labeled correctly with the timestamp before the clock change.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamps properly and label the groups correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Remove timezone to handle ambiguous times

    # Use the floor and ceil functions to handle ambiguous times properly
    binner = ax.floor(self.freq)
    labels = ax.ceil(self.freq)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code properly handles ambiguous timestamps by removing the timezone from the index and using the `floor` and `ceil` functions to handle the timestamps correctly. Additionally, it keeps the logic for labels and bins consistent. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
