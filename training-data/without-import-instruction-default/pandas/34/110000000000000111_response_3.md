1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and it is related to the GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba". The issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during groupby operations with daily frequency.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in handling the ambiguous timestamps and the frequency of the time bins.

3. (a) The buggy function is part of the pandas library and is used for generating time bins for groupby operations based on datetime indices.
   (b) The GitHub issue reports that on clock change days in Cuba, ambiguous timestamps are not handled correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError during groupby operations with daily frequency. The expected output is to have the group for the ambiguous day labeled with the first midnight timestamp before the clock change and containing the hourly data points for that day.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Improved handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock change days.
   - Ensuring that the frequency of the time bins aligns with the expected output, taking into account the ambiguous timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # Ensure the same closed parameter is used for consistency
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `date_range` function is updated to include the `closed` parameter to ensure consistency in handling the ambiguous timestamps. Additionally, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "infer" to handle ambiguous times appropriately. These changes would help to ensure that the function can handle the ambiguous timestamps as expected in the GitHub issue.
