Based on the information provided, the buggy function is `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post is related to handling ambiguous time on specific days in certain timezones.

The potential error location in the _get_time_bins function is likely related to the calculation of bins and labels, specifically with regards to handling ambiguous times.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles ambiguous times when calculating bins and labels, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Handling ambiguous times explicitly by checking for them and adjusting the bins and labels accordingly.
- Using the appropriate timezone handling methods provided by pandas to handle ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # Handle ambiguous times
    if binner.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles ambiguous times and adjusts the bins and labels accordingly, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and provide the expected output for the groupby operation as described in the GitHub issue.
