1. The problematic function is `_get_time_bins`, which is likely a method of a larger class as it refers to `self`. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is testing the functionality of resampling a DataFrame with a DateTimeIndex with a frequency of 1 day.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of bins and labels. The error message indicates an issue with inferring DST time, which could be related to the way bins and labels are calculated.

3. The bug is likely caused by an improper calculation of time bins and labels that does not account for the possibility of ambiguous times in the DateTimeIndex. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when attempting to perform resampling.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adjusting the way time bins and labels are calculated to account for ambiguous times, or handling ambiguous times explicitly to avoid the error.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust for ambiguous times
    ax = ax.drop_duplicates()
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we first handle ambiguous times in the DateTimeIndex `ax` by removing duplicates. This adjustment allows for proper calculation of time bins and labels. The corrected function should now pass the failing test without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
