1. The buggy function in question is `_get_time_bins` which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The failing test function is testing the `groupby` operation using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")` which internally calls the `_get_time_bins` function.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is that it is not handling the daylight savings time (DST) correctly when creating the `binner` and `labels` for time bins.

3. The bug is occurring due to the incorrect handling of daylight savings time (DST) while creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. This results in an AmbiguousTimeError when the code encounters a repeated time during the conversion of time zones. The failing test is triggering this error while attempting to perform a time-based grouping operation.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `binner` and `labels` are created taking into account the daylight savings time (DST) to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError.
   - Use the appropriate method to create the `binner` and `labels` that considers DST when using the `date_range` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Create binner and labels with appropriate handling of DST
    tz = ax.tz if ax.tz is not None else self.freq.tz
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward" if self.closed == "left" else "shift_backward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```
This corrected code creates the `binner` and `labels` taking into account the daylight savings time (DST) by specifying the behavior for ambiguous and nonexistent times when creating the `binner` using the `date_range` function. This ensures that the AmbiguousTimeError is avoided and the function should now pass the failing test.
