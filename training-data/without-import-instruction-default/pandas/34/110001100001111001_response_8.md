The buggy function is trying to calculate time bins based on the given input. It calls the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function to get the first and last timestamps, then creates bin edges and labels. It generates bins based on the bin edges and labels, manipulating them based on the closed and label parameters.

The bug is causing incorrect binning and labeling of the time series due to incorrect usage of the `date_range` function and improper manipulation of labels and bins.

The potential error location is in the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. The usage of `start=first` and `end=last` in the `date_range` function is causing incorrect binning as it does not align with the desired behavior.

To fix the bug, the `start` and `end` parameters in the `date_range` function should be adjusted to align with the expected behavior. Additionally, manipulation of labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters should be revisited.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min() - pd.Timedelta(self.freq)
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code aligns the `date_range` start and end parameters to achieve the desired behavior for calculating time bins. It also adjusts the manipulation of labels and bins based on the closed and label parameters.
