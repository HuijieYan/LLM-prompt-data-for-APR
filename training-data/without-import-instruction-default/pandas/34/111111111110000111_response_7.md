The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is within the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function is part of the logic for grouping time intervals, and it specifically handles the case where the axis is not a DatetimeIndex, raising a TypeError if that's the case. It then proceeds to calculate the time bins and labels based on the frequency and the input axis.

The failing test creates a datetime index with a non-unique timestamp because of a clock change in Cuba, and then attempts to group the data by day using the `pd.Grouper` class.

The error message indicates a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to infer the DST time from November 4, 2018, 00:00:00, due to repeated times on that day, which leads to a problem with grouping the data.

The corresponding GitHub issue provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the expected output, and the versions of Python and pandas used.

To fix the bug:
1. The function `_get_time_bins` likely needs to handle ambiguous times caused by DST transitions, possibly by handling the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` and finding a way to consistently label ambiguous timestamps.
2. The logic in the function `_get_time_bins` should be updated to address the specific case of ambiguous times when creating the date range for the labels.

Here's a corrected version of `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Handling ambiguous times
    try:
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
    except pytz.AmbiguousTimeError:
        # For ambiguous times, use 'infer' to handle DST transitions
        first = ax[0]
        last = ax[-1]

    # Rest of the logic remains the same
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of `_get_time_bins` should handle the ambiguous times caused by the DST transitions, as reported in the GitHub issue, and pass the failing test.
