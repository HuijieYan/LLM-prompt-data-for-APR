The bug in the provided function is likely due to the recursive call to the `pivot_table` function within the function itself. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results, as it may not handle the input parameters and data correctly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the recursive call to `pivot_table` and instead implement the aggregation for multiple functions directly within the same function, without the need for recursion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = index + columns
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)

        table = concat(pieces, keys=aggfunc, axis=1)
    else:
        keys = index + columns
        grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
        table = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...

    return table
```

By directly handling the aggregation for multiple functions within the same function, the recursive call is removed, and the potential for unexpected behavior is mitigated. The function now should be able to handle the expected input/output variable information provided in the test cases.
