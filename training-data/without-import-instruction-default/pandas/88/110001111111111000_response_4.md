The issue in the `pivot_table` function arises from the fact that it's calling itself recursively in some cases, but it's not properly handling the different cases of inputs, leading to an infinite loop. 

To fix this, we need to refactor the function to avoid the infinite recursive calls. Instead, we can implement the function using a loop or a more iterative approach to handle the different types of input parameters provided. 

Since the `pivot_table` function is quite complex, it's not a simple fix. The logic for handling the different inputs should be carefully considered to ensure correctness. Therefore, a significant refactoring of this function is required, considering input validation checks to avoid infinite recursion, and properly handling the calculation of the pivot table.

I can provide some simple alterations to start the refactor, but a comprehensive review and rewrite are necessary to ensure all types of input are handled correctly:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Add input validation checks to avoid infinite recursion
    if values is None or index is None or columns is None:
        raise ValueError("Required arguments 'values', 'index', and 'columns' must be specified.")

    if not is_list_like(values):
        values = [values]

    # Handle pivot table calculation iteratively
    pivot_table_result = calculate_pivot_table(data, values, index, columns, aggfunc, fill_value, margins, dropna, margins_name, observed)

    return pivot_table_result
```

Please note that the `calculate_pivot_table` function here is just a placeholder for the actual iterative implementation of the pivot table calculation, which would handle cases where `aggfunc` is a list, check for `margins`, and handle the grouping and aggregation of data.

This fix requires a thorough review of the structure and logic of the `pivot_table` function, along with proper implementation of the iterative pivot table calculation.
