The buggy function is pivot_table, which is used to perform pivoting on a DataFrame. The failing test is trying to create a pivot table with multiple indices and columns. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised because the code is trying to access the 'columns' attribute on a Series object, and it does not exist.

The potential error location within the function is when trying to access table.columns.nlevels. This indicates that the 'table' variable is a Series, not a DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that when the pivot_table function is called recursively to handle multiple aggfunc values, the returned result is not being handled correctly as both a DataFrame and a Series.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to handle both DataFrame and Series as the result of the pivot_table function, and perform appropriate operations based on the type of the result.

Here's the corrected code for the pivot_table function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":

    # Existing code remains here

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Check if the result is a Series
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        data = data.to_frame()

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

The modification ensures that the result of the pivot_table function is converted to a DataFrame if it is a Series before performing further operations. This will resolve the AttributeError issue and the function should pass the failing test.
