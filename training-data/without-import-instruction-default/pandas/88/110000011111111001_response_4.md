The bug in the `pivot_table` function appears to be related to the recursive call to `pivot_table` with lists of aggregation functions, resulting in nested calls and erroneous DataFrame output. The recursion potentially leads to stacking when unwinding the inner recursive calls. It's likely that there is an infinite recursive call issue occurring here.

The failing test, along with the error messages, indicates that the bug is causing problems with the implementation of `pivot_table`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
1. Adding base cases to the recursive implementation to terminate the recursion when specific conditions are met.
2. Modifying the logic to handle the passing of lists of aggregation functions without triggering the recursive calls.

The corrected code should address the issues with the recursive function call and ensure that it passes the failing test, providing the expected input/output variable behavior.

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
):
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Additional check for list of aggregation functions
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same
```

This corrected implementation includes an additional check for a list of aggregation functions and iterates through each function, terminating the recursion. This should address the issue with infinite recursion and resolve the problem seen in the failing test cases.
