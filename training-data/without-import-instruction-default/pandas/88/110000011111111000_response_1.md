The issue with the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the `table.columns.nlevels` attribute that is causing an `AttributeError`. Specifically, it is trying to access the `nlevels` attribute on a Series object, which does not have that attribute.

One way to fix this would be to ensure that the `table` variable is always a DataFrame before trying to access the `nlevels` attribute.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex
import pandas.api.types as ptypes
import pandas.util._decorators as decorators
import pandas.core.groupby.groupby as groupby

def pivot_table(
    data: DataFrame,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> DataFrame:
    table = DataFrame()
  
    # ... rest of the function ...
  
    if isinstance(table, DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... rest of the function ...

    return table
```

In this corrected version, before we attempt to access the `nlevels` attribute on the `table.columns`, we first check if `table` is an instance of a DataFrame. If it is not, then we won't attempt to access the `nlevels` attribute, which should address the `AttributeError` issue.

Please note that you may need to adjust the code within the function to match the original functionality, but this adjustment should resolve the immediate issue with the `AttributeError`.
