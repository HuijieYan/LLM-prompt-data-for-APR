The problem in the provided code seems to be related to the "pivot_table" function and its inability to correctly handle the "columns" format when it consists of multi-index values.

The failing test is trying to create a pivot table from a DataFrame using multi-index columns and is failing with an AttributeError, as it cannot access the 'columns' attribute.

The potential error location within the "pivot_table" function is when it checks `(table.columns.nlevels > 1)`.

The bug is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute, as this attribute might not be available in the specific context of the function.

To fix this issue, the "pivot_table" function needs to be modified to handle multi-index columns correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)
    
    if isinstance(columns, (tuple, list)):
        columns = [str(col) for col in columns]
    elif isinstance(columns, dict):
        columns = [str(columns)]
    
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return pd.concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected version, we have added a type check for the 'columns' parameter to handle both single and multi-index cases. We convert the columns to a list of strings if it's a tuple, list, or a dictionary. This should fix the issue with accessing the 'columns' attribute and make the function work correctly with multi-index columns.

Additionally, we have changed the import statement to `import pandas as pd` to ensure that the function calls to `concat` and `DataFrame` are using the correct module names.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
