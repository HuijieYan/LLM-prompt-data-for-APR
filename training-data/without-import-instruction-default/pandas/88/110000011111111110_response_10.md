The issue with the pivot_table function is that it's not handling multi-index columns correctly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to pivot the table with multi-index columns. Based on the failing tests and their associated runtime value/type information, it seems that the issue lies in the way the multi-index columns are being handled.

To address this issue, the pivot_table function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of multi-index columns. A potential solution would be to add a conditional check to handle multi-index columns separately, ensuring that the pivot operation works correctly for this case.

Here is the corrected version of the pivot_table function:

```python
from typing import List
from pandas import DataFrame, concat, MultiIndex, Index
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper
from pandas.core.frame import ABCDataFrame
from pandas.core.algorithms import is_integer_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import maybe_downcast_to_dtype
from pandas.core.arrays import is_list_like
from pandas.core.frame import _shared_docs
from pandas.core.reshape.pivot import _convert_by, _add_margins
from pandas.core.reshape.pivot import pivot_table as original_pivot_table

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    # original_pivot_table handles the pivot_table logic
    table = original_pivot_table(
        data,
        values=values,
        index=index,
        columns=columns,
        aggfunc=aggfunc,
        fill_value=fill_value,
        margins=margins,
        dropna=dropna,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        observed=observed,
    )

    return table
```

By adding this conditional check and making use of the original pivot_table function to handle the pivot logic, the issue with multi-index columns should be resolved.

It is important to thoroughly test this corrected version to ensure that it handles multi-index columns correctly and doesn't introduce any regressions.

The corrected function should also be accompanied by appropriate tests to validate its functionality. After verifying the functionality of the fix, a pull request can be submitted to the pandas repository for review and integration.
