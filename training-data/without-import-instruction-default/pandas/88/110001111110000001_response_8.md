The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The function is trying to perform a pivot_table operation on the input data. The error message suggests that there is an AttributeError related to the `columns` attribute in the `table` object, which is likely a Series object at the time of the error.

This suggests that the potential error location is in the section of code where the `table` object gets created and manipulated within the `pivot_table` function.

The `pivot_table` function calls itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list. This would create new `table` objects, which are concatenated in the end. However, this recursion seems to cause the issue as the `inning.columns.nlevels` check is performed on the result, which is a Series instead of the expected DataFrame. This is likely causing the AttributeError on the Series object.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the recursive call to the `pivot_table` function when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead of performing the recursive call and manipulating multiple `table` objects, the function should aggregate the results within a single `table` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...
    
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        table = pivot_table(
            data,
            values=values,
            index=index,
            columns=columns,
            fill_value=fill_value,
            aggfunc=aggfunc[0],  # Use the first aggfunc
            margins=margins,
            dropna=dropna,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            observed=observed,
        )
        for func in aggfunc[1:]:
            result = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            table = concat([table, result], axis=1)

        return table
    # existing code...

```

In the corrected code, when `aggfunc` is a list, the function only performs the recursive call to `pivot_table` once using the first `aggfunc`. The results for the other `aggfunc` values are then concatenated to the initial `table` object using the `concat` function. This ensures that the `table` object remains a DataFrame throughout the aggregation process.

By making this modification, the corrected `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test.
