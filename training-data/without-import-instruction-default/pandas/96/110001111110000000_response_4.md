The error message indicates a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method, and it suggests that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency CBH. This error is likely due to a bug in the `apply` function.

The `apply` function tries to handle business hours, but there are issues with the logic which are causing the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):    
        n = self.n
        
        business_day_offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays, weekmask=self.weekmask, normalize=True)

        if n >= 0:
            other += business_day_offset
        else:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                other -= business_day_offset

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the CustomBusinessHour offset directly, the function simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime and should resolve the errors encountered in the failing test. This correction should help to pass the failing test and resolve the issues with the `apply` function.
