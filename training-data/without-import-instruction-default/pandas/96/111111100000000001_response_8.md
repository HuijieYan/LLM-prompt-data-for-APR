Potential error location: 
The buggy function has a potential error in the if-else statement where it tries to adjust the datetime depending on the value of n. There are multiple operations being performed to adjust the datetime, and it's possible that the logic for these adjustments is incorrect.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to a given datetime. It performs various calculations and adjustments to determine the resulting datetime based on the offset.
(b). The buggy class contains related functions that are called within the buggy function to perform specific calculations and adjustments related to business hours.
(c). The related functions perform operations such as determining business hours, finding opening and closing times, and adjusting datetimes based on business day offsets.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the value of n
2. Check the calculations for business hours and opening/closing times
3. Consider refactoring the code to make it clearer and reduce the likelihood of errors
4. Use proper error handling to catch any potential issues

Corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other related functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:

                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:

                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(self.n) * 60)

                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
