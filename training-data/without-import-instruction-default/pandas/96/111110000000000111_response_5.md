1. The buggy function is `apply` which is a method of the class `BusinessHourMixin`. The GitHub issue is related to Pandas `date_range` function and the CustomBusinessHour offset, which is directly related to the behavior of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

2. The potential error location within the `apply` method is in the logic that handles adjusting the business hours based on the provided input. This logic is complex and prone to potential bugs that could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the complex adjustment of business hours within the `apply` method. The `apply` method appears to adjust the business hours based on input parameters, and this adjustment might be incorrect, especially when dealing with edge cases and holidays. The GitHub issue points to an issue with the behavior of the `date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, which aligns with the complexity of the business hour adjustment logic in the `apply` method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include simplifying the logic for adjusting business hours, ensuring proper handling of holidays, and thoroughly testing the method with different edge cases to identify and fix any potential issues.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust other to the start of the business hours
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Loop through the number of business hours to adjust
        for _ in range(abs(self.n)):
            if self.n >= 0:
                # If adding business hours
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # If subtracting business hours
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic for adjusting business hours and ensures that the adjustment is based on the start of the business hours. It removes the complex business day adjustments and focuses solely on adjusting the provided datetime based on the number of business hours. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
