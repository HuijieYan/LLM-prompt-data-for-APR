The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is used to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be centered around the adjustment of the datetime `other` based on the business hours and holidays. The logic for adjusting the datetime appears to be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when holidays are involved.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime `other` when holidays are added. This causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing and revising the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle holidays appropriately within the function to ensure that the adjustment is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:

    # ... (other functions)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust for holidays
            while pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays)._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays)

            # Adjust for business hours
            hours_remain, remaining = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            if n < 0:
                hours_remain, remaining = -hours_remain, -remaining

            while hours_remain != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays)
                else:
                    other -= pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00', holidays=self.holidays)
                hours_remain -= 1

            other += timedelta(minutes=remaining)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code revises the adjusting logic to correctly handle holidays and business hours when adjusting the datetime `other`. It introduces a while loop to adjust for holidays and then adjusts for business hours based on the value of `n`. This revised approach should address the issue and the failing test case.
