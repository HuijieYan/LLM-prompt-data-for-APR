The buggy function `apply` has several potential issues, including incorrect references to class methods and incorrect use of datetime objects. The buggy class `BusinessHourMixin` contains several methods that are called within the `apply` function, such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset`. 

The potential error within the buggy function is the incorrect reference to class methods like `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`, which should be `self.is_on_offset(other)`.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of class methods and the improper adjustment of datetime objects within the function. This could lead to unexpected results and errors.

To fix the bug, the incorrect references to class methods should be corrected, and the manipulation of datetime objects should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta

# ... (Other parts of the code remain unchanged)

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (Other methods remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
