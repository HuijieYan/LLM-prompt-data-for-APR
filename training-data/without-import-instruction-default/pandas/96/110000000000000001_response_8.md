1. The buggy function takes in a datetime object and performs some calculations based on business hours and days. It then returns the adjusted datetime object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation of business days and remaining business hours, as well as the adjustment of the datetime object based on these calculations.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect calculations and adjustments, leading to incorrect results when trying to adjust the datetime object based on business days and hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the calculations for business days and remaining business hours to ensure they are correct.
   - Verify the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and hours.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# this is the corrected function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), 8)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=bd)

        # business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r*60)

        if n > 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                business_day_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 17, 0, 0)
                if other.time() <= business_day_end.time():
                    bhour = business_day_end - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 9, 0, 0) + timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 9, 0, 0) + timedelta(days=1)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                business_day_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 9, 0, 0)
                if other.time() >= business_day_start.time():
                    bhour = other - business_day_start
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += bhour
                        other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 17, 0, 0) - timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 17, 0, 0) - timedelta(days=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
