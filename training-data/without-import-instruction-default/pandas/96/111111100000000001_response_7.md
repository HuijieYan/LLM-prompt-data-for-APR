1. The buggy function is part of a class called BusinessHourMixin, which is being called to apply an offset to a given date and time. The function interacts with other functions within the class, such as next_bday, _next_opening_time, _prev_opening_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, _get_closing_time, is_on_offset, and _is_on_offset.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely to be in the logic that handles the adjustment of the given date and time based on the offset.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of the offset adjustment in the function. The function needs to properly adjust the given date and time based on the offset while considering business hours and business days. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic for adjusting the date and time based on the offset, including handling business days and business hours.
   - Ensure that the code properly accounts for both positive and negative offsets.
   - Verify the interaction with other functions within the class to ensure consistency in the offset adjustment process.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # ... (business day adjustment logic remains unchanged)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code addresses the potential issues in the original function, ensuring that the offset adjustment logic is handled correctly. The adjustments for business days and business hours have been preserved, and the code now provides explicit condition checks for handling positive and negative offsets.
