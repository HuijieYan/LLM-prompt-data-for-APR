The buggy function is an apply function that is used to adjust date and time according to business hours and holidays. The GitHub issue reported that when using the pd.date_range with periods and adding holidays, it produces more than the specified number of periods.

The potential error location within the function is the date adjustment logic based on business hours, which seems to be causing the unexpected behavior when holidays are added.

The bug's cause is that the function incorrectly adjusts the date and time based on business hours without correctly accounting for holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are included.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the date adjustment logic considers holidays when calculating the number of business hours.
2. Checking the logic for business day adjustment and accounting for holidays appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a business hour
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            other = self.rollforward(other)
            return other
        # If other is a business day
        elif isinstance(self, CustomBusinessDay):
            other = self.apply(other)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour or business day with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes checks to differentiate between business hours and business days, and handles the date and time adjustments accordingly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the date adjustments are correctly made based on business hours and holidays.
