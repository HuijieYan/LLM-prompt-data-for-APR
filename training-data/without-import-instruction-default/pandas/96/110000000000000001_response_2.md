1. The buggy function seems to be a method for manipulating datetime objects based on business hours. However, it contains several conditional checks and calculations that may be causing unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the conditional checks and adjustments for business days, remaining business hours, and the handling of business time intervals.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of business day adjustments, miscalculations of remaining business hours, or inaccuracies in moving between business time intervals.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for business day adjustments and ensuring that it accurately adjusts the datetime object.
   - Double-checking the calculations for remaining business hours and verifying that they are correctly applied to the datetime object.
   - Ensuring that moving between business time intervals is accurately implemented, considering edge cases and conditions.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = timedelta(days=abs(bd))
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code, adjustments to business days and remaining business hours have been simplified and potentially improved. Some minor changes have also been made, such as using `timedelta(days=abs(bd))` for business day adjustments and updating the conditional checks within the while loop.
