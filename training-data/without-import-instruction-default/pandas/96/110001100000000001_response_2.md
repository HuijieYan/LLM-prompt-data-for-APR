Potential Error Location: The main potential error location is within the while loops where the bhour_remain is adjusted. The if conditions within the while loops are not properly handling the adjustment of bhour_remain.

Bug's Cause:
The while loops in the buggy function are not properly adjusting bhour_remain, leading to incorrect calculations of the bhour and bhour_remain values. This is causing the function to return the incorrect output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic within the while loops to ensure that bhour_remain is properly adjusted.
2. Double check the conditions within the while loops to accurately handle the adjustment of the bhour_remain value.
3. Evaluate the use of timedelta comparisons within the while loops to ensure accurate calculations.

The Corrected Code:
