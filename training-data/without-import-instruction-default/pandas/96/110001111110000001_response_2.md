The error seems to be caused by the `apply` function. This function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime, but it seems to contain some issues related to the adjustment of the datetime based on business hours.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to create a date range with custom business hours as frequency, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to the frequency not conforming to the passed values.

The potential issue lies in the logic of adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours. It seems that the adjustment process is not properly handling the offset calculation for the business hours.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime with respect to business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensure that the datetime adjustments for positive and negative offsets are correctly handled.
3. Validate that the business hour offset is being properly applied to the given datetime.
4. Verify that the adjustment process is conforming to the expected frequency.

Corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start = pd.Timestamp(other).floor('D') + pd.Timedelta(hours=self.start.hour, minutes=self.start.minute)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() < self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = start + (other - start) // self + n * self
            else:
                other = start + ((other - start) // self + 1) * self
        else:
            if other.time() >= self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = start + (other - start) // self + n * self
            else:
                other = start + ((other - start) // self - 1) * self
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the issues with adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hour offset and should pass the failing test.
