1. Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is called when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, but it's not producing the expected result. The error message indicates a problem with the frequency validation.
- The GitHub issue reports that when using `pd.date_range` with a period and holidays, it produces more periods than expected.

2. Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the logic that handles adjusting the dates based on the business hour frequency and holidays.

3. Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the adjustment of dates when using a custom business hour frequency and holidays. This causes `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results, leading to a frequency validation error.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the logic for handling dates with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
- Ensure that the adjustment of dates takes into account the specified holidays and produces the expected number of periods.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain the same)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)
            n = self.n
            adjusted_other = None

            if n >= 0:
                adjusted_other = self._adjust_for_positive_n(other)
            else:
                adjusted_other = self._adjust_for_negative_n(other)

            return adjusted_other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _adjust_for_positive_n(self, other):
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        adjusted_other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, self.n)

        return adjusted_other

    def _adjust_for_negative_n(self, other):
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        adjusted_other = self._adjust_for_business_days(other, self.n)

        return adjusted_other

    def _adjust_for_business_days(self, other, n):
        businessdays = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=n)
        adjusted_other = other + businessdays

        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)
            remain = adjusted_other - prev_open
            adjusted_other = prev_open + businessdays + remain

        return adjusted_other
```
This corrected code adjusts the `apply` function to properly handle positive and negative `n` values, taking into account the custom business hour frequency and holidays. It also includes helper methods to handle the adjustment logic for positive and negative `n` values, and to handle adjustments for business days. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
