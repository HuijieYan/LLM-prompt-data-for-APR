1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it involves a CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays, which is similar to the issue reported on GitHub about date_range not working as expected when adding holidays.
2. The potential error location within the buggy function is likely related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments based on the holidays, which seems to be causing the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of holidays and business hours within the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to an incorrect number of periods when holidays are included in the date_range. The code provided in the GitHub issue demonstrates the unexpected behavior observed when adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour frequency, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the logic for adjusting business hours and considering the impact of holidays in the calculation. Additionally, examining how holidays are handled within the CustomBusinessHour frequency and ensuring that the adjustment for holidays is correctly applied to the date_range output.
5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import Hour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.holidays = kwargs.pop("holidays", [])
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def onOffset(self, dt):
        return super().onOffset(dt) and dt not in self.holidays

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
            n = self.n
            start = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
            if n > 0:
                while n > 0:
                    start = start + timedelta(days=1)
                    if self.onOffset(start):
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    start = start - timedelta(days=1)
                    if self.onOffset(start):
                        n += 1
            return start
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Usage example:
import pandas as pd

holidays = ['2020-11-26']
cbh = CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(start='10:00', holidays=holidays)

print(pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=14, freq=cbh))
```
