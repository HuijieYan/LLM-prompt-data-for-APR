1. The buggy function is called "apply" and it's located within the class "BusinessHourMixin" in the file pandas/tseries/offsets.py. This function is trying to handle business hours and adjust the given datetime accordingly. It has references to several related functions within the same class and file, such as _is_on_offset, _next_opening_time, _get_closing_time, _get_business_hours_by_sec, and next_bday.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic used for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days. 

3. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days. Additionally, there may be issues with the calculations involving business hours and the adjustment of the datetime accordingly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days, checking the calculations involving business hours, and ensuring that the adjustment is done accurately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions within the same class remain unchanged

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if n < 0:
                n = -n
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            businessday = 60 * 60 * 24
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            remaining = (r * businessday) / businesshours

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            other += timedelta(days=bd, seconds=remaining)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code:
- Replaced the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days.
- Fixed the condition for comparing the time with the start and end times.
- Adjusted the datetime based on the calculated business days and remaining time.
- Removed unnecessary operations and simplified the logic for better clarity and accuracy.
- Kept the exception handling for input types.
