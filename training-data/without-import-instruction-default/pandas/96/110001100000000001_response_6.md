1. The buggy function `apply` appears to be related to several other functions within the same file, but not the same class. The related functions are `apply_wraps`, `is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_is_on_offset`.
   
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the if-else conditions where the `other` variable is being adjusted based on the value of `n`.

3. The bug's cause is that the adjustments made to the `other` variable inside the if-else conditions are not correctly handling the scenarios for positive and negative values of `n`. Additionally, there are comparisons and adjustments being made on the `bhour_remain` variable that may not be accurately capturing the business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the adjustments made to the `other` variable are accurately handling both positive and negative values of `n`.
   - Reviewing the comparisons and adjustments made on the `bhour_remain` variable to ensure they are accurately capturing the remaining business hours.

5. Corrected code for the buggy function `apply`:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # business hours calculation
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # calculations for adjusting business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            # logic for adjusting by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            # logic for adjusting remaining business hours for positive n
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            # logic for adjusting remaining business hours for negative n
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` and revises the comparisons and adjustments made to the `bhour_remain` variable, ensuring they accurately capture the remaining business hours.
