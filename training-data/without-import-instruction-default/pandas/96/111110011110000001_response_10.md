The buggy function is part of a class called `BusinessHourMixin`. The function is named `apply` and is aimed at adjusting a timestamp based on business hours. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is calling the `apply` function and is expecting a specific result for a given set of inputs. However, the output of the `apply` function does not match the expected result, leading to a ValueError.

The potential error in the buggy function seems to be related to the adjustment of timestamps based on business days and business hours. There are multiple conditional branches and calculations in the function that could potentially lead to incorrect adjustments or offsets.

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect calculation in the `apply` function, resulting in the timestamps not being adjusted properly based on the business hours and days. This leads to the failing test and the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the timestamps based on business hours and days needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially re-implemented. The conditional branches and calculations within the function need to be analyzed to ensure that the adjustments are being made correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjusting logic
            adjusted_time = other
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function simplifies the adjustment logic to ensure that the timestamp is correctly adjusted based on the business hours and days. Further testing should be done to verify the correctness of the adjusted timestamps, but this should address the issue raised in the failing test.
