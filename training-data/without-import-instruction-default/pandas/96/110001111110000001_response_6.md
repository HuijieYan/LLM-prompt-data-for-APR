The buggy function is `apply` which is trying to adjust a given date and time with a specified business offset. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of the function with a custom business hour offset. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised during frequency validation. The traceback also mentions that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, indicating a potential issue with frequency validation.

The error is occurring due to the frequency validation not being performed correctly, leading to a mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

To fix the bug:
1. The frequency validation process needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the inferred frequency is accurately determined and compared with the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.Timestamp)):
        rhs = pd.to_datetime(other)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if rhs.floor("T") not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(rhs):
                other = self._next_opening_time(rhs)
        else:
            if rhs.floor("T") in self.start:
                other = rhs - pd.Timedelta(1, "s")
            if not self._is_on_offset(rhs):
                other = self._next_opening_time(rhs)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        timedelta_1d = pd.Timedelta(1, "D")
        business_hours = sum(
            (e - s).seconds // 60 for s, e in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n), business_hours)
        if n < 0:
            business_days = -business_days
            remaining_hours = -remaining_hours

        if business_days != 0:
            business_seconds = business_days * timedelta_1d.total_seconds()
            other += pd.Timedelta(seconds=business_seconds)

        if remaining_hours != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_hours > 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_time = (next_open - other).seconds // 60

                    if remaining_hours >= business_time:
                        other = next_open
                        remaining_hours -= business_time
                    else:
                        other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0
            else:
                while remaining_hours < 0:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    business_time = (other - prev_open).seconds // 60

                    if abs(remaining_hours) >= business_time:
                        other = prev_open
                        remaining_hours += business_time
                    else:
                        other -= pd.Timedelta(minutes=abs(remaining_hours))
                        remaining_hours = 0

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected code, the function should now perform the required adjustments to a given date and time based on the specified business offset, and it should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
