The issue appears to be with the `apply` function in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. It seems that the `apply` function does not correctly handle the custom business hours. The logic for adjusting the business hours and dates appears to be incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
        end_time = other.replace(hour=self.end.hour, minute=self.end.minute)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > end_time.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < start_time.time():
                other = other.replace(
                    hour=self.end.hour, minute=self.end.minute, second=0, microsecond=0
                )
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._prev_opening_time(other)
                ) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or (bhour_remain == bhour and not pd.isna(other.nanosecond))
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The changes made to the function include correcting the logic for comparing times, updating the conditions for adjusting the business day and remaining business hours, and using the `pd.isna()` function to check for the presence of nanoseconds.

After making these changes, the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass without any errors.
