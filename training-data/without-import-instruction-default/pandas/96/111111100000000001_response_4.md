The buggy function is called "apply" and it is within the class "BusinessHourMixin" in the file "offsets.py". It has multiple issues such as incorrect variable usage, missing method calls (e.g., self._prev_opening_time), and incorrect conditional checks.

The potential error is likely to be in the calculation of the adjusted time. There are various conditions and calculations to handle business hours, business days, and time intervals, making it prone to errors.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the business hour adjustments and the conditional checks for the direction of the adjustment (n >= 0 or n < 0). Other potential causes could be the incorrect usage of methods like self._next_opening_time and self._get_closing_time, and the incorrect usage of timedelta to perform the adjustments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Correcting the variable usage and ensuring that the correct methods are called as needed.
2. Simplifying the code to handle positive and negative values of n separately, reducing the number of conditions and calculations required.
3. Ensuring that the adjustments to the input datetime object are performed correctly and consistently.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # business days adjustment
            business_days = n // (businesshours // 60)
            other += timedelta(days=business_days)
            
            # remaining business hours adjustment
            remaining_hours = n % (businesshours // 60)
            business_time = self._get_business_time(other)
            if remaining_hours < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(business_time - timedelta(minutes=abs(remaining_hours)))
            else:
                other = business_time + timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, there are simplified conditional checks for adjusting positive and negative values of n, and the adjustments are calculated based on business days and remaining hours separately. The code is more straightforward and less prone to errors. Additionally, the usage of self._get_business_time is added to handle the business hours adjustments.
