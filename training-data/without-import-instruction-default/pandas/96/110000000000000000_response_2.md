To correct the buggy function, the following changes can be made:

1. Add an import statement for the datetime module since the function is referencing the datetime class.
2. Add the missing apply_wraps decorator, assuming it's a custom decorator that should be used for the function.
3. Correct the comparison of the datetime class by adding the correct import statement and modifying the isinstance() condition as follows: isinstance(other, datetime.datetime)

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# assuming apply_wraps is a custom decorator
def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime) and isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # rest of the code...
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

These changes include adding the missing import statement for the datetime module, updating the isinstance() condition to check for both datetime and datetime.datetime classes, and maintaining the logic provided in the original function.
