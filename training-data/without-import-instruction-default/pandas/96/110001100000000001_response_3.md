1. The buggy function is applying some business hour offset to a datetime object. It appears to be adjusting the datetime by adding or subtracting business days and business hours based on the offset value. However, there are multiple references to functions from the same file but different classes, such as `_is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`. These functions are used within the buggy function to perform the datetime adjustments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the calculation and adjustment of the business hour offset. There are also multiple conditional statements that handle different cases of positive and negative offset values.

3. The main cause of the bug is likely to be related to incorrect calculations and adjustments of the datetime based on the business hour offset. The use of the mentioned related functions within the buggy function suggests that the bug could be due to incorrect logic in these functions or incorrect implementation of the adjustments within the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Review and debug each related function, such as `_is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, to ensure that they are correctly implementing the required logic for datetime adjustments.
   b. Refactor the buggy function to simplify the datetime adjustments and remove unnecessary or redundant code.
   c. Test the buggy function with various input datetime and offset values to identify specific scenarios where the bug occurs.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class ApplyTypeError(Exception):
    pass

class BusinessDay:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
