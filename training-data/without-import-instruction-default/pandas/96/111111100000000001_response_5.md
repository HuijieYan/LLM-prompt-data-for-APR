The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and it performs manipulations on datetime objects based on business hours. The main issue in the code seems to be related to the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours. It appears that the bug may be caused by incorrect adjustment logic that doesn't cover all edge cases or improperly handles negative values for `n`.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure that it covers all possible scenarios for adding or subtracting business hours from the input `other` datetime. Additionally, it's important to verify that the conditions for checking if `other` is on an offset are properly handled.

Here's the corrected code with potential adjustments made to the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
      # other methods from the class BusinessHourMixin ...

    # this is the corrected and refactored function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            if n >= 0:
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment logic has been simplified to iterate through the steps of checking if the `other` datetime is on an offset, then applying the necessary adjustments to move it to an offset. The conditional statements and looping structure have been refactored to handle both positive and negative values for `n` and to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly.
