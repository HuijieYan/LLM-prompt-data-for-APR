The bug in the provided function is that it is using `datetime` without properly importing it. Additionally, the code contains references to several undefined variables (`datetime`, `BusinessMixin`, `BusinessDay`, `timedelta`, etc.). To fix these issues, we need to import the required modules and classes, define the missing variables, and make necessary adjustments to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
import numpy as np

def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function
    pass

class BusinessDay:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(self, other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self, other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(self, other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self, other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self, other)

            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _next_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass

# Test function
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    # GH 30593
    freq = CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    pd.testing.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
``` 

The main improvement made here is in the import section, and defining necessary classes and methods. This should address the issues and make the function executable without errors.
