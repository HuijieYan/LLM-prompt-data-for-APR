1. The buggy function is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours, but it seems to have some issues with handling holidays and computing the correct number of periods.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling holidays and is producing more periods than expected. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user is observing unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the frequency. The function is not correctly adjusting for holidays and is producing extra periods.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to review and refactor the logic for adjusting datetime based on business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, the function should be modified to properly handle holidays and adjust the periods accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for adjusting datetime based on business hours and holidays
        freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
        return freq.apply(other)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected code, the logic for adjusting datetime based on business hours and holidays is handled by using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. This should resolve the issue of producing extra periods when holidays are added, as it properly accounts for holidays in the frequency.
