To correct the buggy function, we need to make sure that the `apply` function returns a `datetime` object. The `datetime` object should be adjusted according to the given parameters such as `start`, `periods`, and `freq`.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        total_seconds = sum((end - start).total_seconds() for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))
        business_hour_seconds = total_seconds / 60  # Convert to minutes

        # Calculate business days and remaining seconds
        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hour_seconds // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds

        result = start_time

        # Adjust by business days
        if business_days != 0:
            if business_days > 0:
                for _ in range(business_days):
                    result = result + timedelta(days=1)
                    while result.weekday() > 4 or result in self.holidays:
                        result = result + timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                for _ in range(abs(business_days)):
                    result = result - timedelta(days=1)
                    while result.weekday() > 4 or result in self.holidays:
                        result = result - timedelta(days=1)

        # Handle remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_seconds > 0:
                result = result + timedelta(minutes=1)
                if result.hour in self.end and result.minute == 0:  # Check if outside business hour
                    result = result.replace(minute=self.start[result.hour])  # Set to the next opening time
                    if result.second != 0:
                        result = result.replace(second=0)
        else:
            while remaining_seconds > 0:
                result = result - timedelta(minutes=1)
                if result.hour in self.start and result.minute == 0:  # Check if outside business hour
                    result = result.replace(minute=self.end[result.hour - 1])  # Set to the previous closing time
                    if result.second != 0:
                        result = result.replace(second=0)

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function handles the business day adjustment and remaining business hour adjustment for positive and negative `n` values. This should resolve the ValueError encountered in the failing test function.
