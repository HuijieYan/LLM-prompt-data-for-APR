The buggy function is `apply` and appears to be a method of a class, `BusinessHourMixin`. According to the error message provided, it seems that there is an issue with the `apply` function's validation of the frequency. To correct this, you can modify the `apply` function as follows:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # other code ...
        else:
            raise ValueError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the `apply` function to raise a `ValueError` instead of `ApplyTypeError`, this should resolve the issue with the failing test and it will now raise a more appropriate exception type for the problem.
