The buggy function seems to be a part of a datetime manipulation class, where it takes another datetime object as input and manipulates it based on certain conditions. It also makes use of several related functions such as `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, and `next_bday`.

The potential error location within the buggy function may be related to the manipulation of the `other` datetime object based on whether `n` is greater than or equal to 0. It seems that the condition for adjusting the datetime object may not be correctly handled, leading to potential incorrect manipulation of the datetime object.

The bug's cause may be due to incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on the value of `n`. This could lead to incorrect results when manipulating the datetime object, especially in the cases where `n` is less than 0.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing and correcting the condition for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the value of `n`. Additionally, thorough testing with different input datetime objects and `n` values should be performed to ensure the correctness of the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
