The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust a datetime based on business hours. The function involves several calculations and adjustments to determine the adjusted datetime based on the business hours.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of creating a date range with custom business hours, and it is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the logic that calculates and adjusts the datetime based on business hours. There might be an issue with the way the adjustments are being made, leading to an incorrect frequency validation, which results in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly. Additionally, checking the frequency validation and ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior for custom business hours.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions)

    # The corrected buggy function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By reviewing the logic and making necessary adjustments, the corrected `apply` function should address the issue and pass the failing test.
