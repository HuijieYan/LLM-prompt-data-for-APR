The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which appears to be related to manipulating business hours. The failing test is checking for custom business hours and dates, which triggers a ValueError related to frequency validation. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the frequency calculation and adjustment logic, specifically in the parts where it is manipulating the time intervals and adjusting for business days and business hours.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments to the datetime objects based on business days and business hours, leading to an incompatible frequency being inferred.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime objects for business days and business hours are accurate and don't result in an incompatible frequency being inferred.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd
import datetime

class BusinessHourMixin:

    ...

    @classmethod
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            n = self.n

            freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

            adjusted_time = freq.rollforward(other)
            business_index = pd.date_range(start=adjusted_time, periods=2)

            return business_index[1]

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we have made the following changes:
1. Imported the relevant classes and modules.
2. Changed the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and business hours using the CustomBusinessHour class.
3. Utilized the CustomBusinessHour to roll the datetime forward to the next business hour.
4. Created a BusinessIndex to return the next business hour.

This corrected code should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
