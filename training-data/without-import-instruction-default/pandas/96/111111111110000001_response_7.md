Analysis:
The problematic function is using an `apply_wraps` decorator, but the decorator function is not provided in the given source code. This seems to be the cause of the error. Additionally, the function is not importing `datetime` correctly and is missing the necessary import statements.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `apply_wraps` decorator from the `apply` function since the decorator function is not provided.
2. Add the necessary import statements at the beginning of the file, specifically for `datetime`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The necessary import statement for datetime
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... previous code remains unchanged ...

    # this is the corrected and fixed version of the function
    def apply(self, other):
        # removed the @apply_wraps decorator
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # ... remaining code remains unchanged ...

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hours with datetime")
```

With these changes, the corrected code should address the issue and pass the failing test.
