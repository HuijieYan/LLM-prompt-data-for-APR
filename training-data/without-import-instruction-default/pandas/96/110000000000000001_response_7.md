1. The buggy function takes in two datetime objects and attempts to perform a calculation based on business hours. However, there are several potential error locations within the code such as incorrect logic in the adjustment of business days and business hours, potential incorrect time comparisons, and potential incorrect time adjustments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation of business days and adjustment of remaining business hours.

3. The bug's cause may be due to incorrect logic in adjusting business days and remaining business hours, potential incorrect time comparisons, and potential incorrect time adjustments within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve carefully reviewing the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, ensuring correct time comparisons and adjustments, and overall simplifying the code for better readability and maintainability.

5. Corrected code:
```python
