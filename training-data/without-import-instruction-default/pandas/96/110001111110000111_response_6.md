The buggy function is the `apply` function located in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime, but it is failing when provided with a holiday parameter.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday. The expected output does not match the actual output, leading to a `ValueError`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency validation, and it seems to be related to the way the custiom business hour frequency is handled when holidays are provided.

The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where providing holidays results in the creation of more than the specified number of periods in the date range.

To fix the bug, we need to review the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file to ensure that it handles the holiday parameter correctly and does not introduce extra periods in the date range.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic of the `apply` function to exclude the holidays when calculating the date range, ensuring that the specified number of periods is respected.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ignore the timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By removing the logic related to handling holidays and adjusting the date range based on the holiday, we can ensure that the function respects the specified number of periods and does not introduce unexpected dates.

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the date range is created correctly even when holidays are provided.
