Certainly! Here is the full corrected code of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # adjust by business days first
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self.get_total_business_hours_by_minutes())

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
                other += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # ensure the adjusted time is within business hours
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other -= min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # ensure the adjusted time is within business hours

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues with adjusting the datetime based on business hours and ensures that the adjusted time remains within the business hours.
