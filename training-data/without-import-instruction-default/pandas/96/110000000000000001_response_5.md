The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours for both positive and negative values of 'n'.

The bug is caused by the improper handling of business day adjustments and remaining business hours. The function is not accurately adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours specified by 'n'.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours for both positive and negative values of 'n'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ApplyTypeError(Exception):
    pass

def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = timedelta(days=abs(bd))
            if n < 0:
                skip_bd = -skip_bd
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
