1. The buggy function seems to be designed to combine business hours with a datetime object. It adjusts the datetime based on the specified business hours and returns the adjusted datetime. However, there are several potential issues with the function, such as incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function include:
   - Incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours
   - Incorrect handling of business time intervals

3. The bug's cause appears to be the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, as well as the incorrect handling of business time intervals.

4. possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic for adjusting business days and business hours.
   - Verify the calculations for remaining business hours and adjust the logic if necessary.
   - Ensure that the handling of business time intervals is accurate and consistent.

5. Here's the corrected code with the bug fixed:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ApplyTypeError(Exception):
    pass

def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            (en - st).seconds // 60
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=bd)

        if n >= 0:
            while r > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r < bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while r < 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_closing_time(other)
                if abs(r) < bhour.seconds // 60 or (abs(r) == bhour.seconds // 60 and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r += bhour.seconds // 60
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
