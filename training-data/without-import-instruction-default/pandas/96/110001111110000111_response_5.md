The buggy function is the `apply` function, which is intended to apply offsets to datetime objects. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the `pd.date_range` function, which should generate a date range with custom business hours and holidays.

The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation, specifically when the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The GitHub issue describes how adding holidays to the `pd.date_range` call with custom business hours results in more periods than expected, indicating a potential issue with how holidays are handled in conjunction with business hours.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours to ensure proper handling of holidays.
2. Ensuring that the adjustment logic considers the presence of holidays and adjusts the datetime accordingly.
3. Verifying that the frequency generation in the date range function takes into account the custom business hours and holidays.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd


def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should handle the adjustment for holidays along with the business hours, ensuring that the date range generation takes into account the specified custom business hours and holidays as expected.
