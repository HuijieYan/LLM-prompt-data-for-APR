The buggy function is `apply` and it seems to be related to time and date calculations. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing a CustomBusinessHour frequency, and the error occurs when trying to create the expected DatetimeIndex.

The potential error in the `apply` function might be related to the way it is handling the time calculations, especially when adjusting the time based on the business hours and days.

The bug seems to be causing the `apply` function to incorrectly adjust the time based on business hours and days, leading to an incorrect DatetimeIndex being created. This results in a ValueError being raised during the test due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic within the `apply` function, especially the parts related to adjusting time based on business hours and days.
2. Ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime objects are accurate and align with the expected behavior of a CustomBusinessHour frequency.
3. Verify that the calculation of business days and hours is done correctly, accounting for both positive and negative cases of `n`.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            other = other + pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(n=1, start=other.time(), holidays=self.holidays)
            if other.weekday() in self.weekmask:
                n -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code:
- Adjustments to the datetime object are made in a loop based on whether `n` is positive or negative, ensuring that the correct CustomBusinessHour frequency is applied.
- The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and holidays is simplified and generalized.
- The corrected code should now pass the failing test.
