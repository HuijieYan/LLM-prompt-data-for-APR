The buggy function `apply` is a method of the class `BusinessHourMixin`. It seems to be part of the pandas library, specifically related to business time offsets.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of generating a date range with custom business hours and holidays. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the frequency validation of the date range, as inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH.

The potential error location within the problematic function is suspected to be in the logic related to adjusting the business hours in the `apply` method. It seems like the logic for adjusting the business hours might be incorrect, leading to the validation failure for the frequency.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` method needs to be carefully reviewed and revised to ensure that the business hours are being adjusted correctly. The logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` (representing the number of business hours to add or subtract) needs to be thoroughly checked.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust the logic for positive and negative values of n
        if self.n >= 0:
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the above correction only addresses the potential issue in the `apply` method related to business hour adjustments. Other parts of the codebase, such as other methods in the `BusinessHourMixin` class or other related classes, could also be contributing to the bug. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the entire business hour handling logic might be necessary.
