1. The buggy function apply has a logical error that is causing the failing test. The function is meant to adjust a given datetime to the next business hour based on certain criteria, but it is not doing so correctly.

2. The potential error location is within the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours. The function attempts to calculate the business hours, adjust the input datetime, and handle different cases for different offsets, but there seems to be a flaw in the logic.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function: The apply function is not correctly adjusting the input datetime to the next business hour.
   (b). The buggy class: There is a relationship with the BusinessHourMixin class, which likely includes the logic for business hours and offsets.
   (c). The related functions: There are several helper functions for calculating business hours and adjusting the datetime.
   (d). The failing test and error message: The failing test is trying to use the CustomBusinessHour offset, but the resulting DatetimeIndex does not conform to the expected frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and offsets.
   (b). Check the calculations for business hours and offsets to ensure they are correctly adjusting the input datetime.
   (c). Verify the usage of the CustomBusinessHour offset and its interaction with the apply function.

5. Corrected code for the apply function to fix the bug:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        elif self.n >= 0:
            return self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            return self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
By simplifying the logic and using the existing helper functions, the corrected version of the apply function should pass the failing test. This code performs checks for the input datetime based on the offset and adjusts it accordingly.
