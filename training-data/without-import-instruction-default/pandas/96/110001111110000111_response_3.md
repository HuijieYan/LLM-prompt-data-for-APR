The buggy function is `apply` which is using several internal functions to manipulate datetime objects. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is showing that when using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays, the `pd.date_range` function is producing more periods than expected.

The error message is indicating a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method of DatetimeArray. This indicates that the frequency validation is failing, possibly due to the manipulation of the datetime objects in the buggy function.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency results in more periods in the output than expected.

To fix this bug, the problematic part of the `apply` function needs to be identified and modified such that it correctly handles holidays and does not produce unexpected periods.

One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to review the logic in the `apply` function and ensure that the manipulation of datetime objects is not resulting in extra periods when holidays are added.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# import necessary module
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        new_date = other

        while n != 0:
            new_date += timedelta(hours=1)
            if CustomBusinessHour.is_on_offset(new_date):
                n -= 1

        return new_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic to adjust the datetime based on the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, ensuring that it handles the number of periods correctly, especially when holidays are involved. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
