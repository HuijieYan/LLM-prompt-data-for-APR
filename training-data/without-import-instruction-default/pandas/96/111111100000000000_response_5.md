The function applies a decorator, `apply_wraps`, which is missing from the code provided. The `apply` method's parameters should also include `self` as the first parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that the decorator `apply_wraps` and the `ApplyTypeError` exception should be defined and imported from other parts of the codebase.
