Apologies, the code provided earlier was only a partial correction. Here's the complete corrected function for the buggy code you provided earlier:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def is_on_offset(self, dt):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace

                other.year,
