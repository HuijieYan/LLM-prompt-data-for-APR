1. The buggy function seems to be designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and other parameters. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to test the behavior of this function when using a custom business hour frequency.

2. The potential error location within the `apply` function could be the datetime modifications, adjustments for business days, or calculations of business hours, as the error message from the failing test pertains to a frequency validation issue.

3. The bug's cause appears to be related to the frequency validation within the `apply` function, resulting in an incorrect frequency being inferred from the passed values. This leads to a ValueError stating that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This indicates that the adjustments made to the datetime object might be affecting the frequency validation and subsequent behavior of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the adjustments made to the datetime object, ensuring that they do not interfere with the frequency validation process. Additionally, verifying the calculations related to business hours and business days to ensure they are not causing unexpected effects on the frequency.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

# Corrected function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjusting the datetime object with business hour frequency
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Business day and business hours calculations
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjusting by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.onOffset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Further adjustments based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using CustomBusinessHour and its methods, we aim to ensure that the frequency validation is accurately handled, and the adjustments made to the datetime object are compatible with the specified business hour frequency.
