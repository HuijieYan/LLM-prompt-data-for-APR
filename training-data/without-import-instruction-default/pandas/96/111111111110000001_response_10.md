The bug is caused by the apply method in the BusinessHourMixin class. 

The apply method takes another datetime object as input and tries to adjust it based on certain conditions, but the logic is incorrect and does not handle the CustomBusinessHour case properly, which leads to the ValueError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the apply method to correctly handle the CustomBusinessHour case.

Here's the corrected code for the apply method:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            start_time = other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute)
            if other >= start_time:
                other = start_time + (n * self.offset)
            else:
                other = start_time
        else:
            end_time = other.replace(hour=self.end.hour, minute=self.end.minute)
            if other <= end_time:
                other = end_time + (n * self.offset)
            else:
                other = end_time
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the apply method should handle the CustomBusinessHour correctly and pass the failing test.
