The issue in the `apply` function appears to be related to incorrect handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The `apply` function needs to be modified to properly handle the adjustments with respect to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please note that this corrected version only addresses the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and its adjustments. It may need to be further modified to handle other functionalities based on the requirements of the code.
