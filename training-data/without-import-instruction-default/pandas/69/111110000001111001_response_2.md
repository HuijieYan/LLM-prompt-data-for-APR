The problem with the function is that it is not correctly handling the type of the index when checking if it is an integer. It is assuming that the index is always float, which is not the case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to properly handle the different types of indexes. We can do this by checking the type of the index and then comparing the type of the indexer to the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_int64_dtype(ax) and not pd.api.types.is_float64_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle different types of indexes and indexers, and it satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
