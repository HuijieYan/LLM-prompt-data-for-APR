The bug in the function is that it incorrectly checks whether an index label is an integer, and then tries to verify if the indexer is also an integer. This logic is incorrect and is causing the function to fail. Instead, the function should simply check if the index label and indexer are of the same type, without verifying if they are integer or non-integer.

To fix the bug, the condition checking inside the loop should be modified to compare the types of the index label and the indexer, and the check for integer or non-integer should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(ax) != type(i):
            raise ValueError("Index type does not match the type of the indexer")
    
    return key
```
