Potential error location:

The issue seems to be in the `_convert_key` function where the type of the key is not being handled correctly.

Bug's cause:

The `_convert_key` function checks if the key is an integer, but it does not handle floating-point numbers correctly, resulting in a ValueError when an index with non-integer values is used.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and floating-point keys correctly.
2. Add a check to ensure that the type of the key matches the type of the index.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # check if the key is an integer or float
        if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("Indexers must be integers or floats")
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this updated function, it should handle both integer and floating-point keys correctly, and the ValueError should be resolved when using the float index.

This corrected function should satisfy the test cases provided and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
