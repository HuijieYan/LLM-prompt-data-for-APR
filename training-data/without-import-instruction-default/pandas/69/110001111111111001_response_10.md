The buggy function, `_convert_key`, is designed to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. However, the loop that checks the type of each key is not correctly handling the situation where the key and index are of different types, such as when comparing an integer index with a float key.

The failing test is related to the behavior of the `at` accessor, specifically `ser.at[4]` which should cast to 4.0, matching the behavior of `loc`. The failing test indicates that the function is not handling non-integer keys correctly and is not converting integer keys to float keys when needed.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the key and index are of different types. The function should also be updated to ensure that integer keys are properly handled by converting them to float keys when required.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    converted_key = []

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            i = float(i)
        converted_key.append(i)

    return tuple(converted_key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it ensures that keys are converted to the same type as the index, handling cases where integer keys need to be converted to float keys. This should address the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
