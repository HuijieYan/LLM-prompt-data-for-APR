The issue seems to be with the _convert_key function, which is part of the _AtIndexer class. This function is checking for the type of index and key, but the logic seems to be flawed.

The bug appears to be caused by the condition checks for ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer(). These conditions are checking the attributes of the index ax instead of checking the type of the index itself. This is leading to incorrect validations and possibly raising ValueError in cases where it should not be.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checks inside the for loop to properly validate the types of the index and the key. Additionally, we should also refine the validation process for different types of indexes. 

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have int or float indexers")
        else:
            # default case for other types of indexes
            pass

    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index (datetime, timedelta, float, etc.) and then validates the type of the key accordingly. This should resolve the issues stated in the GitHub issue and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
