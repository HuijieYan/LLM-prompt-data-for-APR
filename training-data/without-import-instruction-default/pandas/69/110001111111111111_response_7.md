The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys based on the type of the index, but it is not handling the cases where the index is a `Float64Index` correctly. This is leading to a ValueError being raised in the cases where the index is non-integer and the key is integer.

The failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is testing lookups in a Series with a `Float64Index` using integer keys. This is causing the `_convert_key` function to raise a `ValueError` because it is not handling these cases correctly.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" is referencing this bug and the fact that it is affecting Series lookups for the `Float64Index` case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle the cases where the index is a `Float64Index` and the keys are of different types.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to explicitly check if the index is a `Float64Index` and handle the integer key cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            i = float(i)
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code explicitly handles the case where the index is a `Float64Index` and converts the keys to float if needed. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
