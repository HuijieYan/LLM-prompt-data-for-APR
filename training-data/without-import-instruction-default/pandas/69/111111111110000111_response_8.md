Analysis:

The buggy function `_convert_key` is meant to require the keys to be the same type as the index, but it currently has a bug that causes it to raise a ValueError in certain cases. The error message indicates that the issue occurs when using "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This suggests that the bug is related to the integer checking logic in the function.

The failing test function is checking the behavior of various indexing methods, such as `get_value`, `[]`, `loc`, `at`, `iloc`, and `iat`, for datetime-like values with a Float64Index. The error occurs specifically when using `ser.at[4]`.

The GitHub issue title and description indicate that this bug affects corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

Bug's Cause:

The bug is caused by the logic in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the part where it checks for integer index and non-integer index. It seems that the logic for handling non-integer indexes is flawed, leading to the ValueError being raised erroneously.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.
2. Modify the integer checking logic to ensure it accurately distinguishes between integer and non-integer indexes.

Corrected Code:

After analyzing the bug, here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
