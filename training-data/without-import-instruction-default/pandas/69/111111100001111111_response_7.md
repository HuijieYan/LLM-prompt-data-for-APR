The issue is likely within the for loop in the `_convert_key` function. The function is meant to check if the index and key have the same type, but it currently only checks if the key is an integer. 

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of non-integer keys when the index is a DateTime index. The function should also check if the index is a DateTime index and then handle non-integer keys accordingly.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to first check if the index is a DateTime index, and then handle non-integer keys based on the index type.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index "
                    "can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
  ```

This corrected code should handle both integer and non-integer keys for both DateTime indexes and other types of indexes. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
