The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to require the keys to be the same type as the index in order to avoid fallback. The function is checking for the type of index and whether it's an integer or not. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `test_numeric.py` is producing a `ValueError` with the error message stating "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that the function is not handling non-integer based indexing properly.

The issue in the function arises when it checks for non-integer indexing. The condition for checking if a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers is incorrect, which is causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the condition within the for loop should be modified to handle non-integer indexing properly. Also, the condition to check if a value is an integer can be modified to use the `is_integer` method instead of `is_integer()`. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float) or isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the non-integer indexing scenarios properly and pass the failing test.
