The buggy function is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index. However, there are several issues with the current implementation.

1. The function incorrectly checks if the index is an integer using the `is_integer()` method, which is incorrect. It should use the `is_integer` attribute of the index instead.
2. The function should return a list of keys if it is a setter, but it returns the key as is even if it's a setter.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Convert `ax.is_integer()` to `ax.is_integer` to properly check if the index is an integer index.
2. Return a list of keys if it is a setter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return list(key)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input parameters and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
