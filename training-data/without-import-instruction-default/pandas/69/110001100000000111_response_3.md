Analysis:
The buggy function _convert_key is responsible for converting keys based on certain conditions. The function seems to be checking the type of the index and the type of the key and throwing errors if they do not match. This can cause issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the for loop where it checks the type of the key against the type of the index.

Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling cases involving the Float64Index properly. This is leading to issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which is mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the for loop to handle cases involving the Float64Index properly.
2. Review the conditions for checking the type of the key and index and ensure they handle all edge cases, including the Float64Index case.
3. Consider using built-in pandas functions to handle the type checking and conversion of keys.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype == 'float64':
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.dtype == 'int64':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Unsupported index type"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected code above updates the logic in the for loop to handle cases involving the Float64Index properly. It also checks the type of the index using the dtype attribute and ensures that the key matches the index type. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
