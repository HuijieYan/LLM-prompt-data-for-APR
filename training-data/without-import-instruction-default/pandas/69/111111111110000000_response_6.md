To fix the buggy function, we need to iterate through the index and ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. Additionally, we need to check whether the index is an integer index or a non-integer index. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The function was updated to properly handle non-integer indexes and integer indexes based on the keys provided by the function. With this fix, the test cases should pass without raising a ValueError as shown in the error message.
