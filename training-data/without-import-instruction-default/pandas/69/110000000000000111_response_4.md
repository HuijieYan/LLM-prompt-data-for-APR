1. The buggy function is a method called "_convert_key" which seems to be related to index conversion in a data structure. The GitHub issue mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which suggests that there might be issues with converting keys for index lookup.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where it checks for integer type and non-integer type indexers.

3. The cause of the bug may be that the function is not correctly handling integer and non-integer type indexers for the Float64Index case, leading to issues with series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the logic for handling integer and non-integer type indexers to ensure it aligns with the requirements for the Float64Index case.
   - Adding specific handling for Float64Index to address any specific behaviors or constraints related to this index type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Int64Index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the specific requirements for Float64Index, Int64Index and non-integer indexes, ensuring that the key conversion aligns with the GitHub issue's description.
