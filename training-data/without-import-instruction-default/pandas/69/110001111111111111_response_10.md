The `buggy function` is `_convert_key` from `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is designed to require keys to be the same type as the index, and it allows for arbitrary setting if the `is_setter` flag is `True`. The function then iterates through the axes and keys, checking for integer and non-integer indexing. The current issue with the function is that it raises a `ValueError` for non-integer indexing even when the input is valid.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py is failing with a `ValueError` for the `ser.at[4]` call. The function is expecting a cast from `int` to `float`, but this is not happening.

The expected results are not being met because the function is not handling the different data types (datetime vs float) and their interactions correctly.

Based on the failing test and input/output variable information, the bug is likely due to the function not correctly handling the casting of integer and non-integer indices for datetime and timedelta values.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the different data types and their interactions.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic in the loop that checks for integer and non-integer indices. For datetime and timedelta values, the function should allow for the casting of integer to float, as this is a valid operation. Additionally, the function should not raise a `ValueError` for non-integer indexing if the input is valid.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
            # Allow for casting from int to float for datetime and timedelta indices
            i = float(i)
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle the different data types and their interactions correctly, allowing for the expected results in the failing test and addressing the issue posted on GitHub.
